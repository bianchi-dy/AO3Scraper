Welcome to this fun little RP Accident and I are doing. Prepare for good old-fashioned Omega/Alpha smut, and lots of bossy John. I've made a few minor edits after our RP, mainly spelling and the such, and fixing a few areas I figured might need clarification. But mostly, you're getting it raw, as our brains spat it out mostly during the middle of the night for both of us. ;)

Hope you enjoy, and prepare yourself, this has about 45 pages on google docs so far, and we're not done ( ^ [?]? ^)

""John? John Watson?"" Mike says from the park bench he's sitting on. ""It's me. Mike Stamford, from Bart's. I know, I got fat."" He chuckles.

""Yes, hello,"" John says automatically, without registering who Mike was. His mind had been elsewhere, worry dragging him down even as the sun shined around him. Oh, Mike!

Recognition flickered across his face. Making a vague comment about the weight gain, he stuck out his hand. ""Been a while. Alright?""

""Same old same old. Working at Bart's."" Mike smiles and shakes John's hand. ""Teaching bright young things like we used to be. God, I hate them."" He chuckles. ""Last I heard you were off getting shot somewhere. What happened with that?""

""I got shot,"" John says tersely, his hand reflexively reaching for his leg, despite the wound being in his shoulder. ""Just got back, though I can't afford London. Not on an Army pension.""

""Couldn't stand to be anywhere else,"" Mike smirks and follows John to get a coffee and catch up.

""Mmm, Harry's no help either."" Pursing his lips John feels his pocket for spare change, then passes a few coins over to a vendor selling coffee and tea to other park patrons. ""Have you tried finding a flatshare? Impossible these days, not like in Uni.""

""You're the second person to say that to me today."" Mike takes a sip from his steaming cup.

""Second?"" Glancing in surprise at his old friend John follows Mike's lead and takes a sip from his still too hot coffee, burning his mouth in the process. ""Who else?""

Sherlock growls as he whips the corpse mercilessly, matching the speed, strength, and intensity as much as he could from the body at the crime scene. He looks up when the door opens, seeing Molly giving him that mousy wide-eyed stare.

Later Sherlock looks up when the lab door opens, seeing Mike Stamford come in with a man walking with a cane. ""Fancier than when we were here."" Mike chuckles.

John mutters something that even he couldn't discern and gave Mike one of those polite smiles you give when you bump into someone you vaguely remember at the grocery store.

He scans the room, noticing how correct Mike's words were. Back in his day, Bart's had been able to boast having all the best equipment, and it seemed that hadn't changed over the years.However, halfway through his inspection, he saw a man hunched over one of the tables, a dropper full of clear liquid in one hand.""Is that him?"" he wondered.

""Mike, can I borrow your phone? I can't get a signal."" Sherlock says, looking Mike and the mystery man over.

Mike feels his pockets. ""Sorry. Left it in my coat.""

""Uh, here, use mine?"" John said, offering before his mind had time to catch up to his words.The man walked towards him, his full height evident as he slid off the stool.

He wasn't wearing a lab coat, or the tattier clothing favoured by broke med students. Instead, he was in a two-piece suit, the collar a crisp white shirt hugging his chin.

The collar hid the man's neck from John, but he didn't have to look to know there wouldn't be a bite there. The man was oozing alpha, from the way he walked to the arrogant set of his shoulders.

John gripped his cane tightly in his hand while holding out his mobile as the man approached.Mike, an Alpha? Seriously? John thought, glancing furiously over a Mike who just smiled at him.

""Afghanistan or Iraq?"" Sherlock asks as he types furiously.

""Afghanistan, wait how did you know?"" John stared, mouth gaping open as the cold words hit him. It had been a common enough question in the army, soldiers sizing each other up, looking to see who had the better stories.

""How?"" He repeated, once again glancing over to Mike, wondering if perhaps Mike had given Sherlock a heads up. Mike shakes his head and raises his hands to show his innocence.

""Everything about you screams military. The way you walk, talk and breathe. When you entered you surveyed the entire room but not to see what had changed but for threats. You may be overly cautious but your posture and hair cut give you away. Your face and hands are tanned but it's less so under your cuffs and collar. Buttoned up tight somewhere with a lot of sun and military posturing. Mike made a comment that a lot has changed since your day so Military doctor then. Only two choices with sunny active military conflict, Afghanistan or Iraq."" Sherlock finishes sending his text and hands the phone back. He looks the man over, taking in the psychosomatic limp. Interesting

""If you'll both excuse me I have to go down to the morgue, left my riding crop."" Sherlock pulls on his coat and heads for the door. ""We'll look at the flat tomorrow.""

""Look at the flat? I don't even know where it is, or anything about you? I can tell you're an Alpha, but nothing else.""

John groaned as he glared daggers at Mike who smiles apologetically. ""I don't even have your number.""

""You know that I wouldn't be here if I didn't know what I was doing and that I wouldn't observe everything about you without quite the impressive intellect. You need a flat and I have my eye on the place. Together we should be able to afford it. The name is Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street. Good day."" Sherlock winks and he's gone.

""Yeah. He's always like that."" Mike chuckles.

""He's... intense."" John sighs, scratching his eyebrow. ""Bit off-kilter for an alpha to just take up lodging with someone, without... asking. Did you tell him?""

""Swear to god, I haven't said a word. That's yours to tell, not mine."" Mike said as they walked out of the lab together.

""Right... ta.""

Going to see the flat...

Sherlock pays the cabbie as it stops outside 221B the next day. ""Afternoon."" He says as he gets out of the cab. ""Found the place alright?""

""Mr. Holmes,"" John says, sticking out his hand in greeting. Inwardly he kicked himself. The omega in him knew that Alphas preferred it when Omegas didn't use first names, but John was no ordinary omega. He'd spent years tamping down his secondary biology and was not about to stop just because there was a tall, and admittedly gorgeous Alpha staring down at him.

""Please, call me Sherlock."" Sherlock shakes John's hand, feeling the calluses from well-trained hands. ""We'll be pretending to be a couple after all."" He says as the door opens.

""Oh Sherlock! Come in!"" Mrs. Hudson cooed and shuffled them inside.

""Wait wha-?"" John manages to squeak out before his voice and confusion is drowned out by who he could only presume was the landlady.

Much to John's dismay, they were led up a flight of old wooden stairs. Sherlock bounded up the steps with ease, but John and the older lady both took their time, finding Sherlock already flitting about the cluttered lounge.

""This is quite nice,"" John says, looking around at the clutter, pointing his cane at the fireplace in particular. ""Once we get some of this stuff removed.""

""I... I can tidy."" Sherlock starts to clean up piles.

""Sherlock says you're an army doctor. Thank you for your service. There's two bedrooms if you'll need it."" Mrs. Hudson smiles.

""Of course we'll be needing two bedrooms,"" John begins to say. A loud thud, Sherlock slamming a book down on a table, drew his attention to the Alpha. Sherlock glared at him, and it was only then that John remembered his words about pretending to be a couple.

""I uh, have terrible nightmares most nights. War, and all that.""

Narrowing his eyes he watches as Sherlock returns to stacking books and piles of papers.What the hell is that about? Pretend to be a couple?

""Oh good. It's much easier to rent to couples. Not having all kinds through the house all hours of the day and night."" Mrs. Hudson nods. ""The constant coming and going between unbound Alphas is astonishing. My home is not a brothel.""

""Tea, Mrs. Hudson?"" Sherlock asks as a diversion.

""Not your housekeeper, dear. Just this once."" Mrs. Hudson says as she heads to the kitchen.

Sherlock goes to John. ""The listing is for a couple because she is not able to keep an eye on singles anymore. And they are more likely to be destructive to the property. She's been considering having a hip replacement and I'd much rather be here to assist her without her fussing over it. So if you would please play along this arrangement is beneficial for both of us, John."" He whispers, his height looming over John, not in the usual overpowering aggressive alpha way but more of a protective shielding from everything else.

""You could have mentioned this earlier,"" John hissed though his words got caught in his throat when Sherlock whispered the monthly rent.

""I suppose I can try..."" God, it was cheap. Cheaper than the bedsit he'd been assigned when he'd returned to London. Between his pension, and whatever it was Sherlock made, surely they could afford the flat, with more than enough to spare for food. It wasn't ideal, lodging with an alpha. But John had suppressants at his side and a lifetime worth of ignoring alphas.

""It won't be that hard to pretend. I never bring anyone home and most people keep their distance from me anyway. We just live together. You get a cheap flat in central London and Mrs. Hudson lays off me to find a mate so I can focus on my Work."" Sherlock nods.

""And what work is that?"" John began to ask, but he was interrupted by the landlady who poked her head into the sitting room.

Just until I'm on my feet. John tells himself, moving a stack of papers from the seat a plush armchair he plopped down hard. With a sigh, he stretches out his bad leg and watches as Sherlock continues to flutter about moving one stack of belongings to another location without really cleaning anything up.

""Milk and sugar, Dr. Watson?"" Mrs. Hudson asks.

Outside a car pulls up as Sherlock watches out the window. The door downstairs opens and hurried footsteps on the stairs make their way into the room.

""Where?"" Sherlock asks as a man enters the flat.

""Brixton, Lauriston Gardens."" The man says.

""What's new? You wouldn't come to get me if there wasn't anything new."" Sherlock slips his hands into his trouser pockets.

""You know how they never leave notes? This one did."" The man says. ""Will you come?""

""Not in a panda car. I'll be right behind."" Sherlock nods and the man leaves.

Sherlock jumps around in glee. ""It's Christmas!""

John watches with mild confusion at the scene around him. The newcomer looked familiar, though he couldn't place where or how he would have seen the man. He'd only just arrived in London and hadn't been social.

Once they hear the door shut downstairs, Sherlock begins dashing about, muttering under his breath about ""Anderson, I won't work with him.""

""Make yourself at home, don't wait up,"" Sherlock says, twining his scarf around his neck then dashing down the stairs.

""Always dashing about. But you're more of the sitting down type,"" Mrs. Hudson says.

""Damn my leg!"" John shouts, frustrated with his own limitations. There was something intoxicating in Sherlock's energy that made him want to follow after the Alpha and see what the commotion was about.""

""Sorry... sorry,"" he mutters, though the landlady brushes it off and offers once again to make tea.

""Biscuits too, if you've got them,"" John calls after her, flicking a nearby newspaper open. There on the front page, beside a write-up of the serial suicides, is a picture of D.I. Lestrade, the same man who'd just been in the flat talking with Sherlock.

""You're a doctor. An army doctor. Seen a lot of injuries? Violent deaths? Bit of trouble too I'd imagine."" Sherlock pushes himself off the doorframe and walks over to John. ""Want to see some more?""

John stands, not enjoying the feeling of an Alpha he hardly knows looming over him. Sherlock had a few inches on him, but John knew how to make the most of his body.

Squaring his shoulders he forced himself not to step back when Sherlock encroached on his personal space.

""Enough for a lifetime,"" John replies, then adds, ""Oh god, yes.""

Sherlock smirks and sweeps out of the room, down the stairs.

""Sorry, Mrs. Hudson,"" John calls as he hobbles after the much faster man. ""Off Out,""

That evening is the most fun John had in years. It was even better than his first night in Afghanistan, though not having the constant fear of being shot by insurgents might have had something to do with that.

The evening flashed by, a series of vibrant memories that would stay with John forever. It ended with Sherlock being driven to a college, by the killer. A Taxi driver, no less. His profession allows him to blend in to any crowd.

Following in a separate cab, John has Sherlock's wifi-enabled laptop on his lap, with his mobile pressed to his ear. Desperately trying to get through the series of bored police officers stuck behind a desk.

""DI Lestrade, PLEASE."" John hisses, the urgency in his voice is evident. His heart felt like someone had gripped it with icy fingers.

Eventually, he gets patched through, and John's relieved the DI remembers him. He quickly explains the situation, ends the call, and reaches for the gun in his pocket. It's there, loaded, and ready to go. Not wanting to upset his cab driver, John leaves it where it is.

There are two buildings, both swathed in darkness with only a few lights on here and there by emergency exits. It's a 50/50 shot, and John hopes he's picked the right choice.

He isn't sure why he cares so much about this mad man, a stranger really. But there's something about the Alpha, perhaps just the promise of danger and adventure, that makes John want to hold the man close and never let him go.

John rushes through the empty hall, pushing open unlocked doors, shouting Sherlock's name. Urgency is the key here, not stealth. He chances to look out one of the windows overlooking the other building, the one he did not enter. And sees it.

Sees Sherlock. He's sat at a table, across from the cab driver. The distance is great enough that he can't read their lips, but he is able to see two vials laid out on the table and a gun in the cabbie's hands. John's heart all but stops beating in his chest, time freezes as Sherlock's name rips its way from his throat.

It's over before John has time to think about it. His gun is in his hands, he's used a nearby object to smash in the window. Taking a deep breath, he focuses, then pulls the trigger.

Sherlock rushes to the window as soon as the cabbie drops to see who the shooter was but there was no one to be seen. He goes back to the cabbie and presses his shoe to the man's wound. ""Who! Who is your patron!"" He demanded.

With the cabbie's dying breath he screams ""Moriarty!""

Finally, when he MET and paramedics show up Sherlock is led out. ""What is this? Why've I got this on me?"" Sherlock tugs at the shock blanket around his shoulders.

""It's for shock."" DI Lestrade answers.

""I'm not in shock."" Sherlock scowls.

""I know but some of the lads wanted to take pictures."" Lestrade chuckles. ""So what can you tell me about the shooter?""

As Sherlock is rattling off his deductions he stops, seeing John standing across the police tape looking as normal and ordinary as could be bit Sherlock knew he was anything but.

""Ignore me. Ignore all that."" Sherlock says and stands.

""What?"" Lestrade looks up from his boat road he'd been furiously writing in.

""You can't believe a word I say right now. I'm in shock. See, I've got a blanket."" Sherlock heads to John.

""Where are you going? We still need a statement!"" Lestrade scolds.

""I'll bring him in myself tomorrow. But he needs a meal and sleep. He was kidnapped by a serial killer after all."" John quips.

""Only a fool argues with his doctor,"" Sherlock says smoothly.

""Fine but both of you in my office first thing in the morning,"" Lestrade says as he watches them walk off.

Sherlock holds the police tape for John to duck under.

The gesture is kind and puts a smile on John's face even as Sherlock begins questioning him about powder burns on his fingers.

John's head is still swimming from the compliment *Good Shot*

It had been a good shot, a bloody good shot.

He falls into step beside the giggling Alpha as they leave the scene of flashing lights behind them.

""Dinner?""

""Starving,"" John replies easily, though part of him wonders if that is the *Alpha* talking, or the Man, Sherlock Holmes. He isn't sure which he wants to be asking, but he has a sneaking suspicion it isn't the purely male side.

Sherlock gets a call about multiples alpha bodies and an omega in the center of it all....

Sherlock was shocked at how easy it was to fall into a routine with John. He was worried living with another person would be catastrophic to his thinking not to mention the work but John was different. John made his mind sharper, thinking faster, deductions brighter. He hadn't felt this stable in years or as euphoric without the feeling of a needle piercing his flesh. This was different. He felt like he was soaring and falling all at once but it didn't matter if John was there watching and praising his work.

Sherlock heard Mrs. Hudson's footsteps come up to the flat and he rushed from the table to the couch where John was sitting. He lifted John's laptop from his lap and replaced it with his head, putting John's hand in his hair. He closes his eyes just in time for Mrs. Hudson to walk in with the mail.

""Oi, I was using that."" John grumped, hands still hovering in the air above where his keyboard had been. Instead, he found his fingers hovering directly over Sherlock's mop of curls. That's right, we're pretending to be a couple. This is what couples do.

Anxiety pierced through John at the contact. He was between suppressants. No longer able (allowed) to use the military-grade suppressants he had been on, he had to wait before swapping over to the generics from the chemists. He'd been careful, using special soaps aimed at hiding an Omega's scent, but with Sherlock this close, it was dangerous. Especially because he had no clue just how strong the Alpha's senses were.

With his own abilities repressed, John's sense of smell had been reduced to that of a beta. Normal, and dull, unable to smell Alphas or pick out their unique scents. It would come back, eventually, if he stopped his suppressants, but this had been his life for as long as he could remember.

Two things would happen if Sherlock found out.

One: He would be forced into a bond, simply because Sherlock's Alpha brain would kick in, and demand that the unbound omega finally belong to someone

Two: Sherlock would kick him out for legal reasons. Alphas were not supposed to lodge with unbound Omegas unless they were already bound, and for one reason or another, their bound mate couldn't produce children. Then, it was acceptable for an alpha to invite a second omega into their home, whose purpose would be to become a surrogate parent. (And quite often, more simply put a fuck toy.)

The thought of not being here, at baker street, made his heartache. In the months since moving in, he'd grown to enjoy the flat and the company.

""Morning, boys. Got your mail here."" Mrs. Hudson sets the mail on the table. ""Aren't you two the picture of domestic bliss?"" She coos as she sees them.

""John's proximity helps me think."" Sherlock mumbles, keeping up the ruse had been a bit of a struggle at first. But Sherlock had observed that John was settling into their arrangement which made things easier. He ignored how intoxicating it was to have John's fingers in his hair.

""You two are just so precious. Much nicer than Mrs. Turner's married ones I'll tell you."" Mrs. Hudson nods.

""Uhh, thanks?"" John says, wishing Sherlock's hair didn't feel oh so very soft beneath his fingers.

""Are her married ones... betas?"" He asks, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible. So far neither Sherlock or Mrs. Hudson had asked about his secondary biology, which had been a breath of fresh air, and he wondered if that was because he was in a mostly beta neighborhood.

Mrs. Hudson nods. ""Mrs. Turner says they're thinking of moving out. Want a bigger place to have a family. She says they keep her up all night, bed frame squeaking and all that."" She tsks. ""I'm so lucky you boys are so considerate. Barely heard a peep out of you. You know I take my herbal soothers in the evenings so don't let me be a hindrance."" She winks at John.

""Yes well, with the bedroom upstairs I imagine that helps keep things, erm, quiet."" John offers while willing his traitorous fingers to stop moving. But they don't, so he sighs and gives into it, at least for as long as their landlady is upstairs.

I should tell him that I'm an Omega. Before his prat of a brother finds out. I was promised it was all locked away, but who knows how high his clearance goes.

Instead, he clears his throat and pats Sherlock on the shoulder.

""Scootch,"" he says, trying to make his voice sound sympathetic like a lover might. ""Need the loo.""

Sherlock sighs dramatically but obliges, letting John up.

Mrs. Hudson chats with Sherlock about her next doctor's appointment while he tries to convince her to get the hip transplant.

John didn't actually have to use the loo. But he couldn't just sit there, petting Sherlock's hair and pretending to be madly in love. He'd noticed, while Mrs. Hudson had been drabbling on about the neighbours, that a faint scent of leather had reached his nose. His senses trying to come back online while in between brands of suppressants. Between the scent and the feeling of Sherlock's hair, he'd wanted to curl forward and bury his nose in the crook of Sherlock's neck. The Alpha smelled amazing, intoxicating even.

He wanted to lean forward and bury his nose in the hollow below Sherlock's adam's apple. He wanted to glide his nose along that sharp jawline, and those tempting freckles dusting across pale skin.

""Get a grip, Watson,"" he scolds himself, gripping the sink and staring at his reflection. His cheeks are pink, and heat prickles down his spine and between his legs. ""Good god, get a grip.""

Bending down he fishes around below the sink for his medical kit. Buried below all the gauze, bandages, and ointment is a disposable packet of a special deodorizer for Omegas. In itself, not rare to find in a medical kit. Should a doctor come across a wounded Omega, it would be commonplace for the doctor to use one of these wipes on the major scent glands before administering medical aid.

Pulling a single cloth out of the pack, he put everything away and quickly set about wiping himself down, focusing on his neck, armpits, and groin before flushing the cloth.

Just have to hope that doesn't clog... he thought, watching as the ancient toilet fought to suck the cloth down. But certainly, Sherlock has thrown worse down this old thing,

Sherlock was in the kitchen pouring some viscous liquid into the kettle when John came out, Mrs. Hudson had gone back downstairs. ""Mrs. Hudson asked if she should be expecting a happy announcement soon."" He rolls his eyes. ""I told her to hound you about it. You're better with relationship navigation anyway.""

""Great. Thanks..."" John sighs then stare at the kettle ""what are the chances that'll be safe for tea sometime this century?""

""It's dying anyway. This gives you an excuse to get that new one you've been eyeing at Tesco anyway."" Sherlock shrugs.

""So I guess I'll just go now, shall I?""

John sighs again, though honestly, the fresh air sounded good. He needed out of the flat, away from the confusing scents of Alpha. It was too early to retire to his bedroom, where he could throw a window open and air out the room. The last time He'd tried opening the windows in the sitting room (then he'd simply wanted to let in the fresh spring air) Sherlock had muttered something about dust, and promptly shut them again.

""Need anything? Might as well get a few things while I'm there, and if I'm bringing a kettle home, I'm getting a cab, rather than walking it.""

""Mm those chocolate biscuits. And tea. And honey, as many kinds as you can manage. Ask the butcher for organs from the bin as well."" Sherlock plugs in the kettle.

""I draw the line at organs,"" John grumbled as he grabbed his coat.

Only, once at the store, across from the butcher, he caved. The man, it seemed, was well aware of Sherlock and his habits and didn't hesitate in giving John a few bits and bobs.

""Pigs heart, random fowl innards, and a cow's eye,"" John announces once home. Sherlock is sitting in his chair, hands steepled under his nose deep in thought. John drops the wax paper bag on Sherlock's lap and takes the rest of the groceries into the kitchen.

He washes his hands, then puts the food away. At last turning to the kettle, he unboxes it, and gives it a good rinse, calling over the sound of the running water.

""This is for tea only, Sherlock. No experiments. Water, and tea. Understand?""

""Yes, yes fine."" Sherlock agrees as he looks through his goodie bag.

""You're welcome,"" John states, a bit dramatically though he isn't exactly sure why it was irking him that Sherlock hadn't thanked him. Or why he'd even caved and given into the Alpha's request in the first place.

He's an Alpha... And your body thinks it's about to have a heat. His brain warned, a part of him knowing that close proximity and coming down off medical-grade suppressants would be wreaking havoc with his hormones. I haven't had a proper heat in... Oh god, I can't even remember. Of course, my body is honing in on the first available Alpha it senses.

Sherlock takes the organs to the table and starts dissecting them.

""Takeaway?"" John asks, not even bothering to fight Sherlock for use of the kitchen. Not when he looks so much like a child on Christmas morning.

""I ordered Indian while you were out. Don't worry, I make sure to ask for extra naan."" Sherlock hums as he slices the heart open.

""Uh, thanks.""

""Is that what girlfriends do? Feed you up?""

No, you're looking into this too hard. He likes Indian food, he got it for himself and simply forgot to be selfish and not get me any.

""Right I'll just be.. upstairs, call me when it's here?""

Sherlock doesn't say anything, just continues scrutinizing samples under the microscope.

Risking Sherlock being too absorbed in his work to hear the doorbell, John heads up to his room where he promptly plops down on the bed, breathing in the scent of his bedding, willing the sweet scent of Sherlock to dissipate.

Three more days and I can stab myself with the new suppressant. Just have to make it through a few more days. Maybe Harry is free.

Sherlock gets the food when the delivery comes, pays the delivery man and bounds back to the kitchen. He places the bags on the counter then leans into the hall, calling up the stairs, ""John! Food!"" He waits, listening for John's footsteps, and frowns when there's no answer. ""John?"" He heads up to John's room, ""John, dinner is here."" He says, then notices that the bedroom door is cracked open.

The scents and sounds of London rush past John's ears. Petrol, ozone, pavement, scents from Speedy's... they all assault John's awakening senses. He'd forgotten it was like this, every scent seemed to come with a colour, every scent seeming to linger in his nostrils for hours after logic told him they'd long faded.

He focused on the scents from Speedy's, picking apart the various smoked meats he used in his sandwiches. Until a noise behind him made him pull his head in from the window and spin around.

""Dinner,"" Sherlock says simply as if finding his flatmate hanging out of a second-story window was completely normal.

Purple, his scent is purple. John realized, as the proximity once again brought Sherlock's scent front and center.

""Erm, yeah, be right down.""

Sherlock looks John over for a moment longer before turning and heading back downstairs, the gears in his mind turning.

I should take up smoking, or fake it. That way it appears I have a reason to hang out the window. John chides himself, taking his last breath of fresh air before heading back into the thick of it all.

Thankfully for John, Indian food was not known for subtle scents. Curry half-drowned out the natural scents of the flat, making it tolerable for John to sit across the table from the Alpha.Sherlock has ordered a butter curry, aromas of ginger and coconut rise up and make his mouth water. They divvy out the food, John taking a bit more Naan, and Sherlock extra rice.

""God, I'm starved.""

""I'm sure. You hardly touched your lunch today."" Sherlock hums as he eats, rarely eating himself but always noticing patterns about John. ""I hope it's to your liking."" He says, having picked John's favorites.

""Yeah well, after I learned you'd spilled acid on the table, the thought of eating my sandwich, which I'd prepared on the table, suddenly wasn't very appealing"" Instead of being angry, John laughs. Of all things to be worried about, accidentally ingesting acid was at the very least, interesting.

""I cleaned it up. You're just paranoid."" Sherlock shrugs but he's smiling. ""Mrs. Hudson still won't listen to me about the hip replacement. Will you talk to her? You're a doctor after all.""

""Surgery isn't easy, Sherlock. She'll get it when she's ready, and not a moment before. But, I can suggest a few friends in the field."" John adds, catching the faint smile on Sherlock's face. ""Best she can do is arm herself with knowledge, and make sure it's right for her.""

""It's a good thing we have a resident medical man then,"" Sherlock smirks.

Sherlock is halfway through his plate when his phone starts ringing. He gets up and answers. ""How many? Where?"" He asks, Lestrade calling with a new case.

Knowing that look, and those words, John devours the rest of his meal. When Sherlock was on a case, John was lucky to be given five minutes for a meal, and by how many he assumed there were multiple bodies, which meant Sherlock would want to be there five minutes ago.

""Excellent. We're on the way."" Sherlock hangs up and grabs his coat. ""John, case.""

""Sherlock, curry,"" John says, dipping the naan into the buttery sauce. ""You can wait five minutes for me to finish my meal.""

""Six bodies, John. And an Omega going into heat. Bring your kit."" Sherlock heads downstairs to get them a cab.

""Bloody hell...."" John mutters, wondering just how badly the cabbie would hate him if he brought the curry with him.

Instead, he hastily throws the covers back on the takeaway containers, pops everything into the fridge, hoping there wouldn't be any cross-contamination with Sherlock's organs, and dashes upstairs for his kit.

He exits the flat just in time to see Sherlock vanish into the back of a cab, and hurries forward to join him. The driver is Alpha, which is not uncommon. But between the two of them, in such close quarters, John begins to wonder if there won't be two Omega's going into heat at the crime scene.

John looks over in surprise when Sherlock unrolls the cab window once they start to move through the city. Once at the crime scene, Sherlock tosses the fare at the cabbie and gets out, heading right into the middle of the crime scene with quick strides. He holds up the police tape for John as he takes in the scene.

A small female omega was trembling with a blanket on and officers talking to her. Men and women, Alphas and betas, though Sherlock notices with annoyance that the team tonight is mostly Alphas.

""All unbound Alphas off this scene immediately!"" Sherlock snarls, grabbing Alphas one by one and dragging them off himself when they don't comply. ""John, tend to the woman. Please."" He says, seeing her covered in blood, though it doesn't appear to be her own blood.

John stands still, shocked at seeing Sherlock's full Alpha side unleashed. It rooted him in his spot until Sherlock gave him an order. He's amazed at how many Alphas simply listened to him, only a few lingered long enough for Sherlock to tear them away from the poor girl.

Why? Why does Sherlock want to be alone with her?

John, tend to the woman.

""Uh, yeah... yeah.""

Tightening the grip on his kit he hurries forward, getting as close to the Omega as he could, while still respecting her privacy. Glancing over his shoulder he sees Sherlock dragging the last officer away from the woman, and knows they're mostly out of earshot.

""Hi, I'm Doctor Watson... I'm, well, not a beta, or Alpha..."" He offers softly, watching as she looks up and tries to piece together his confession. It takes her a second, but the realization washes some of the fear from her features. John holds up a single finger to his lips, begging her to keep his secret, then crouches low.

""Are you hurt?"" He asks, still keeping his distance.

She shakes her head, confirming his initial suspicion. ""Did you fall?"" He asked, wondering if she'd been pushed into a puddle of blood. She nods once, but then amends it, shaking her head. Confused, possibly concussed.

""Can I come a bit closer?"" John asks, giving her a friendly smile. She hesitates for a moment before nodding again.

Sherlock makes sure Lestrade kicks the Alphas out before going back to the scene. He makes sure to keep his distance, not wanting to scare the poor woman anymore. He grabs a scent blocker out of one of the police kits. He rips open the package and slaps the patch on his neck. He gives it a few minutes to work before going to have a look at the scene. Six dead alphas, all executed.

Professional.

Sherlock goes back to John and the woman. ""Can you tell us what happened?"" He asks softly, making himself look as small and non-threatening as possible.

""You're fine, this close?"" John asks without looking at Sherlock.

Sherlock shoots him a look that says ""don't be stupid"" then promptly ignores him in favor of listening to the young Omega speak. Her words are broken and don't make much sense so they both wait politely until a team of paramedics arrives, then John pulls Sherlock aside.

""Are you bound? Is there an Omega in your life I need to know about? Because if not, getting that close to her could have been incredibly dangerous! Last thing I need to see is my friend on top of some Omega who's already gone through hell.""

""No I'm not bound. And I have a very good idea of what she's gone through. My body is a transport for my mind. It doesn't rule over me. I rule over it. She needed to feel safe and protected. You did that. You cleaned her up. I protected her from the other Alphas. She gave information that is vital that wouldn't have been without that secure feeling. Besides this bloody patch worked."" Sherlock rips the patch off his neck, a small rash on his neck from where it was.

""I don't care if she was an Omega or beta or Alpha. She was a victim and I will not let her be victimized further or let a murderer go free. I don't care about secondary biology other than if it's a motive for a case or not. Beyond that, it's all background noise.""

""Well, that was still dumb."" John hisses, unable to let go of his anger. He'd been warned that his body would attempt a heat between switching brands of suppressants, but he hadn't realized just how emotional it was making him. He kept just thinking That could be me, ready to go into heat, scared, trapped with an Alpha.

""Next time, warn me you have the bloody patch on, couldn't see it under your collar and scarf.""

John bites his lip then realizes he's still gripping Sherlock's elbow. He drops it, and steps back then motions to the bodies as if willing Sherlock to be anywhere but by his side where his scent and act of protectiveness were making his body beg him to skip the next dose.

""I apologize.."" Sherlock frowns, not liking seeing John so affected. ""You should go home and finish eating. I'm going to go to Bart's and handle the bodies with Molly. I'll probably be gone all night.""

John opens his mouth, about to cus Sherlock out for suggesting John go home. But his gut wrenches, and it has nothing to do with the carnage surrounding them.

Fuck

He begins to think. The flat is too far away to walk to, and being trapped in a taxi with an unknown Alpha wasn't ideal right now.

""I'll... come with you to Bart's, then make my way home from there,"" he says, hoping Sherlock wouldn't object.

Sherlock looks John over but doesn't say anything, only nodding and leading John to the body transport van.

They sit in silence. Sherlock thinking about whatever it was Sherlock Holmes thought about. While John considered dead bodies to be a step up from unknown Alphas who had the power to drive him anywhere, against his will or not.

He felt better, away from the chaos and blood. As his blood pressure went down, so did the symptoms he'd long since forgotten. By the time they made it back to the heart of the city, he almost felt normal, aside from his heightened sense of smell, and decided to at least stop and say hello to Molly.

Sherlock keeps an eye on John, wondering why he's smelling different. Perhaps it was his anger or the worry over the Omega. Could even be the dead Alphas affecting him. He follows John inside Bart's as the bodies are taken to the morgue for processing. ""We should get a treat for Molly from the cafe so she'll let us stay for the autopsies.""

""I'll go... cake? Cupcake?"" John asks, remembering there was a bakery just down the street. Sugar would help him, or at the very least it would satiate his emotions if only a little.

""Good. She likes the red velvet."" Sherlock nods. ""Get yourself something as well. We may be here for a while."" He pulls out a wad of bills from his pocket and hands them over to John before going down to the morgue.

""We?"" John asks himself. ""Not trying to get rid of me now.. why?""

He ends up buying three red velvet cupcakes, and a dozen chocolate-covered strawberries, knowing that even Sherlock wouldn't be able to resist at least one of the sugary fruits. He tucks the box under his arm and heads back into the hospital, feet carrying him through once familiar halls until he's in the morgue. Where the grandeur of the sweets is slightly lost among the stainless steel slabs, and the bodies laid out on them.

He places the parcel down on a table as far away from the bodies as he can, and leans against the wall, waiting for Sherlock and Molly to notice he'd arrived. However, the two were in a deep discussion, carried out in hushed tones, and so far neither seemed to know another living soul was around.

""Their scent glands are gone, Sherlock."" Molly mumbles.

""I can see that. Was it professional or sloppy?"" Sherlock asks as he looks with her.

""Professional..."" John sighs, having gotten near enough to hear.

""I've seen something like this before, and it isn't pretty.""

He pinches the bridge of his nose, sucking in a deep breath to keep his emotions stable. He didn't need another spike of his biology crippling him just because he got worked up.

""In Afghanistan, some insurgents had the brilliant idea that doubling their scent glands would double their strength. Think... when a barbarian goes into its berserk state in a video game or movie. We put an end to it before they had a chance to experiment, but they can't have been the only ones to have that idea.""

""Of all the superstitious pseudoscience."" Sherlock shakes his head.

""Are you alright, John? You look a bit flush."" Molly says quietly.

""Mm? Oh yeah, fine."" John waves Molly off, not even bothering to think of an excuse. ""Going to be here a while? If so, I might head home. Maybe have the flat to myself a bit, watch crap telly without Sherlock deducing it on me.""

""If you remember anything else from what you've seen of this before, text me,"" Sherlock says, pulling on gloves before touching the bodies.

 

""Oh cupcakes."" Molly smiles and goes to the box.

""I'll reach out to a friend, he dealt with most of it. If there's anything we're allowed to share I'll let you know."" John says, smiling at Molly, and remembering his cupcake before heading out.

""Maybe a bubble bath, but I'd have to scrub the tub first. That sounds nice... and some wine? And of course, this cupcake.""

""A nice relaxing evening."" Molly smiles and picks up her cupcake, taking a bite while Sherlock scoures the bodies.

Feeling a bit guilty for leaving Sherlock, John reminds himself that all he'd do, should he stay, was sit and wait. Per policy, he wouldn't be allowed to help, just like Sherlock technically wasn't allowed to help.

By chance or cosmic design, he flags down London's only Beta cab driver and makes it hope without any more spikes.

""I can feel you staring, Molly,"" Sherlock says as he takes samples from under the fingernails.

""Nothing just..."" she titters, ""he brought you chocolate. You can't tell me you didn't notice how flushed he was. If ever there was a time to bond, well, it would be soon. Sherlock. He'll be needing it. And, well, you tolerate him, as much as you do anyone else. More so even.""

Sherlock frowns and glares at Molly. ""What are you talking about?""

""Wine... bubble bath, crap telly. He's nesting. Honestly, for a genius, you're not always very bright. What else does he need to do, hang a neon sign over his head saying I'm going into heat soon, and would like to go home and be comforted by my Alpha because that's silly? Sherlock, very silly, they don't make those signs."" Molly says, shooting her friend a scathing look over one of the dead Alphas.

""Really, you Alphas act like you're the ones in charge when really, we hold all the power because you lot are too dumb to understand.""

Sherlock just blinks. ""I.."" he looks at the bodies. ""Call me when the preliminary results come in."" He whips off the gloves and grabs his coat, heading out the door.

""Yeah, no... I'll text. Don't need you answering the phone during that..."" Molly quips.

John's heat makes a surprise appearance...

Hey, Tindo here! Accident is asleep ;) Maybe some of you lovely people can surprise them with a comment or two for when they wake up?


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Alone in the flat, John breathes in a sigh of relief, though the feeling of relief doesn't last long.

Surrounded by the scents of home and Sherlock, his stomach twists and he can feel a once familiar dampness between his cheeks.

""Fuck."" he hissed, pulling his mobile out of his pocket he dials his contact on the local army base.

He paces for the ten minutes it takes to be connected, then growls into the phone. ""You miss calculated. It's starting, and I need something now not in three days. Fix this, I've had enough unfulfilled heats to last a lifetime, you were supposed to ensure I'd pass as a beta.""

His contact mutters something, and papers are shuffled about, then he's being offered a safe house for the duration, rather than the suppressants he needs now, not in three days. But he knows it's already too late, he's already past the point where medical intervention could help.

He's about to accept the safe house when the floorboards in the hall creak. He turns around and sees Sherlock standing wide-eyed in the doorway.

""There's always something.."" Sherlock says softly, looking John over. He makes sure to stand outside the door to the flat. ""Text me what you need and I'll make sure it's made available to you. I'll stay down in 221C and make sure no one comes in the flat to get you."" He gives John one last look before turning to go.

John ignores the man on the other end of the phone call and stares at Sherlock like a rabbit caught in the headlights for a moment before snapping back to attention

""Don't... go. I just want to take a bubble bath, drink some wine, eat my cupcakes and maybe have my hair stroked for once"" he blurts out before Sherlock can leave. ""Plus,"" he adds quietly, ""we're supposed to be pretending to be a couple, you staying downstairs isn't going to help that. One word and my CO can have me in a safe house for the duration. You can tell people my sister needed me, then we'll get this squared away... So it won't happen again. Unless... You don't want me back.""

The man on the other end of the line sighs impatiently, but John snaps at him, telling him he can wait a few goddamned seconds. He looks over at Sherlock, trying to judge if he'll still have a home in a few days.

""John, this is your home. You should feel safe and welcome here. Whatever you want or need all you have to do is ask and I'll make sure it happens."" Sherlock nods. ""You are indispensable to the Work and to me. You are free to leave any time you want but I will never force you out."" He says softly. He feels awkward and nervous. He doesn't want to upset John or cross any lines.

""I can go start the bath if you'd like?"" Sherlock offers, trying to show John that he'll do anything he can to help him.

John nods once at Sherlock, a small thankful smile playing on his lips. Thinking fast he addresses the man on the other end of the phone call. Ignoring his impatient growl.

""I'm staying home where a friend can protect me. However, you will drop off a vial of heat reducer, which you will hand to anyone who answers the door."" John hangs up, not giving the man time to argue or come up with a less pleasant option for him.

He hears water coming from the bathroom and snaps back to attention. Dashing up the stairs he grabs his most comfortable pair of pyjamas then heads back downstairs where true enough Sherlock is bent over the tub. John lingers in the doorframe, cupcake in one hand, pyjamas in the other.

""This wasn't supposed to happen. I'm in between brands... I think being so close to that omega set me off. Seeing her stress... Sorry... I'm sure you weren't looking for an Omega to flatshare with,"" he mumbles, trying to breach the awkwardness that had come between them.

 

""You don't have to explain anything to me, John. Technically I wasn't looking to flatshare with anyone but Mrs. Hudson needs someone to look out for her and this was her stipulation. If anything, being here helps both her and I a tremendous amount."" Sherlock shrugs as he adds fancy bath salts to the water as well as bubble bath.

""I.."" Sherlock stands and looks at John. ""Living with an Alpha, especially one as difficult to live with as myself, must be hard for you. I want to apologize if I ever made you afraid or fearful as such was never my intention.""

""Yeah..."" John starts to say, but stops and tilts his head. ""You... never made me feel afraid. Half the time, I think you forget you're an Alpha.""

""Gender itself is a construct and secondary gender is like a biological hostage situation. I try to ignore it as much as possible."" Sherlock huffs a small laugh. ""Check the temperature of the bath and I'll go open the wine? Red or white?""

""Biological hostage situation..."" John scoffs, stepping into the room and brushing past Sherlock to dip his finger into the water. ""Never before has a more apt phrase been uttered. I've spent my whole life trying to avoid my heats. Mm waters nice, and.. red? please?""

Without thinking about social expectations, or what would be considered proper, John strips and slips into the water while Sherlock is off getting the wine. He doesn't care when Sherlock enters the room and finds him mostly buried under a layer of bubbles, all he cares about is the relief the warm water has to offer.

Sherlock nods and goes to the kitchen, opening a fresh bottle and pouring some for John. ""Here."" He passes the wine to John. ""Is there anything else I can do or get you? Or I could leave you alone?"" He asks, never having had to take care of someone in heat before.

""Someone, probably in full military kit, carrying a metal ammo box, will be bringing over a vial of reducer for me. It should make it so at the most, I'm itchy and irritable over the next few days. If possible... just no smelly experiments until this is over?""

John wrinkles his nose at the thought of the reducer but doesn't voice his concerns about the medicine. It isn't ideal, but it's better than being in the throes of sexual desire for the next 78 hours.

""From an outsider's perspective, it'll appear we've swapped roles for a time. Me being the grumpy arsehole in the middle of an epic temper tantrum, while you play the role of 'its time to eat, John, you should bathe, John. John, why don't you change your clothes, you've been in the same pants for two days.' ""

Sherlock chuckles softly and nods. ""I suppose I can play nanny for a few days."" He teases. ""What does it feel like? To be in heat?""

John sits up a bit and reaches for the wine, then changes his mind and grabs the cupcake instead.

""It's a bit like,"" he says around a bite, sending crumbs into the water. ""Watching a really bad porno, where you just can't look away no matter how badly you want to. Like feeling every cell in your body turn to lava for days on end unless sexual gratification is met. It's always been bad for me, I was told they'd get easier once I was an adult... but.."" He shrugs and meets Sherlock's gaze, unaware of just how weird it was to be having this conversation naked, in a tub, with an Alpha looming over him. ""Too many years suppressing it, I guess, kind of ruined it for myself.""

""That doesn't sound pleasant at all."" Sherlock leans against the sink. ""Does spending a heat with a partner help?""

""Don't know. Never have."" John says around another mouthful of confectionary heaven. ""Threat of an unwanted bond, when my body literally can't say no. Doesn't sound pleasant to me. I'm more than my biology, more than a man capable of bearing children. I refuse to let some sod bond me and stick me at home to raise his.. or her... pups.""

Cupcake gone, John sinks back down into the water, letting the wine sit for another moment.

""I should warn you, me living here... guess it could put you in trouble. I'm registered as an Omega, of course. But the military made a few exceptions and had all that buried. Still, you being an Alpha... you'd have to sign ownership of me.""

Sherlock scowls. ""I don't want ownership of you. If anything you're the more reliable and more stable one in this flat. You should have ownership over me if anyone was to own anyone."" He rolls his eyes and sits on the floor, his back leaning against the tub.

""You are your own person. A highly skilled doctor and a veteran. You shouldn't have to struggle for personhood like this. It's archaic and deplorable. The only thing that comes out of it is abuse and unhealthy relationships. My mother knocked my father up. They were dating sure but they hadn't even discussed marriage. Then Mycroft was born so of course, they had to do the right thing and bond."" He makes a gagging noise.

Sherlock sighs and leans his head back against the edge of the tub. ""I'll do whatever I can to make things easier for you but I will not do anything legally binding without your full knowledge and consent."" He turns his head to look at John.

""Pass me a flannel?"" John asks after a long stretch of silence.

Part of him knows this should be weird, having Sherlock so close. However, he can't deny that Sherlock's company, in itself, is comforting.

""Dad's an omega then..."" he muses, accepting the flannel and dipping it into the water before wringing it out and placing it over his face. Humid warmth washes over him and he lets out a happy sigh.

""Not many of us out there, at least not out in the open. It's harder nowadays when the world has a picture-perfect idea of what masculinity should look like, and bearing children isn't part of that picture.""

""My father came from a poor family. They were basically destitute but he was an omega so he could have his pick of whatever suitor he wanted. My mother is from a wealthy family and she's a mathematician. Quite brilliant in fact, her work has changed quite a few fields."" Sherlock relaxes, the humidity of the bathroom and John's scent calming.

""Father was a photographer. He took some of the most breathtaking photos I've ever seen. Then after having Mycroft he became allergic to the chemicals used in the developing process. I don't think he ever really forgave mother for getting him pregnant. Especially after he wouldn't develop his own work anymore."" He frowns.

""Mm biological changes after a male Omega's pregnancy are not uncommon. Your whole body changes, the testosterone you naturally make all but vanishes during pregnancy. I can't imagine it was easy.""

The flannel has gone cold, so John drags it off of his face and reaches for the wine.

""My mum was the Omega, so it was a bit easier on her. Harry lucked out, got the Alpha trait while I'm stuck like this every few months. It was half the reason I joined the military. The suppressants they have are far superior to anything you can get at the local chemist. They rendered me identical to a beta male. Only clues would have been my own physical appearance, not that I let anyone see.""

Warm and comfortable, John lets out a small sigh. The tightness in his body is no longer clawing at his every nerve. ""The case then? Do you know who did it?""

""I have an idea but I need more data first. The Alphas had surrounded that woman because they smelled her heat. Someone took them out. The interesting part is the scent gland removal."" Sherlock hums, eyes closed.

""Mm, well if anyone can figure this out, you can.""

John sipped his wine and was silent for a long moment. That could have been him surrounded by Alphas, it had been once. He knew the fear she must have been feeling.

""Glad she's safe.""

""As am, I."" Sherlock hums. He could tell that John's scent was becoming more pronounced but it didn't bother him in the way most Alphas seem to be bothered. If anything it allowed him to categorize all of John's smells. He wanted to know everything about John.

""I'm going to... Erm, finish up here."" John said after a moment. ""Someone should be by soon. I should be able to manage the injection on my own, but I'd rather not open the door myself. Would you mind answering?"" Finding himself wanting to stare at the back of Sherlock's neck, he warms the flannel and places it back over his eyes.

""Of course."" Sherlock nods and gets up, his long limbs stretching him off the floor. ""Is there anything else I can order you that you may need? Certain food? Entertainment? Toys?""

John laughs out loud at that. Simply thinking about Sherlock walking into an adult shop and buying the largest Alpha cock dildo the store has to offer almost makes this whole ordeal worth it.

""No. If the reducer will take away the worst of those urges. Thank God. I might be a bit more munchy, but mainly out of boredom than anything. Snacks could be good. But don't go out of your way.""

Sherlock tips his head as if confused. ""What was so funny?""

""You buying me a dildo.""

John begins to laugh again, then with a wave of his hand says, ""what are friends for, if they can't help you shove a synthetic cock up your own arse.""

""I've bought a dildo before, John. It's not a very complicated process."" Sherlock rocks back and forth from his heels to the balls of his feet. ""And if it could help you I wouldn't think twice about it.""

""Yeah, but buying one for yourself is one thing. It's not exactly the most common gift."" John peels back the flannel and grins up at Sherlock. The doorbell rings before either of them get a chance to say anything else and Sherlock excuses himself to answer the door.

""Well, when I woke up this morning I didn't think I'd be soaking in a bubble bath with an Alpha sitting beside me."" John mutters to himself as he clambers out of the tub and towels off.

Sherlock answers the door seeing a man standing there just as John had described. ""The medication?"" He holds his hand out.

John is dressed in his cotton pyjamas and is walking out of the bathroom by the time Sherlock comes back upstairs. He rolls his eyes at the armoured box containing the single vial and motions towards the table. Sherlock sets it down and watches as he opens the box.

""Will it be an issue, watching me? Triggers an all that,"" he asks, pulling out a hyperdynamic needle. He rips the packaging off of it and wastes no time in piercing the cap on the vial.

Sherlock shakes his head. ""Haven't had cravings in a while."" He rips open the alcohol wipe packet and holds it out to John.

""Right, just making sure.""

Thanks to the warmth from the tub he finds a vein easily. After cleaning the skin with the wipe he injects the yellowish liquid into his system then purses his lips.

""Do me a favour, watch me for the next twenty minutes. I haven't had this yet, so don't know if I'm allergic. Keep an eye out for cognitive slips, hives, or shortness of breath."" Slipping the needle out of his body he paces the cap over the sharp end and tossed into the bin.

""I'll make tea,"" Sherlock says and goes to the kettle. Once he has it filled and turned on he pulls out his phone, fingers flying over the keyboard.

John half wants to ask if Molly has texted yet. The case would distract him from the ache of desire and longing to be pressed up against an Alpha, strong arms holding him close while he buries his nose into dark curls.

Fuck. Not any Alpha. He starts, realizing that the faceless alpha in his fantasy wasn't as faceless as it had once been. Now Sherlock's elegant curves replaced the once blocky shape, pale skin and sharp eyes replaced the once fuzzy face.

""I'm... Going to curl up on the sofa."" John mutters, shuffling past the Alpha he now shared a flat with. ""One sugar, please. I crave sweet things when I'm like this.""

""Mm."" Sherlock hums and nods, not looking up from his phone. When the tea is ready he makes it and brings John his mug as well as a package of biscuits he knows John secretly likes when he's not feeling well.

""No signs of allergic reaction yet, the worst would have kicked in by now."" John says, watching Sherlock's fingers fly across the front of his phone. ""case stuff? Do you need to leave?""

""Mm? No. Placing an order."" Sherlock says as he looks at the list of items. ""Do you prefer milk or dark chocolate?""

""What?"" John lifts his head and glances over at Sherlock in puzzlement.

""Dark or milk chocolate. I've seen you enjoy both. I'll get both."" Sherlock hums, sipping his tea as he adds more things to the order.

""You're being nice to me..."" John says when half his tea is gone. He can't recall the last time Sherlock was voluntarily nice to anyone. Even when buttering up a client, the act slipped the instant it was no longer needed. Yet, something told John this wasn't an act. ""Why?""

Sherlock squirms a bit, looking uncomfortable. ""I want you to stay here at Baker Street. Most people can't stand being around me longer than absolutely necessary and yet you live here by your own volition. You're indispensable to the Work and to me. And I'd rather have you comfortable and safe with me than out there. Alphas are disgusting horrendous creatures. If I could be anything else I would."" He looks at John.

John sighs and props his back up against the arm of the sofa, stretching his feet out over the cushions.

""I was afraid you'd ask me to leave, if you found out. I've been careful, soaps, and scent neutralizer clothes. I think seeing that Omega in stress set me over the edge. I was worried that if I accepted their offer of a safe house, I'd come back to find you gone, or my things on the pavement.""

""Never, John. This is your home just as much as mine."" Sherlock promises.

""Pass me the blanket from my chair?"" John asks, curling up on his side with his back against the cushions.

The contents of the vial were making him drowsy.

""Just.. going to nap a bit.""

Sherlock gets the blanket and lays it out over John. ""I'll be here if you need anything.""

""Ta,"" John mumbles moments before slipping off to sleep.

Dreams during a heat were typically far more vivid than normal dreams. John imagined they were meant to make the omega wake up already gagging for it. But instead of the faceless Alphas hovering around him as per normal, he dreamt of Sherlock sitting by his head, running those long fingers through his sandy hair.

Sherlock watches John sleep for a bit before sitting on the edge of the couch, gently threading his fingers through John's hair. John had mentioned that this would help so he thought he'd try it. He places the order that should arrive by the time John woke up.

John is a whore for bubble baths, what can I say?

Sherlock finds some ways to help John with his heat..

The sitting room is empty when John wakes, but a soft rustling of bags from the kitchen tells John he's not alone.

Focusing on his body he's pleased to find that, while still sensitive and desperately longing for a good solid hug, his heat hasn't progressed any further.

He yawns and stretches, finding a pillow had been placed under his head while he slept.

""Oh good, you're awake. Put this together."" Sherlock brings John a box with a collapsible projector screen inside.

""Uhhh..."" John mutters, running a hand through his strangely disheveled hair.

Sherlock doesn't give him time to think about it. He simply thrusts the object against his chest, leaving it to John to make sure it doesn't clatter to the floor.

He sits at the table, staring at the mess while trying to figure out how to put the box together.

""Did you buy out Gregg's?

""Hardly, John. They just have a larger selection on the website."" Sherlock hums as he dumps out bags of snacks. He puts them away where they go and then starts working on the larger bags. He puts away the bathroom supplies, bath bombs and bubble bath.

""No one has ever done this for me before,"" John says softly, watching as Sherlock moves about.

""I... Thanks...""

Sherlock nods stiffly. ""I... I was sent to an alpha and beta boys boarding school when I was a child. I presented late which they teased me mercilessly for. One day another boy who they thought was a beta went into heat. He just so happened to be assigned my partner for a project. We were in the library and he was sweating and trembling. Then they came.. I held them off for as long as I could until the professors could arrive. I was sent to the hospital with a concussion and multiple fractures but they didn't lay one finger on him.""

""Uh.. wow."" John says, thinking back to his first heat and how terrifying it had been.

""He was lucky to have someone watching out for him. Not everyone is so lucky. And in a mixed school, god...""

""I was suspended for fighting. The others were let off with a warning because they were following their instincts. I was a freak who didn't want to rape my helpless classmate."" Sherlock shakes his head.

""Yeah well, it's not legally classified as rape, now is it..."" John says bitterly, ""It's our own damn fault for being out in public like that. Here... I think this is done?"" He holds up the box for Sherlock's inspection.

""But that's what it is. I don't care what name it has."" Sherlock takes the box and pulls the handle and the projector screen rolls perfectly. ""Excellent."" He takes it out to the living room and stands it up, unrolling the screen. He goes back to the table and unboxes a mini projector.

""Did you get popcorn?"" John asks, trying not to sound too hopeful as the pieces began to fit together. It was a pain moving their tiny tv so they could both sit comfortably on the sofa.

Clearly, Sherlock had some sort of movie night planned, though his idea of entertainment was usually a documentary on ash, which to him was something along the lines of a comedy.

""Obviously, John. What kind of heathen do you take me for?"" Sherlock scoffs as he pulls out an air popcorn popper from another bag. ""There's also an assortment of flavorings from sweet to savory to once that I find strange to put on popcorn."" He hands John the box of flavorings before taking the popper out of the box.

""Mmmm sweet for me""

John isn't quite sure where to place the box, so he placed it on the coffee table, then on a whim climbs the stairs to his room and comes back with half his bedding in tow.

""Should we warn Mrs. Hudson? Though the more I think about it the more I imagine she'd be thrilled to learn I'm an Omega.."" John says, claiming half the sofa as his with his various pillows and blankets then climbing into his makeshift nest.

""I told her that you weren't feeling well and not to come up so she doesn't catch anything. It is your information to give if you wish to do so."" Sherlock plugs in the projector and hands John a new weighted blanket while it turns on.

""Ta,"" John says to both Sherlock's words and the blanket. He replaced one of his thinner blankets with the new one, sighing as the weight settles around him

""Oh, this is heaven.""

""Good."" Sherlock smiles, he had done research on how to help an omega through their heat without sex. ""There is also a new heating pad should you need it. The last one caught fire."" He hums, not admitting he was the reason it had gone up.

""Very flammable, those heating pads,"" John grins, curling up into a tight little ball. ""So which documentary are we watching today?""

""No documentary today. I was thinking something more to your liking."" Sherlock hooks up the Bluetooth from his laptop to the projector. On the screen appears the title page of a Bond movie.

""Oh!""

With the popcorn ready they each fix themselves a bowl, John option for a sweeter flavour while Sherlock goes for something a bit more normal.

""Thanks,"" he says again as the opening song begins to play.

""Not a problem."" Sherlock hums as he munches on a handful of popcorn.

John makes it through half the movie before his eyes begin to get heavy from a mixture of the medicine, comfort, and a full stomach.

Propped up on a stack of pillows he begins to doze off waking every few minutes, or when the action gets too loud.

Eventually, the volume doesn't matter. Without thinking about *who* was beside him. He gave in to the basic desire of human connection. Pushing all but one of his pillows aside he plants the final pillow square on Sherlock's lap then curls up with the back of his head pressed against Sherlock's stomach.

Sherlock stills, letting John do as he pleases. He gently pets John's hair and lowers the volume of the movie.

The credits have long since ended, the screen black when John finally wakes up.

It takes him a moment to remember that the reason the surface below his head is warm is because it is Sherlock's lap, not his bed.

He sits up and finds Sherlock silently watching him.

Instead of mentioning the obvious, his falling asleep on an Alpha, he sleepily asks, ""Anything from Molly?""

""The alphas samples came back and they were all dosed with a slow-acting paralytic."" Sherlock hums. ""I'm starting to think they may have been lured to that alley.""

""Lured that close to an Omega in heat..."" John hisses, ""was she a plant... Or?""

""I don't think she was involved with whatever scheme was going on. She may have just been a convenient coincidence. Her terror and fear were genuine.""

""Check my phone, see if my contact got back to me on his findings in Afghanistan, if you haven't already,"" John says around a yawn. 'I need the loo.""

Sherlock nods and gets John's phone, looking for messages.

John finds Sherlock engrossed in what he assumed to be the email and curled back up on the sofa.

""Let me guess it's a photocopy of a report and almost all the words are redacted.""

Sherlock frowns and nods. ""Redactions never make sense to me. Knowledge is knowledge. It's just a hindrance to the truth."" He hands John back his phone before getting his laptop. He logs into the MET server using Lestrade's login so he can search for similar cases of scent glands being removed.

""Maybe your brother can get the original copy?"" John offers around another yawn.

""Think I'll turn in. Erm. Thanks for the movie night, and the snacks. And the bath, ""

It takes him a moment but he gathers up his bedding and heads for the stairs.

""Oh, I read that having familiar scents helps. Would you like some of my clothing?"" Sherlock asks, looking up from his laptop.

""Ummm....""

John stops at the door and tenses for a fraction of a second. Sleeping with Sherlock's clothing hadn't been even in the far reached of the back of his mind. But now presented with the offer, he found he didn't want to refuse.

""Would you mind?"" He said carefully.

""Of course not."" Sherlock nods as he stands and starts to unbutton his shirt.

""Oh. I thought you'd get a new sh... That works too."" John stammers watching as each undone button revealed a bit more of Sherlock's skin.

He found himself contemplating what it would be like to nuzzle along Sherlock's chest when he felt the familiar clench in his stomach.

Sherlock passes John the shirt, he has some scarring from failed experiments and fights, silvery scars over his pale skin.

""That must have required stitches..."" Shuffling the shirt, and the pile of bedding into one arm John reaches out and runs a finger along a scar just across the left of Sherlock's chest.

""Mm pocket life."" Sherlock nods, relaxing under John's touch.

""Yours or... Oh.. the Omega in the library,"" John guesses while wondering how it's possible that such a simple point of contact could feel as good as it felt to be touching Sherlock.

""That's right,"" Sherlock says softly, gently taking a step closer. He lists what different scars are from. He pushes his hair to the side, a scar on his scalp. ""Had to have a hole drilled to ease pressure on my brain.""

The close proximity is making John's head spin. Both physically and mentally.

""I had a suspicion that you are human..."" He murmurs, ""but this is proof. What's this one from?"" John traces the small scar at the corner of Sherlock's lips, a feature that instead of hindering Sherlock looks added.

""Another junky head-butted me when his stash went missing. He thought I stole it but he'd used it up."" Sherlock mumbles against John's fingers.

John lets his finger drop, worried that if he didn't his stomach would clench with desire again.

""I've just got the one really, and an appendix scar. I mean a few odds and ends here and there, but nothing as heroic as some of yours.""

""Most of them are stupid accidents."" Sherlock shrugs.

""They usually are... Right. well... "" John nods towards the stairs then catches a pillow before it slips to the floor ""goodnight, Sherlock.""

""Goodnight, John."" Sherlock nods and goes back to his laptop.

Up in his room, John hastily makes his bed then plops down, face first, nose buried into the soft fabric of Sherlock's shirt.

""It's just your bloody heat talking. Get a grip. He doesn't like you, not like that.""

Sherlock spends the night working on the case.


John wakes up the next morning with Sherlock's shirt held closely to the side of his face. He's pleased to find his heat hadn't progressed over the night, but annoyed to find he was still on the verge of wanting a wank followed by a bottle of wine, then another wank. He slides his hand down to the waistband of his pyjamas but stops short of touching himself. It doesn't feel right, masturbating with Sherlock's scent cloying at his nostrils. Surley there was a line that shouldn't be crossed about fantasising over your flatmate, even if he were an Alpha. 



Sherlock is downstairs making breakfast, a full spread for John to enjoy. He had done more research on Omega's overnight in-between casework. Through such research, he'd learned that nesting usually came hand in hand with comfort eating.



""John!"" Sherlock calls up. ""Breakfast is almost ready.""



John's hand slides out of his waistband with a snap of elastic. He groans and sits up. Half wanting to remain curled up under his pile of blankets, while the rest of him wanted to find out what Sherlock considers breakfast to be. The growling in his stomach wins, and without changing into fresh pyjamas, he heads downstairs. Leaving Sherlock's shirt spread out on top of his pillow.



Sherlock has all of John's favorites on the table. ""Research says that heats can lead to increased appetite.""



""Mmm, did you sleep, or did you spend up all night researching Omegas?"" John says sleepily, slumping down into a chair and wincing when his extra sensitive rear end hits the hard surface. John tucks in, and despite his grumbling, a smile creeps over his face at the array of food.



""Thanks,"" He says, reaching for a plate and loading it up with greasy breakfast foods.



Sherlock nods and eats a piece of bacon. ""That and the case. Oh here."" He gets a cushion and hands it to John to pad the chair.



""Anything new with the case?"" John asks while stabbing a sausage with his fork. He brings it to his mouth and pops the end in, sucking off some of the juices before taking a bite, and repeating the process with the rest of the sausage until it's gone.



Sherlock is distracted for a second before speaking. ""I found a few similar cases where the scent gland was removed but the paralytic is new. Someone with access to medical-grade chemicals.""



""Might be hard to track down. More people than you know have access to medical-grade chemicals... I mean, even pharmaceutical reps have access, in small quantities. It's amazing what they're allowed to carry on them.""



He snags a pancake, and takes a bite, humming in pleasure to see Sherlock had gone for the sweeter, American version of the breakfast. Sherlock hands him a bottle of syrup, which John slathers onto the meal, then licks his fingers clean.



Sherlock's chest feels warm as he watches John eat the food he prepared. ""John, you may be on to something."" He pulls out his phone.



""Mm? Of course, I am. I'm smarter than I look. Bloody army surgeon, not some GP.. Have you ever tried operating on someone while IEDs are going off around you?"" 



John smiles warmly, the food and Sherlock's apparent interest in his input on the case puffing up his feeling of self-worth. He'd known for quite some time that his 

love language

 was a mixture of words of praise and touch, and in the last 14 hours, he'd had a plethora of both.



""Wouldn't want anyone else performing surgery on me in a war zone."" Sherlock chuckles. ""Your experience and knowledge is very useful.""



""Keep saying that, it's nice."" John jokes, finally setting his fork down after devouring half the food on the table. ""You should eat something.""



Sherlock picks at John's leftovers. ""Quite a few of our cases wouldn't have been solved without your knowledge and social skills.""



""Go on..."" John says, leaning back in the chair and grinning wide. ""Kidding, you don't have to. Are you going to head out today, hit the pavement, and solve the case? I should be alright, as long as you lock the doors behind you.""



John thinks for a moment then asks, ""Well, I 

think 

I'll be alright. I can't smell myself... is it bad?""



Sherlock nods. ""You smell like you're in heat. I'm still waiting on some more information so going out isn't strictly necessary as of yet.""



""Shit, I can go wash up with that soap...""



John stands and stretches. He doesn't feel like he's in heat, a bit flushed, sensitive, and his clothes felt too restricting. But all in all, he felt normal like he'd just spent too long in a sauna and his body was still tingling from the heat. Once he'd worked the kinks out of his shoulders he brought his plate to the sink and headed down the hall, intent on a quick shower and a thorough scrub.



""You don't have to. It doesn't bother me."" Sherlock shrugs. ""It's up to you.""



John shrugs and continues down the hall, where Sherlock's scent was strongest near his bedroom.



""The thought of not wearing clothes is pleasant enough that I find I want a shower. Might test the hot water limits, so if you need hot water, get it now.""



""I got some bath bombs as well if you want another bath,"" Sherlock suggests. ""Anything I can do?""



""I'm alright,"" John assures Sherlock, disappearing into the bathroom. This time he shut the door, but took care not to shut it hard.



While the thought of another lazy bath with good conversation and company was tempting, he wasn't certain his body would allow him to keep it just that, pleasant company.  He breathed a sigh of relief the moment his clothes were off his skin, and stepped into the shower, pulling the curtain in tight so the steam wouldn't leak out.



""First things first... I'm going to have a bloody wank and see if that helps get this out of my system."" He muttered to himself, while stroking his hand down his stomach and cupping himself.



Sherlock cleans up breakfast and puts away the leftovers. He goes back to the living room and looks at the notes he has pinned to the wall.



The shower and wank are wonderful, but neither help alleviate John's level of discomfort. When the hot water starts to run out, he scrubs himself clean, opting for Sherlock's soap rather than his neutralizer, then steps out.



Dressed in just his pyjama bottoms, figuring there was no point in being uncomfortable in front of partial nudity, seeing Sherlock had sat in on his bath, he wanders out of the bathroom and curls back up on the sofa, watching Sherlock work.



""Here."" Sherlock hands John a black nondescript bag as he tacks some new notes to the wall. Inside the bag were a few different sex toys.



""Mmm... Thanks.. I guess?"" John says, blushing a bit when he saw the contents. Placing them on the floor beside the sofa he reaches for the weighted blanket and pulls it over his lower half, dragging it up to his ribs. ""Trying to avoid that, if possible. Sometimes scratching the itch just makes it worse.""



""As long as you're not suffering."" Sherlock shrugs, frowning as he looks at the wall.



""Suffering, no. Annoyed and slightly uncomfortable, yes."" John says, thinking about the Omega cowering in terror the night before. ""Trust me, I have it easy right now compared to her. Her terror will only amplify her heat, unbound as she is... she'll be lucky to.... Sherlock!"" 



John sits up, and reaches for the nearest phone, and begins poking at the keys.



""What if we're looking at this from the wrong angle? What if this was never about the dead Alphas, but about the Omega? She's going to need to be bound this heat or else her heat is going to be intolerable. Favorable, for an Alpha who's been trying to win the favour of an Omega who isn't interested.""



He taps out a quick message to Lestrade, asking who the paramedics were who'd taken her, and where she'd been brought to.



""All that Alpha had to do was orchestrate the right scenario, and make it so he was there when she needed him the most. Taking their scent glands might have been for fun, or just to throw us of the trail.""



""Oh. 

Oh John!

 You're brilliant!"" Sherlock grins. ""A savior complex. Saves her from the Alphas and then disappears so she can receive medical attention. We need to know where she is right now.""



""Sherlock..."" John says after a pregnant pause. He gets up, leaving the comfort of his temporary nest, and places both hands on either of Sherlock's arms.



""Be careful... I mean it. We're not completely defenseless, in our heats. Just like your scent has the ability to drive me nuts, Omegas can control their ability to bring an alpha to their knees. Seduction at its finest.""



He says, not realizing his slip, inserting Sherlock specifically into the scenario, rather than a generic Alpha. ""I could, with a single thought, have you on your knees with lust. Boost my pheromones purposefully to blind you with desire. It's temporary, and only enhances the Alpha's abilities and strengths in the end. But she could be using it to keep him away from her. She might even use it on you if you waltz in as her knight in shining armor. Better to bond with a Savior than the man inflicting so much stress. Might be best to send a beta in, or...""



He chews his lips for a moment, considering if he could trust Sherlock with the information, ""there's a group, a society of people whose goal is to aid omegas. Alphas like you who have no desire to cave to social standards of fuck, breed, then fuck some more. They pair a needy omega up with an Alpha, who will bond with them, then leave forever. I'll send you the details, they might be able to help, though she isn't capable of making a decision like that right now...""



He meets Sherlock's steady gaze, feeling the intensity of it and realizing his thumbs had been brushing small circles over Sherlock's arms.



Sherlock watches John intently, feeling his strong hands on him. ""Do it. Do it, John. Show me what I'd be up against."" He wanted to know how an omega could affect others and he needed to know the extent to which it could affect him.



Sherlock takes half a step closer, his chest pressed to John's as he rests his hands on the omega's hips. ""I need to know that I can resist it. That the Work isn't in danger of biological impulses. Please, John. You must show me.""



""Sherlock,"" John says, instilling a slight growl into his voice, ""I don't think you understand what you're asking me to do. It ramps up your instincts, you have displayed incredible control, but what if this breaks that? I don't want to be the reason you go against everything you've fought for.""



John takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He can feel the warmth of Sherlock's chest against his own bare skin and the fingers wrapped around his waist feel like branding iron.



""Cuff me to a chair then."" Sherlock's warm breath brushes against John's temple. ""I'm used to temptation, John. My entire existence and fraught with desire and temptation and addiction. Give me some credit."" He noses as John's hair lightly.



""No, not a chair, too easily moved. The radiator in the bathroom.""



John says, after a moment of thinking.



Sherlock goes off to get the cuffs, leaving John missing his presence mere centimeters away from him. Gathering himself for what he was about to do he squared his shoulders and met up with Sherlock in the bathroom.



""Not even going to ask why you have these,"" he murmurs, taking the cuffs from Sherlock and attaching one end to the sturdy radiator. ""Wrist, please. And remember, if you pull this will hurt you, not the radiator.""



Sherlock offers his wrist to be cuffed. ""Nicked them off Lestrade when he's annoying. I've been cuffed to a radiator before. I know the drill."" He smirks.



""Git..."" John smiles, despite himself and what he's about to do. ""You're... uh.. going to get hard, sorry.""



Sherlock shrugs. ""It happens occasionally. I ignore it and it goes away soon enough.""



""Hope you're right.... Do me a favor, reach out as far as you can? I need to make sure I'm not in danger of being grabbed.""



Sherlock reaches out as far as he can, pulling on the cuff and showing John the range of his reach. ""That's as far as I can go without gnawing my own hand off.""



With the back of his heels pressed against the side of the tub, John nods and sits on the edge.



""Sorry... in advance."" Casting Sherlock a single apologetic look he closes his eyes and focuses.



It's been years since he's had to do this, and while unpracticed, it's a trick any Omega can call up instantly. It's like taking a triple dose of ecstasy, but instead of being the one feeling the effects, he's the satellite.



He knows his pheromones have changed, growing more potent with the heady promise the scents carry with them. Sherlock's eyes instantly go wide and his nostrils begin to flare.



""Like this, Sherlock, I could say anything in the world. I could be telling you that you have a troll sized booger hanging out of your nostril, and all you'll hear is sex, sex sex.""



He wiggles a bit, the change making his body believe it would finally learn what it's like to be with an Alpha during his heat, something he'd denied himself his whole life.



""Can you talk still? Tell me how you're feeling? It takes a minute for it to kick in. Your body has to absorb my scent, then I can play with you.""



Sherlock breathes deeply, John's scent and pheromones washing over him. He closes his eyes and drops his head as he tries to focus. His cock filling out in his tight trousers. ""It's.. it."" He swallows. ""It's strong.""



""Yeah, sorry, there's no dial. Just on or off. It's mean to help us overwhelm an Alpha. Sometimes used for mutual fun, but mostly to escape tough situations. We can do it even when we don't have a heat, but it just dazes and confuses an assailant.""



Watching Sherlock's eyes, he waits until the pupils start rapidly narrowing then enlarging again.



""Right about now, you'll be feeling the full effect. Which means my words mean nothing to you.""



John shrugged and found himself wondering if Sherlock's mind was still intact if he could still deduce and read him as plain as a page in one of his mystery novels.



A low growl fills the room, making the hairs on his neck stand, and an electric shock rolls through his stomach.



It had been far too long since he'd heard an Alpha turn their attention on him, and here on the cusp of this strange heat, his body craved it.



John stands from the edge of the tub and inches closer, inhaling the Alpha's scent and letting his eyes flutter shut.



Notes of rich leather, honey, and caramel fill his nose and he lets out a low mewling sound.



""You.."" Sherlock shows his breathing. ""You can touch me, John. I won't touch you back."" He licks his lips. ""You're in charge. I'm at your mercy.""



""If I touch you, you won't like what happens next,"" John whispers, his mouth watering at the very thought of burying his nose in the V of Sherlock's groin.



""Your control is astonishing, but mine wouldn't be quite as impressive.""



Closing his eyes he focuses for a moment, then shudders as the warmth is sapped out of him. He's left feeling hollow and worn out, like a pair of ratty jeans that have managed to avoid the garbage bin far past their prime.



Placing the handcuff key on the floor he kicks it towards Sherlock then flees the bathroom, heading to his bedroom, giving both himself and Sherlock space while they sort themselves out.



Sherlock sits on the floor for some time, eyes closed and head down. Eventually, he reaches for the key and lets himself out of the cuff. He goes and stands at the bottom of the stairs. ""John? Are you alright?"" He calls up to John's room.



John has his hands down his pants when Sherlock calls up to him.



It doesn't feel right answering him, while his scent still lingered and fueled his fantasies, but the alternative was Sherlock walking in on him under the guise of checking on him.



Only, it wasn't a ruse, was it? Over the past day, Sherlock had displayed over and over that some part of him cared. Mr. I don't do sentiment had suddenly decided to show his heart. From the junk food to the blanket, to simply being willing to listen.



Sighing, John calls out ""Fine... go save her, Sherlock.""



Sherlock hesitates for a moment before getting his coat. ""If you need anything call me immediately. Mrs. Hudson won't let anyone in and if they try she's armed. I'll be back as soon as I can."" He races down the stairs and out the door.



John finishes his guilty wank, then cleans up, despite knowing Sherlock would be able to smell it the moment he walked back in the flat. In desperate need of fresh air, John drags every stitch of bedding he owns over to the window, throws the window open as wide as it can go, and curls up into a ball on the floor below it.


Sherlock finishes a case and Mycroft is a prick.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Hours later Sherlock comes home. He was sore and there was some dried blood smeared over his face but the woman was safe and the case was solved. ""John? I'm home."" He says as he takes off his coat.

Unable to sleep, due to his body feeling as if it were on fire, every ounce of him screaming for an Alpha, John is awake when Sherlock gets home. The nearby church bell rings two in the morning, and Sherlock's scent (stronger now that he's home) wafts up the stairs. Mixed with it is the vile scent of another Omega in heat and a coppery undertone.

John knows that scent well, it haunts his nightmares. Red blood dripping from men he was trying to save. The mixture of scents has him on his feet before his brain has time to catch up with his actions. He slithers, more than walks, down the stairs, every one of his movements betraying him as an Omega, rather than the soldier he'd become.

He finds Sherlock in the kitchen, turning the kettle on. Sauntering up to Sherlock he takes Sherlock's face in both hands and begins twisting it up towards the light, inspecting him for an injury.

""Yours? Or... hers.."" He growls, wondering how so much blood found its way to the corners of Sherlock's mouth. Anger boils up in him, imagining Sherlock's teeth sinking into the neck of someone. Someone else. Not his neck.

""Clam yourself, John. No one is bonded to me."" Sherlock says softly as he relaxes into John's touch. ""I went to the hospital to see her. While I was there the Alpha that's been stalking her hit me over the head with a bedpan. Fortunately for me, it takes more than that to knock me out. A fight broke out. He tried to strangle me as he slammed my head against the floor so I grabbed him by the hair and pulled him down, ripping his scent gland out of his neck with my teeth.""

John only hears half of what Sherlock said. His mind swimming and heart singing knowing that Sherlock was still unbonded.

""Sit,"" he orders, gathering himself. Placing a hand on Sherlock's shoulder he pushes him into one of the chairs. He hurries into the bathroom to retrieve his medical kit. The cuffs still dangle from the radiator, reminding him of Sherlock leaning against it. The outline of his cock hard and heavy against posh trousers.

Without realizing it, he mentally flips the pheromone switch. Then heads back out to the kitchen where he begins cleaning Sherlock's face with a warm cloth, dabbing antiseptic on the tiny scrapes he finds in Sherlock's pale skin.

""You should get tetanus, and rabies shot, if you aren't up to date. You probably ingested some of his blood, and who knows if he's clean or not.""

""Yes, John."" Sherlock closes his eyes, relaxing. ""I'll have my brother send someone to give me the jabs."" He mumbles, he spreads his legs, and tugs John a bit closer by his hips so John can reach him better. ""He was obsessed with her. He's been leaving her flowers and gifts inside her flats no matter how many times she moves. Apparently, he'd also been orchestrating scenarios where he could save her."" He hums as he rubs John's thighs.

John sighs, his body relaxing as Sherlock's fingers brush over the thin cotton of his pyjamas.
The simple act of providing care calms him, until he forgets his panic over thinking Sherlock had come back bonded. When he's done, and Sherlock's face is no longer stained crimson, he finds he doesn't want to step away. With Sherlock sitting, he's taller than the Alpha. Looking down, he stares at Sherlock's lips, licking his own lips, wondering what it would be like to simply lean forward and taste his mouth.

Sherlock looks up at him, reading his face. ""Let me have a shower and we can cuddle on the couch if you would like."" He says softly, seeing the stress and worry on John's face and how his presence eases that.

""Sofa is too small..."" John says, growling when Sherlock eases him back so he can stand. ""Your bed is bigger.""

Without allowing himself time to think, he heads down the hall, this time nudging the door at the very end of the hall open, entering the Alpha's domain. Sherlock's bed waits, like a life raft promising him warmth and safety.

He can tell by the dip in the pillow which side Sherlock favours, so he pulls back the blankets and climbs into the other side, nuzzling his nose against the bedding. It smells like Sherlock and soap. Heaven to his aching body. Muscles he hadn't realized he had been clenching begin to relax as he curls up on his side, facing the other half of the bed.

Sherlock goes and showered, scrubbing the rest of the blood off himself. Once he's clean he gets out and dries off before going to his room to get dressed. He lets the towel fall to the floor before pulling pants on and then his sleep flannel bottoms over them. ""Comfortable?"" He asks John as he texts Mycroft to send someone with the shots.

""Mmm, sheets are soft,"" John slurs while rubbing his face across the pillow. ""mine are all scratchy."" They smell nice too, like you.""

""Good."" Sherlock nods and gets into bed, relaxing on his side. ""How are you feeling? Have you eaten?""

""I can't recall the last thing I ate... but. I'm not hungry. The body sort of shuts down goes into hibernation mode. 'Specially for males, you don't want a lot of food in your system during a time you're supposed to be having nonstop sex.""

The blankets shift as Sherlock gets in. They slide and expose John's back to the cool night air. He tugs a corner close, then finds he has to nudge closer to Sherlock if he wants his back completely covered.

""When my shots arrive I'll make you some tea and toast."" Sherlock relaxes and turns towards John.

""Mm, just tea,"" John says around a yawn, shifting in the bed until his forehead is pressed against Sherlock's shoulder. ""I think I've turned the... thingy on, can't... remember ... to turn it off,"" he says brokenly, fighting off sleep.

""It's alright. Just relax."" Sherlock gently wraps his arm around John, holding him close.

John lets out a soft whine at the contact. Sherlock's bare skin is damp and still smells like his soap, the same soap John had used on himself earlier.

""I... this feels nice,"" John whispers moments before giving in and letting sleep take him.

Sherlock holds John, nuzzling John's hair. They stay like that for half an hour before Sherlock's phone vibrates. He reads the texts that his shots were there so he slowly gets up so he doesn't wake John. He goes downstairs and rolls his eyes when he opens the door. ""Mycroft.""

""Not a beta after all,"" Mycroft says, sniffing the air and frowning. ""Shall we expect a happy announcement by the end of the day?"" Mycroft points to a man, a beta underling, and points to the case Anthea is holding.

""A warning would have been nice, I might be older than you, but I still am an Alpha... his scent is... weak though. Not a full heat?""

""I wasn't expecting company. We'll do the jabs here."" Sherlock presents his arm to get it over with. ""He's taken care of it himself. I'm just here to make sure he's safe.""

""Mmm always the hero,"" Mycroft says, watching as his underling administers the shots. ""Taking care of more than one Omega in one night. Some might call that brave, but you know what I think.""

""You make your opinions known far and wide."" Sherlock sneers.

""Yes well, not everyone requires shots at half three in the morning, brother mine,"" Mycroft says as he turns around and heads back to his car, underlings following at his heel.

""I'll be by in a few days with the paperwork, he is unregistered, you know.""

""He won't sign anything under your pressure and I won't force him."" Sherlock snaps.

""Then fudge the details. Make it look real. Misspell a name, I don't care, Sherlock. It's to protect him as much as it is you."" Mycroft stops and turns back to his brother.

""What happens if he gets hurt while following you around London? Hmm? They won't treat him without an Alpha's consent, and that Alpha has to have claimed ownership of him. Worse yet, what if someone finds out he still has his service gun? Think about it, Sherlock. Both of you. I'll give you a few days.""

""I don't need your protection."" Sherlock snarls and slams the door, going back upstairs.

Sensing the change in mood John lift's his head and frowns at Sherlock when he comes back to bed. Sniffing once he wrinkles his nose.

""How was your brother? Annoying? Please tell me he was wearing a nightgown with one of those funny sleep hats that dangles past his chin.""

""No nightgown could cover his oversized arse,"" Sherlock grumbles as he tries to get comfortable. ""He was talking about you being unregistered.""

""Mm... 'strue. Military overrode my familial ownership. I was given a year to find an Alpha after being sent home... Technically I'm a ward of the Army, until then."" John says, instantly seeking out Sherlock's body for comfort once more.

Sherlock cuddles John to himself again. ""It's your choice. Whatever you need to do.""

""They need proof of a bond, or I get assigned a random Alpha,"" John mumbles, nuzzling his nose along Sherlock's neck. ""Don't want that. And I don't want to think about it right now. I just want to sleep right now.""

Sherlock growls softly, the thought of John being bonded against his will irritating. ""I won't let you be shipped off.""

""Not your usual case, and I can't pay well."" John yawns then slings his arm over Sherlock's stomach. ""Night, Sherlock...""

""You're not a case. You're my friend."" Sherlock holds him. ""Goodnight, John.""

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

The sun is well up when John finally wakes. There's a warm body beneath him, the rise and fall of their chest indicating that whoever his bedmate is, they're still asleep. John's cock is hard and aching, and over the course of the night, his pyjamas had grown damp with slick. He groans and nuzzles into the warmth, inhaling the calming scent of Sherlock.

Oh shit... Sherlock. John's eyes flash open and he half sits, wincing as his damp clothing sticks and slides uncomfortably across his arse. Sherlock is asleep, stretched out with one arm folded under his pillow, a typical Alpha sleep position. The other arm rests gently over John's lower torso. Thinking back, John vaguely remembered cleaning Sherlock's face, then crawling into bed.

Sherlock mumbles, his arm tightening around John's middle when he feels him move. Tired from the fight he had slept soundly. The slight fever from the injections made him not want to stay in bed.

As Sherlock sleepily pulls him back down into the cocoon of blankets, John finds he doesn't want to get up and flee for his bedroom. He and Sherlock had entered into the flatshare under the false pretense of a relationship. Since Sherlock had found out he was an Omega, all John could think about was what would happen if it wasn't a false relationship... what if it were real.

Laying his head on Sherlock's chest, his forehead brushes against Sherlock's cheek. He's warm, and out of habit, John feels the injection site. Warm, but not dangerously so. It's just the medication taking its course. He'd have to make sure that Sherlock drank plenty of clear fluids, and ate at least one solid meal, but he'd be fine by the end of the day.

Sherlock relaxes once John is against him again. He slept for a while longer before finally waking. ""Mm morning, John."" He mumbles, he had a slight headache and needed a coffee. ""How are you feeling?"" He rubs a hand over his face.

""Bout the same as yesterday..."" John shrugs then lies just a little, ""Don't think I'm any worse. You look like you've gotten into a fight or something. Caffeine, paracetamol, then lots of water today. Over exerting yourself in the fight means that today your muscles are breaking down toxins.""

They both lay there for a moment longer. Neither man willing to break apart. Neither of them willing to admit just how much they enjoyed the closeness. After a while though, John's situation made things difficult. His cock wouldn't soften, and the damp between his cheeks was only growing worse. Though he was loathed to move away from Sherlock's embrace, unsure if he'd ever be allowed to be this close to the Alpha again, necessity required him to change and use the bathroom.

""I erm... need a change of trousers... and for you to look away so I can get up without completely embarrassing myself.""

""Mm, I'll make coffee."" Sherlock nods and lets John go before getting up, shuffling out to the kitchen. ""Do you not remember last night?"" He asks, filling the coffee filter with a few scoops of coffee.

""Bits and pieces..."" John admits softly, following Sherlock through the kitchen. He felt grateful that Sherlock doesn't turn around, giving him privacy as he heads up to his room.

""I'll be down in a moment... fresh clothes.."" he says haltingly, heading up to his room where the window is still wide open.

Shutting the window he strips out of his soiled bottoms and slips on another pair of old and well broken in pyjamas. He'll need a shower, and by now those sex toys Sherlock had bought him were starting to sound appealing, but for now, he wanted tea, and just a few minutes to enjoy the lazy morning.

Sherlock waits for the coffee to drip, meanwhile, he decides to make toast. ""Which pieces?""

Sitting on the chair with the cushion, John thinks. ""I remember the movie and snacks. Then there was the whole handcuffing you to the radiator. Not sure I'll ever forget that."" He frowns a bit.

""You left... and I don't remember what I did, but my bedding is under my window, which suggests I was attempting to get fresh air. ""You came home late, then... there was blood, and judging by the bruise on your face it was yours?""

""Some of it."" Sherlock nods and sets a plate of toast in front of John with butter and jam so he can make it how he likes. He pours them both a coffee and tells John what happened the night before. ""The face you made when you smelled Mycroft on me was priceless."" He snorts.

""If I recall...."" John says around a smile, ""He smells like lemons that have been left out in the sun for too long."" John slathers butter, then jam, onto his toast and nibbles around the edge, eating the crust first. ""She's alright then? Did my contact help? Or was there another option?""

""It went as well as we could have hoped."" Sherlock nods. ""She'll be alright. Your contact is going to make sure she has somewhere safe and secure to stay.""

""Mm good.""

John shifts on the chair, wincing as another trickle of slick dampens his seat. ""I hate this part..."" He groans, pushing his half-eaten toast aside and laying his forehead on the table.

Sherlock frowns. ""I got some absorbent pads as well if you need them.."" He says softly, not wanting to upset John.

""Not sure I can tolerate pants right now... but if this gets any worse I'll have to suck it up.""

""I'm going to go lay down..."" Taking one final bite of his toast he picks up his mug and carries his coffee into the living room, where he promptly curls up on the sofa.

Sherlock finishes his coffee and cleans up from breakfast. ""Is there anything I can do?"" He asks, sipping a fresh cup of coffee as he walks into the living room.

""Bond me, fuck me, knot me, and make this all go away..."" John quips then winces as a wave of cramps hits.

""Cuddling helped, but I don't want you trapped in your bed all day. You're probably already sick of being cooped up with me""

""Ask me when you're not in the throes of a heat."" Sherlock snorts. ""What if I drag the mattress out here and we can watch something on the new projector?""

""Wouldn't it be easier just to move the projector?"" John grunts, then reaches for the heating pad Sherlock had bought for him.

""I'm not the genius here, but that makes more sense.""

""We can open the windows out here so you can get more fresh air."" Sherlock counters and sets his coffee mug down before plugging in the heating pad.

John grimaces at the living room. It would take a bit of effort to move everything in order to fit the mattress, but Sherlock wasn't wrong. Fresh air would help, and the two windows out here, versus the one they each had in their bedrooms, would allow for better circulation.

""Yeah, alright... Just, let me help?""

""It's fine. I'll just roll you onto the mattress."" Sherlock moves the furniture around and brings the mattress out, setting it in front of the couch so they could sit with their backs against the couch if they wanted. He opens the window, letting the fresh air in. ""Ready when you are.""

""Stubborn git,"" John grumbles, though the smile on his face lets Sherlock know he's anything but grumpy. ""We should watch something you like this time. What about unsolved mysteries?""

""Alright."" Sherlock smiles and gets them both some water and settles onto the mattress.

Joining him, John instantly curled up on his side, his head finding Sherlock's chest and finding it the perfect pillow. While Sherlock searched for something for John to watch, and him to shout at, John thought back over the last day and a half.

Since taking up the flatshare they'd been forced to pretend to be a couple. That meant going out of their way to touch each other as a couple might in front of Mrs. Hudson. Gentle touches, or passing brushes of hands against arms as they passed each other.

At first, it had required thought. But within a few weeks, John had found he did it automatically. He'd even noticed the jolt of excitement he'd feel when Mrs. Hudson would come up for a visit, and Sherlock would gravitate closer to him.

Now, knowing what it felt like to have Sherlock's arms around him, holding him tight, and sleeping next to the man. (Okay, sleeping on top of Sherlock, if he were being completely accurate.) John wasn't sure those casual touches would be enough for him anymore.

""I can't remember... real or a dream, Mycroft mentioned something about me needing to get registered again?""

""Unfortunately real."" Sherlock sighs. ""He has to stick his fat nose into everything. Especially where it doesn't belong. He's worried about me getting into legal trouble."" He rolls his eyes. ""I'm not even worried about it.""

""But I am. We both could face some serious problems... Did he tell you that I can't get medical care, emergency or otherwise until I'm registered? I can get the basics through the army, of course... but."" John shrugs against Sherlock's chest and sighs.

""I'll have to figure something out. Been toying with calling that number I gave you. One call, they'd pair me with an Alpha who would bond me, and then we'd never see each other again. He'd get all my legal requests, and just sign off on everything. Not ideal, but it's better than a forced bond where I'm stuck living with them.""

A deep angry growl slips from Sherlock's throat before he can stop it. ""Sorry.."" He apologizes, not having meant to growl like that.

""Mmm don't be sorry, I rather share that sentiment,"" John says gently while inwardly his chest puffs at the rich sound. It was nice to have someone angry on his behalf. Normally people just gave him a pitying glance and placating words of apology.

""What if.."" Sherlock starts and then stops, thinking. ""What if you registered with me?""

""Could do... but they'd need proof of a bond. Not sure how we'd get around that mountain of a detail."" John nudges his nose along Sherlock's chest, ""though... it isn't the worst idea. Quite possibly my best option. If I ended up in the A&E, that'll probably mean we were on a case, and you'd be by my side anyways. On hand for any paperwork.. so to speak.""

Sherlock nods. ""We could fake it. Prosthetics for a bond mark."" He rubs his fingers through John's hair.

""What if I don't want to fake it"" almost slips out before John clamps his mouth shut and just nods. Sherlock's offer was quite possibly the best offer he'd ever receive, and he didn't want to ruin it by scaring his friend off.

""Hit play,"" he says instead, leaning into the feeling of long fingers dancing across his head.

""I.."" Sherlock blinks. ""I've never thought about having an Omega but if I did I'd want one like you."" He says softly as he presses play.

""Mmm.."" John hums, opting for pleasant but noncommittal. He wants to turn around and press their chests together, then their mouths. To taste those lips that so often speak harsh but brilliant words. Instead, he focuses on the cheesy crime show and settles for nuzzling a bit closer, adjusting the heating pad so it covers his stomach.

Sherlock talks back to the show about how they're all idiots and wrong while he gently massages John's scalp. ""Honestly I don't know how any crime ever gets solved unless the perpetrator is standing there red-handed on film with eyewitnesses and holding their confession.""

""Greg would love that,"" John says with a laugh, then suddenly he's curling up and whimpering. His stomach cramps, deep shooting pains that go from his ribs to his groin, he feels like he's being flayed open. Slick oozes out of him, leaving him feeling undignified and wrecked as he struggles to think past the cramps.

Sherlock frowns. He rolls John onto his stomach and makes sure he stays in the heating pad. He moves behind John and massages his lower back. ""It's getting worse, John. Tell me what to do.""

""Not sure... my body is fighting back. It's been..."" He whimpers a bit and tries to think, ""ten years since my last heat. Not enough is known about Omega's who suppress their biology long term. It just... isn't done.""

John grits his teeth through the cramps and laughs pitifully, ""I'd be an interesting case to study... you should take notes.""

John suffers and Sherlock tries to make things better...


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

""You're not a subject. You're in pain.""Sherlock says around a frown, ""Should I get the toys?"" He begins massaging John's back and hips. ""You feel so tense.""

""God no. They're a last-ditch effort. But at this rate, I'll be out of clean clothes by the end of the day..."" Grunting John does his best to focus on Sherlock's fingers. ""That... helps.""

""I'll do laundry. And you can borrow mine."" Sherlock keeps massaging.

""Fuck me..."" John groans, more swearing than actually asking to be fucked. No one had warned him that it would be this bad, but then again it wasn't as if cases like John's were normal.

Most Omegas who joined the military ended up bonded to someone in their unit. As a couple, they'd be given furlough every six months to copulate. The omega was expected to refrain from getting pregnant until they were no longer on active duty, but it gave their body a chance to regulate.

John had opted out of that option. Then there was the simple fact that no one, aside from his CO, knew he was an Omega. Being a doctor allowed him the privilege of showering in the hospital, and private quarters. Both of which helped him maintain his secret.

Sherlock takes off his shirt and hands it to John before continuing to massage. He works down John's leg, over his back, and back down the other leg. ""I'm sorry. I'm sure being close to an Alpha isn't making this better. Maybe I should leave you be.""

""I think it would be worse, knowing I'm alone."" John grunts, stuffing the soft shirt as close to his nose as he can without actually shoving it by his nose. ""You help... your scent helps. Please don't leave me alone."" From their vantage point, he can see the bag containing the toys, a low growl fills his chest. ""Not with them. I will not be reduced to fucking myself with a synthetic cock.""

""What if I fuck you with it?"" Sherlock asks, leaning in and scenting John by scrubbing his face along the back of John's neck.

""I don't want them. God, Sherlock."" John growls out, rubbing his neck against Sherlock's face. ""I want you, can't you see that? But it would be incredibly stupid because anything right now would result in me carrying your pups. And while I'm not against the idea, I need time to think, to process everything without having to pick out baby names.""

""When your heat is over we'll discuss it."" Sherlock nuzzles his scent gland. ""What can I do to help you now?""

""We'll discuss it? You're not saying no.."" John practically melts into the mattress with relief. He'd been so worried over losing the constant touches and kindness from the Alpha, that his body had reacted to the stress by intensifying his symptoms. As he relaxed, the cramps subsided and he let out a sigh. ""Just... keep rubbing me. Erm, my back, that is. Unless... no bad idea.""

""You're the best thing that ever happened to me, John. I can't say no to you. We'll talk when you're able to consent and have a coherent conversation."" Sherlock keeps rubbing. ""It's not a bad idea if it helps. Where do you want my hands?""

""Anywhere... everywhere. I want to feel you touch every inch of my body, and I want to touch yours."" John says, closing his eyes and humming at the feel of Sherlock's fingers pressing into tender muscles.

""You can touch me, John. Any way you'd like."" Sherlock works his hands over John's tight muscles, making sure to keep them from his crotch or arse.

At Sherlock's words, John lets out a low mewling noise. He surges forward, pulling himself up into his elbow quick as a flash, then acts before Sherlock has time to react. Using his legs for leverage he grips Sherlock's biceps and flips him onto his back, laying him flat against the mattress. John straddles Sherlock's hips and moans when his cock presses up against Sherlock's groin.

""Fuck..."" Leaning forward he places his forehead against Sherlock's chest and shudders.

It's hard to keep his hips still, but he manages and after a long moment he sits up, placing both his palms on Sherlock's chest he begins letting his fingers explore over pale skin.

Sherlock smiles up at him, a blush over his cheeks at being manhandled. ""You can grind against me if you need to. I won't stop you."" He rubs his hands over John's thighs.

""Mm probably a bad idea,"" John groans, ""not sure I can control myself if I start that. Let me just touch you for now. Put your hands on my back.""

Sherlock nods, pressing his big warm hands to John's back. ""Have you ever touched an Alpha like this John? Ever imagined an Alpha would submit to your needs?""

""I've never been touched by an Alpha at all,"" John admits, rolling his back against the broad hands splayed against his skin. He drags his fingers across the various scars on Sherlock's body.

""I never let myself show as an Omega. It was embarrassing for my family to have me go into heat. My heats have been suppressed since a young age, and I've done all I can to pass as a beta."" John scoffs, his face going sour. ""Can't get the wrong attention if you just hide your whole life.""

""You don't have to hide anymore, John. You don't have to hide from me. I'll keep you safe. I won't let anyone hurt you."" Sherlock promises, on hand coming up and rubbing against John's scent gland in his neck.

They may have started out faking their relationship but after a few weeks into the ruse, Sherlock had told Lestrade the truth. Not only did he tell him that it was fake but he also told Lestrade that he wishes it wasn't. How he was afraid to lose John by being too Sherlock or that John would leave him for someone else.

""I've never.. I've never wanted anyone as close to me as you are. People are so stupid and hateful, John. But you. You're brilliant. You're so strong and brave. You make me laugh until it hurts. I can't imagine working or living without you. You've become a center point of my life. I was adrift and I didn't even know it until you limped into my view and changed everything. I said it before, I'm at your mercy."" He rubs John's back and hips. He knew John's pheromones were affecting him. He couldn't feel it. But if anything they made it easier for him to say what he'd been holding back instead of making up, or suppressing feelings.

""I.. I want to kiss you. For real. Not just a quick peck for our land lady's sake"" John sighs, his hips rolling against Sherlock as if acting on their own free will.

""It stopped being fake for me weeks ago, John."" Sherlock blushes, angling his hips a bit so John can get better friction.

John surges forward at Sherlock's admission. With his chest flat against Sherlock's chest, he plants one hand beside Sherlock's face, the other hand cupping stubbly skin. He rubs their noses together, then presses his thin lips against Sherlock's full lips. He moans upon contact, hips sliding and his left hand playing with Sherlock's jawline. The moment is bliss, and John finds himself wanting to stay like that, never to move again.

Sherlock wraps his arms tight around John, holding him close as they kiss. He pulls back just enough to lick at John's neck. ""When this heat is over we'll talk. We'll figure out what we both want. What we need. For now, I'm going to kiss you as my life depends on it."" He mumbles, his voice rumbling deep in his chest before he kisses John again.

John gasps as Sherlock's tongue slides over his neck. It's the first time an Alpha has ever touched him there. He shivers and falls into Sherlock's words, wrapping the promise around him like a blanket.

""My life does depend on it,"" He says greedily, and while it isn't exactly true, it feels right. Every fiber of his body is screaming to be close to Sherlock, to touch and be touched.

Sherlock's tongue slides across his lips and he parts them, letting it dip inside him. Their first breach of two becoming one. Sherlock gently teases and explores John's mouth with his tongue, his fingers finding their way to John's hair and pulling just enough to make him groan. He holds John's hip in his other hand and rocks his hips up against John's. He can feel John's slick starting to dampen his pants.

""Sherlock..."" John gasps, rolling his lower half against the grip and the friction. ""I... I want to come, is that okay?""

His body desperately needs another orgasm, even if achieved without any form of internal stimulants. It feels good, amazing even, to have those long fingers digging into his hips, ghosting over skin, every now and then dipping below his waistband. He can feel Sherlock's length against him, hard and hot, the heady scent of Sherlock's matching desire filling his nose.

John breaks away from the kiss and gives into his most basic instinct. He rubs his neck and cheeks against Sherlock's body, his neck, his chest, his face. He wants Sherlock to smell like him, to claim him so the rest of the Omegas knew that this Alpha was courting someone else.

Sherlock groans, rubbing his face against John's neck. ""Will you come on me? Mark me? Claim me? Make sure all the other Omega's know I'm yours? I want that. Please, John.""

""Yeah... yeah."" John husks out, swallowing a lump of emotion as he reaches down and fumbles with his trousers. He manages to get them partially off, hanging on by one leg only. He doesn't care, it's enough to free his cock, and that's all that matters. He wants to see Sherlock's cock, compare them and rub their erections together, but just the simple act of touching himself is already sending him over the edge.

Reaching between his legs he gathers some of his slick on his fingertips and coats his cock with it. It takes less than a dozen strokes before he's shaking and crying Sherlock's name. Milky come oozes from his tip and drips onto Sherlock's taught stomach, the sight causing John to growl through his ecstasy. Once he's spent, he slides his fingers through the mess on Sherlock's stomach and hums appreciatively, smearing it into Sherlock's skin and enjoying the way their two scents combine.

Sherlock growls, not one of anger or aggression but of need and want. ""Mine. My Omega. I'll be your Alpha. I'll be so good to you. Whatever you need. Whatever you want. Yours. All yours."" He licks his lips as he watches John come.

Sherlock's words cloud John's judgment. He'd long scoffed at silly Omegas who bend over backward at being claimed. But now hearing those words, he finds he wants to hear them again and again.

Without thinking he moves until He's sitting on Sherlock's calves. He paws at the waistband of Sherlock's pyjamas and claws them down to his thighs. His cock is hard, and massive, the perfect specimen of Alpha. There's no swollen knot, telling John that above all odds Sherlock has retained some control over himself.

He leans forward and rubs his cheek against the firm velvety skin, then wraps his lips around its crown. He glances up, his intention clear. He wants to taste Sherlock, taste the Alpha who'd been kind when others would claim and take.

""You can do whatever you'd like. But I won't fuck you. Not yet. Not until we're both sane and clear-headed."" Sherlock groans, his cock hard and pulsing.

It takes a bit more effort than it had for himself, but before long he can smell the change in Sherlock. He was close, and John wanted every ounce of come inside him. And if the Alpha wouldn't fuck it into him, then he'd just have to swallow it. Wrapping one hand around the base, John moves his head faster, sucking harder and rolling his tongue. He can't fit Sherlock fully into his mouth, but he does his best.

""John... John... John!"" Sherlock babbles and chants, John's name, a plea, and a prayer on his lips. His cock throbs for John and soon it's all too much. John's smell, his warmth, his attention, his mouth. It's too much. Then Sherlock is coming, filling John's mouth with his hot potent come.

John's Omega side sings and preens as Sherlock's come bursts into his mouth and throat. He swallows, not wanting to waste a single drop. He sucks until Sherlock is thoroughly spent and is twitching below him. Only then does John let Sherlock's softening cock slide from his mouth. He climbs off of Sherlock's legs and curls up against Sherlock's side, closing his eyes and humming happily.

""Maybe... I'll let you use those toys on me, if I get to do that again."" He says smugly, enjoying the way his Alpha tastes in his mouth.

""Mm, I'll do anything you want. As soon as I can feel my body again."" Sherlock slurs a bit as he wraps his arm around John. He hadn't come in years and he certainly never came like that.

Tugging John impossibly close he nuzzles her hair and scents him, wanting John to be smothered in him. ""How are you feeling?""

""Mmm..."" John thinks, consulting his body with a sluggish inward gaze, ""better, I think. Orgasms help, you help. Was that.. okay? I should have asked.""

""If that's what orgasms are supposed to feel like, maybe I'll partake more."" Sherlock kisses John's head. ""It was phenomenal.""

""Mmm, they can be nice, if shared with the right person. Solo missions are a bit like finding cheese in the fridge and planning a meal around it, just to find out the cheese is mouldy.""

John nuzzles close and drags a blanket up over their exposed bodies.

""Going to have a nap, wake me if the flat catches on fire.""

""I'll just carry you out."" Sherlock rubs his fingers through John's hair.

John grins as he falls asleep, the thought of Sherlock carrying a naked Omega through flames somehow felt perfectly them.

Thanks for reading! Leave a comment and let us know what you think!

With John's pseudo heat behind them, they discuss bonding and what that means.

Hope you're enjoying this! We have a fun twist coming up soon! - Tindo

John sleeps for the better part of an hour, and when he wakes he finds the cramps have subsided and a dry uncomfortable feeling tells him he's stopped producing slick.

""Sherlock?"" he groans, lifting a head and finding the Alpha watching him. He can still taste Sherlock in his mouth, so he doesn't have to ask if the blow job was real. Instead, he just gives the Alpha a small smile, then nuzzles his face against his chest.

""Your heat seems to have broken."" Sherlock rubs Johns's back. ""You stopped smelling so strong about twenty minutes ago. How do you feel?""

""I've been better, but I've also been worse. My arms don't ache from fucking myself. Can't imagine that would have done my shoulder any favours."" John sighs and shifts under the blanket. He needs the bathroom, but at the same time, he doesn't want to leave Sherlock's side.

Sherlock nods. ""How about I order us some takeaway and we can share a shower while it's on the way?"" He offers, knowing John needs to eat and his alpha instincts wanting to provide for his omega.

""There's still half of yesterday's curry in the fridge... get something that pairs with it, like.. more curry."" John says with a grin, as the words ""we, share and shower"" sink in.

""Please tell me you enjoy hot showers that melt your skin off.""

""More curry."" Sherlock chuckles and gets his phone, sending a text for the order. ""I'll boil the water myself if you want."" He snorts.

Kicking off his pyjamas, which still clung to one leg, John gets up and stretches, unashamed of being naked in broad daylight.

He gets to the bathroom first, and steps into the shower, flicking the water on, he ramps up the hot water and stands under the spray while waiting for Sherlock.

Once the Alpha has joined him, he gives Sherlock a few moments under the water, then crowds him against the shower wall.

""I remember everything, every nice thing you did for me. Every promise, every touch."" He whispers, lips ghosting along with Sherlock's ear. ""You, Sherlock Holmes, are one very sexy Alpha.""

""Good because I meant every word."" Sherlock runs his hands over John's wet hot skin. He teases his fingertips over John's low back, nearly touching his arse.

""I want you to bond me... during my next heat. I want you, Sherlock."" John says, his eyes fluttering closed under Sherlock's touches.

""If you're willing, I'll skip my suppressants, let myself have a natural, unhindered heat, and we can bond... become one. And if you're willing, we'll have to have a serious talk about expectations, children, shared spaces... ownership.."" The last word slides off John's tongue like acrid grease, but there is little he can do about it.

Once bonded, legally his rights turnover and belong to his Alpha, it wasn't ideal, but he felt safe in Sherlock's hands.

""I would not be owning you, John. If anything you'd be owning me. You're the more stable, more human one."" Sherlock nuzzles him. ""I want to bond with you. Not bond you to me but us to each other. We'll still solve cases and eat takeaway. You'll still have rows with the chip n pin machine and I'll still make a mess of the flat. Nothing has to change so dramatically. We'll just be each other, formally and legally. I have no interest in owning you or being your warden. You're a grown man who can certainly take care of himself. The jury is still out on me on that account."" He chuckles softly.

""Yeah well, try telling the government that,"" John laughs, nuzzling along Sherlock's wet neck.

""Just sign the damned paper. It'll be like our secret, getting one up on the governing body of idiots.""

Sherlock hums softly, thinking. ""You may be on to something there, John..""

""Course I am."" John giggles then reaches behind Sherlock for the bottle of expensive body wash.

He squeezes a palm-full of the blue gel into his hand then replaces the bottle. Lathering it up between his hands he looks up at Sherlock and shrugs.

""Lots of mates do it... If they're true mates. The Alpha understands that it's a joint bonding, and just signs the bloody paperwork so the government leaves them alone. I think... I'd be able to call you my mate. It feels right, saying it even now.""

John places his palms on Sherlock's chest and begins working the rich lather over Sherlock's body. When he reaches the spot where his come had been, he smiles and skips over the area, wanting to preserve some of his scent on Sherlock's body.

""But the paperwork goes one way. The alpha assumes control of the omega. What if we did it both ways?"" Sherlock relaxes under John's touch.

""It doesn't exist."" John shrugged. ""Not that I haven't thought about that, but it would take reforming the whole system.""

John guides Sherlock to turn, so he can soap up his back, and arse, hands moving automatically with his familiarity with the human body.

""Sure, such a proposition would be met with praise and welcomed arms by so many. But the upper class, those with money and power, would squash any rays of hope before any new bill even had the chance to be voted on. People have tried, Alphas like you, who understand that I'm human, not a baby factory.""

John sighs and presses a kiss to the back of Sherlock's shoulder.

""But it never passes. The rich like owning things and that includes Omegas. What would they do if they couldn't own something they'd grown accustomed to having their whole life?""

""You're thinking too large scale. Just because the law doesn't have a statute for it doesn't mean we can't do it. We can draft our own contract within the bonding contract. There are always amendments in bonding paperwork, usually for the benefit of the alpha. We can make our own amendments and add whatever we like. It'll set a new president and they won't be able to change it because it is a contract between a private citizen and their intended mate."" Sherlock lets John do as he likes.

""Could work,"" John muses, dipping his hands low over Sherlock's body, fingers skimming his inner thighs.

""It would require a good lawyer from a firm that's been around ages. If the wrong Alpha is set to record our contract, and he reads the terms, he might push back.""

John's fingers dip between Sherlock's arse cheeks, then back down his thighs before John is turning them so his back is pressed against the wall and Sherlock standing under the water.

""I'd rather not involve my brother but he would have the connections."" Sherlock sighs. He reaches out for the shower gel and starts to rub sudsy hands over John. ""You mentioned children..""

""Yeah well... with me it's a biological possibility. Most suppressors have a contraceptive in them, but there are some that don't.""

John closes his eyes and sighs as Sherlock's hands roam over him.

""I've never really given it much thought, figured I'd never meet an Alpha worth two shits, so it didn't pertain to me.""

Sherlock washes and massages John's shoulders as he listens to him. ""What about now? Are pups something that you'd want?""

""Erm,"" John stops and thinks. Imagining what life would be like with the sounds of shrieking children running about. ""It isn't a terrible thought, as long as they're half yours. But I'm not exactly jumping up and down at the thought of rushing into it.""

He cracks a grin, remembering Sherlock's complaint the previous night.

""You could train them to solve crimes, send them off as interns to teach those coppers from that show how to solve a murder. They'd be smart, just like you, of that I'm sure.""

""They'd be able to take over the Yard before they were out of nappies."" Sherlock smirks. ""And I'm not the only smart one, John. You're a doctor, a brilliant surgeon. A lifesaver. I may be smart but they'd have your kindness and compassion as well. Maybe just a bit of your temper."" He chuckles.

He works his hands down John's body, washing away the dried slick.

""But you're right. I'm certainly in no rush. It'll probably take me quite some time to figure out how to be in a relationship let alone take care of a pup."" He says softly.

""It's... interesting,"" John sighs, enjoying Sherlock's fingers gliding over his arse and thighs. He arches into the touch and continues, his voice a bit more husky, ""Imagining what a human would be like having both of our traits. One minute they'd be pouting and throwing a Sherlock-sized temper tantrum, the next they'd be stomping their foot demanding an ice lolly at the top of their lungs.""

He smiles a little, realizing he wasn't totally against the idea of children. He still had a few more childbearing years left in him, and he felt a small clench in the pit of his stomach.

""I'm going to need time to adjust to this as well. Years of fighting off my body's need for an Alpha is going to make this tough. I might snap at you, and push you away once in a while. If I do, I'm sorry...""

""I've never been in any kind of relationship before so I'm sure I will screw up plenty."" Sherlock hums as he finishes washing John, watches the suds slowly slide down John's skin. ""If you don't ever want pups that's fine. If you do we'll talk about it when the time comes.""

John smiles and nods then reaches for Sherlock's shampoo. Afraid of getting it in Sherlock's eyes, he washes his own hair and passes the bottle over.

""Maybe someday."" He agrees, amazed at how easy it had been to reach an agreement on a topic that caused so many fights. ""I'll make sure to get a contraceptive today and start taking it right away. That way there are no accidents with my next heat.""

Leaning his head under the spray of water he washes the shampoo from his hair then says, ""What about normal heats... they're roughly every three months, though my body might be a bit out of sync. Do you want me to have them, or should I take suppressants again after we bond?""

""That is completely up to you. It is your body and your heats. I don't have any right to tell you how you should manage them."" Sherlock tips his head under the spray, washing the shampoo out. ""I will say that I think after being on suppressants for so long and your body's reaction to this heat that maybe you should try going suppressant-free and see how that works for you. If it's too much you can go back on suppressants. Whatever you choose I'll support you.""

""Could be inconvenient... if we're on a case."" John sighs, ""I can't control when they happen, just if they happen.""

He thinks about it and nods, letting Sherlock have his turn with the water.

""But you're right. I should let my body normalize a bit. Those military-grade suppressors are something else. Work like a charm, but they clearly fucked with me. I wasn't even supposed to have a heat, it was just supposed to be a period of discomfort that I was supposed to wait out, then swap brands.""

""Cases hold. And if it won't then someone else can solve it unless it's dire. We'll just keep an eye out and see if your heats fall into a cycle. Either way, we can work it out. I can review evidence while you're sleeping between rounds."" Sherlock shrugs as he rinses.

""You make it sound so... simple."" John glances over at Sherlock before stepping out of the shower. ""Thank you.""

""I don't like struggling. Every situation has an answer and can be resolved. If you're going to be my omega that makes you more important than the Work."" Sherlock says and then blinks, never having thought anything would be more important than the work let alone an omega.

""That sounds... strange."" John laughs, grabbing a second towel he passes it to Sherlock. ""But I can see by your stunned expression that it's genuine.""

Wrapping the towel around his hips, he grabs his toothbrush and begins washing the fuzzy feeling off his teeth. He'll need to go upstairs and change, but for now, he's happy staying in the humid warmth of the bathroom while they wait for food to arrive.

Sherlock nods as he dries himself. ""I've never thought of anything besides the work. I mean drugs for a bit there but that was just between cases to fill the void. I'm not sure what this means exactly.""

""Neither am I, if that makes you feel any better,"" John says around a mouthful of toothpaste. He spits into the sink then pops the toothbrush back into his mouth.

""My whole life I've been running from Alphas. Avoiding communal showers, or contact sports... God, I missed rugby. We got a good team going back in Afghanistan. With those blockers I could play again, that was heaven.""

Spitting again, he rinses off his toothbrush and leans against the sink.

""I avoided any scenario that would out me as being anything other than a Beta. Even though it was hard explaining how a bonded Alpha and Omega produced a beta, it was easier than saying what I truly was. I would have been sold off, Sherlock... become the property of one of London's elitists. Men like your brother...""

Sherlock growls at the mention of his brother, like a spectator over their happiness. ""Sorry. He just pisses me off. We've been having this fight since I woke up in the hospital after getting the shit beat out of me in school""

""Siblings, huh?"" John says, rolling his eyes. ""You should meet Harry. She claims I drove her to drink by my refusal to accept who I was.""

Pushing himself up off the sink John runs his hand over Sherlock's jaw. ""I like the stubble... it's rugged.""

With that, he lets his hand drop and heads upstairs for clothes. Catching sight of the mess in the sitting room he smiles. The effort Sherlock had gone to in order to make him comfortable made his heart flutter and butterflies take root in his stomach.

Sherlock looks at himself in the mirror as he brushes his teeth. He decides not to shave and keeps the stubble, he would deny it had anything to do with John. He got dressed and was just about done fixing his hair when the food delivery arrived downstairs. He headed down and got the food when he heard the knock.

Dressed in comfortable trousers, and a cotton t-shirt, John joins Sherlock in the kitchen.

He smiles at the dark stubble on Sherlock's chin but doesn't say anything.

While Sherlock lays the new food out, he goes to the fridge and re-heats the curry from earlier.

""So... I um, gave you a blowjob."" John says the moment Sherlock places a fork full of food in his mouth. ""Good?"" He asks, letting Sherlock decide if he meant the blowjob or the food.

""John, I couldn't feel my legs for a good five minutes. I think that means it was very good."" Sherlock blushes a bit. ""No one has ever done that for me before.""

John grins, then tucks into his meal. ""Good.""

While he eats, he finds himself thankful for the way things had turned out. If Sherlock had taken offense to his biology, things would have been incredibly different right now. He might not even have a home anymore.

When half his meal is gone, he looks up and catches Sherlock's eye.

""Can I call you 'my Alpha' even before we bond? Or... would you like time to get used to this?""

""In my head, I'm already referring to you as my omega, an unconscious switch on my part, so whatever you'd like."" Sherlock nods as he rips a section of naan and uses it to scoop some food. ""My brother is going to be insufferable about this."" He rolls his eyes.

""Let's not tell him until we need him to babysit,"" John says, his lips quirking up into a smirk.

""Knowing his goons he'd probably know you were carrying a pup before you did."" Sherlock snorts. ""And besides if we ever need a babysitter he is the last on the list behind Molly and Mrs. Hudson and my homeless network.""

""Mm you'd know before I knew."" John countered, still smiling at the thought of dropping a screaming child into the lap of Mycroft Holmes. It would be an added bonus if said child came with a full nappy.

""My scent would change almost instantly. Might take you a week or two to notice, but you'll know long before I can sense the change.""

Finishing his food, John scoops a bit more curry onto his plate and swipes some Naan through the sauce.

""So, what do we do in the meantime, while we wait for my next heat? Go back to normal? I go back to my room, you to yours? We... what? Kiss occasionally?""

""First we register together and get that out of the way so neither you nor I get in trouble. Then we make our own bond contact."" Sherlock finishes his last bite. ""I would like kisses to be a bit more often than occasional."" He can't help the blush creeping over his high cheekbones.

""Me too... and I'd like to not always sleep alone,"" John adds, feeling his face mirroring Sherlock's blush.

""I enjoyed sleeping beside you.""

""As do I."" Sherlock smiles. ""You also haven't had any nightmares while we've been sharing sleeping arrangements.""

John pauses, his mouth hanging open. It was true, normally his heats came with terrible nightmares. Before ware they were scenarios of less than favourable situations where he'd been caught out on the cusp of his heat, unable to seek shelter as bodies closed in around him.

After war, they'd morphed into strange scenarios where his former friends would rise from the dead and blame him for being an Omega for the reason they weren't still alive.

""Not one,"" he breathed.

""That's a good thing. Right?"" Sherlock asks softly, looking a bit unsure.

""Amazing."" John nods.

They share a small smile, then John stretches his foot out under the table, making contact with Sherlock's. And it was enough.

Both their bodies leaned into the touch. Sherlock's other foot stretched out and met his. They sat like that for a while, talking softly about their hopes for the future, and of past cases.

When the food was gone, John tried not to make a big deal over Sherlock offering to help clean up. Instead, he just passed Sherlock the tea towel and let him dry the dishes.

When the kitchen was cleaned up, they tackled the living room together, replacing Sherlock's mattress to its proper place, replacing the furniture, and mostly shutting the windows.

A passerby below sniffed hard, and glanced up as John leaned out to grab the window, he smirked up at him, a knowing look on his face.

John found he didn't hate being looked at like an Omega. It was fine, as long as he was Sherlock's omega.

Sherlock goes to John and looks out the window. He snarls when he sees the man down on the sidewalk. ""Keep moving or I'll cut you from cock to chin!"" He snaps.

John barks out a laugh and pulls Sherlock back into the flat.

""Alright, Alpha, calm your tits.""

Leaning up on tiptoes he pressed a kiss to Sherlock's cheek.

Sherlock leans in and nuzzles John, resting his hands on his hips. ""Sorry. That may have been a bit overboard.""

""Perhaps, a bit."" John agrees though he's smiling. ""I don't mind, but let's not go alienating our neighbors.

""There you go being socially conscious again."" Sherlock teases and smiles.

""One of us has to be.""

Giggling he wraps his arms around Sherlock's middle and pulls him tight against his chest.

""Now what? We just waltz into the nearest registration office and demand a blank contract form?""

""We could and time how long it takes my brother to arrive."" Sherlock snorts.

""Let's do that tomorrow. I have a better idea. You said you'd touch me after my heat is over. Well, it's over.""

John raises an eyebrow at Sherlock and nods towards his bedroom.

""There's a lovely, freshly made bed that I would love to mess up.""

Sherlock blushes and nods. ""Perhaps it's too fresh and clean.""

""Oh?"" John stops. Planting both hands on his hips he quirks his head up at Sherlock. ""Is that your way of saying that one orgasm is good enough this year?""

""No, I just-"" Sherlock starts.

""SHERLOCK HOLMES! You get down here this instant!"" Mr. Hudson calls from downstairs.

John and Sherlock share a look, and then John shrugs.

""After you, she sounds mad. I'll let my big scary Alpha go first.""

Sherlock bites his lip and goes down the stairs.

""Why are there purple stains on my carpet?"" Mrs. Hudson points down to the carpet where bright purple stains had marred her carpet.

""Well you see I needed some dye for an experiment and I didn't know that the bottle had a hole."" Sherlock looks apologetic. ""I did try to scrub them out.""

John stands back and crosses his arms over his chest. He does his absolute best not to smile, or show that he's getting any enjoyment out of Sherlock being cowed by a small elderly Beta woman, but truthfully, he was thoroughly enjoying it.

""Do I even want to know why you needed purple dye, or *when* you needed it... you've erm.. been quite busy the last few days.""

""The organs you got me."" Sherlock blushes.

""You are going to scrub my carpet and get these drips out. You're a chemist, you should be able to figure out how to get dye out of fibers."" Mrs. Hudson tsks. ""Tea, John?"" He leads John to the kitchen.

""Feeling better?"" The landlady asks, pushing John into a chair while she fills the kettle.

""Better.. yeah."" John stammers, remembering the taste of Sherlock's cock in his mouth. ""Just a short bug. Must have picked it up from the clinic.""

Sherlock goes about cleaning the carpet.

""Poor thing. Sherlock was so nervous."" Mrs. Hudson pours them both a cup of tea.

""Mmm, came on fast. New tea?"" John asks, attempting to steer the conversation away from his supposed illness.

Mrs. Hudson nods and launches into a whole story about how her usual tea wasn't available at her tea shop and the girl at the counter recommended this one. ""But I'm not sure I like this one."" She looks at her cup.

""I like it,"" John says, smiling kindly at the woman. He looks around her kitchen and spots an old photo of her, a few years younger posing beside a tall man with curly dark hair. Though his skin has some color, and his chin a little less refined, he recognizes Sherlock instantly. A thought comes to him, and he bites his lip.

""While his nibs is busy..."" John whispers, ""You've known Sherlock for a long time... Was it a surprise to you, to learn he and I were a couple? Has he had relationships in the past? He says he hasn't, and I'm inclined to believe him.. but.. You know, curious minds, and all that.""

""I've known Sherlock for a long time. He helps me with some sticky business with my late husband."" Mrs. Hudson sips her tea. ""I was surprised when he said he had someone. He kept the details vague, at first, I thought he was shaming. But then you showed up with him and I've never seen a better match."" She smiles. ""He's never brought anyone home or anything like that. Before he got clean.."" She thinks how to say it delicately.

Sherlock comes into the kitchen and gets swim cleaners from under the sink before going back to the other room.

""Before he got clean his brother cut him off from all the family money. I let him crash at a flat I owned on Montague Street so he'd have somewhere warm and safe to stay. Some people would come and go but they wouldn't stay very long. I realized that they were drug dealers."" Mrs. Hudson makes a face.

She gets up and gets some biscuits from the cupboard before sitting back down.

""I told him that if he didn't clean up his act that I wouldn't speak to him again. He told me he didn't care and said all sorts of rude things, which I don't hold against him. I know what drugs do to a person."" She nods, dunking her biscuit into her tea. ""He disappeared for about a week before coming back and begging for forgiveness.""

""Addiction is hard. But I'm glad he had you, Mrs. H.""

John sits and mulls over the information. He didn't know much about Sherlock's past, aside from that there had been an addiction problem. Then there was whatever was going on between Sherlock and his brother. Part of John just imagined that it was sibling rivalry, as only the Holmes knew how to display.

""I should go make sure he hasn't passed out from fumes. Thanks for the tea.""

Finishing the last dregs of his tea John stands and pats the landlady's shoulder. Going out into the other room he leans on the doorframe and watches Sherlock with a small smirk.

""Need any help, or can I just sit here and admire the view. And by view, I mean your arse.""

Sherlock blushes as he scrubs, from John's words rather than the exertion from scrubbing. ""It's starting to come up but I don't think they come out completely.""

""Mm, keep wiggling back and forth like that and something else is going to ... Oh, hello, Mrs. H. Sherlock's got the worst of it up,"" John says sweetly, hearing the landlady behind him.

She titters about, suggesting a few different cleaning chemicals before leaving the two men alone again.

""Do you get your trousers tailored to your arse just to impress me, or do you just like the way it feels, having them fit you like a second skin.""

John feels the growl bubble in his chest and covers it by clearing his throat.

""Sorry, I think I might still be a bit... ill""

Sherlock chuckles softly. ""I may wear tighter trousers around you than not."" He smirks a bit. ""Oh."" He looks surprised and looks up at John. ""Would you like to top?""

""Top... top what?"" John says, looking around confused.

""Me."" Sherlock stands. ""Would you like to fuck me, John?""

""Oh... top, as in.. in the bedroom.""

John rolls his head back, leaning it against the wooden frame of the door, and shrugs.

""That's all I know, aside from toys, I haven't had anyone inside me. Ever. Beta's don't care who's doing the work, as long as everyone has an orgasm. I've had sex, but only with Beta's, and mostly women. I guess.. what I'm trying to say in a very roundabout way, Sherlock."" John sighs and lifts his head up, locking his gaze with Sherlock's. ""I want to try it all. With you.""

Sherlock takes three strides to John and cups his cheek in one hand before leaning in and kissing him.

""Mmm."" John hums, dropping his hand onto Sherlock's hip, though he wrinkles his nose at the stink of chemicals on Sherlock's hands. ""Finish up here, and meet me upstairs.""

Pulling away from Sherlock he slides his hands over Sherlock's arse then heads up the stairs. He goes up the second flight of stairs to his room. He takes his favourite pillow and heads back to Sherlock's room.

Sherlock scrubs for a while longer until all the spots were just a light hue of purple.

John's heat isn't ready to give up the ghost yet. Sherlock helps him through one last aftershock.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


When Sherlock joins John in his bedroom, John has his pillow stuffed under his head and a nest of blankets wrapped around him. He smiles lazily up from his nest and pats the bed beside him.



""Joining me?""



Sherlock smiles softly and climbs into the nest. ""How are you feeling?"" He nuzzles John, holding him close.



""Tired, mostly, still a little... erm, horny for lack of a better word."" John leans into Sherlock's nuzzling, tilting his head back, giving the alpha access to his neck so he can be scented.



""I love smelling like you,"" he admits, rubbing the side of his face against the stubble on Sherlock's chin.



Sherlock scents John, kissing his neck gently. ""I like it as well. It's.. satisfying when you smell like me.""



He gently rubs his stubble against John's jaw, rubbing against his omega. ""Can I help with the horny feeling?""



""Mm, perhaps."" John grins, rocking his hips against Sherlock's body. ""What are you open to? Do you want to just... this,"" he asks, rutting his erection against Sherlock's. ""Or... I'd let you have me.""



Sherlock thinks as he kisses John's neck. ""I want to suck your cock and eat your arse."" He mumbles as he licks John's scent gland.



""God, yes... please."" John moans, rolling his head into his pillow, letting Sherlock's nose slide further back along his jawline. ""would you?""



""Yes."" Sherlock teasingly drags his teeth over John's neck before kissing down his body.



John kicks his pants off and pulls away from Sherlock long enough to tear his shirt off. ""Clothes... off,"" he mutters, pawing at Sherlock's shirt.



Sherlock chuckles and strips, naked over his omega.



""Sherlock.."" John sigh, their bare chests touching, ""I want you inside me, any part of you, please. Tongue, finger, cock. Show me what it feels like, please?""



""I'll fuck you later when your heat is gone for sure."" Sherlock kisses him deeply before moving down between John's legs.



John hooks his legs up over Sherlock's shoulders and settles back against the bed. Sherlock nudges his nose against his groin, his cheek sliding against his cock.



""Sherlock, more... please?""



John's voice is a low whisper as if he's scared that a full volume might scare Sherlock off.



Sherlock takes his time, kissing John's cock from base to tip, and watches John for his reactions.



John slams his head back against the pillow and arches his back. Sherlock's mouth is like wildfire, spreading across his cock, his tongue like hot flames, licking their way across his skin. He imagines that every touch leaves a visual mark, a brand showing that Sherlock is claiming his body as his own.



Afraid that, should anyone get too close and see the biological difference, John had (until now) avoided receiving blowjobs. It was one thing to fuck in dim lighting, another to allow someone's head to be inches away from the secret he'd been avoiding since his early teens.



John grips the sheets tight as Sherlock's lips suck in his crown, his tongue sliding along his skin like butter on warm bread.



""Sher..."" he gasps, rocking forward and trying to sink his cock deeper into the wet heat. But Sherlock moves with him, chuckling as he maintains the barely-there contact.



""Fuu.."" John tries to swear, but the word is lost in his throat when a slender finger glides over his entrance.



So close to his heat, the area is still loose and willing to accept the intrusion. Sherlock's finger slides inside, and John feels a wet rush of slick glide out of him.



""Ahhh."" he cries, tense muscles falling limp against the bed as Sherlock slips into the last knuckle, the back of his hand falling flush with his body. ""No. one... ever.. just you."" He tries to say, but Sherlock's tongue is circling the head of his cock, making John forget words, and how to breathe.



Sherlock rocks his finger slowly, cataloging everyone of John's reactions to each different movement. There was so much slick and he smelled so good it made Sherlock's head swim.




Focus, focus.




Sherlock looks up at John, his pupils blown dark as he slowly bobs his head to take John deeper into his mouth. Omega males usually had small cocks since they weren't exactly needed but Sherlock was still quite impressed with the side of John's. He loved the feeling of that hard velvet skin sliding into his mouth, the throbbing of John's cock over his tongue.



Sherlock pulls back just enough to kiss and suck on the tip as he slides a second finger into John's desperate leaking hole.



""For the love of God,"" John croaks, his hips rocking and bucking as if being controlled by someone else.



""If you don't fuck me while I'm still partially open, I swear to god I'm going to fall apart at the seams.""



Sherlock's fingers sink in deeper, the tips brushing over his prostate and he cries out in a broken sob.



""I swear, I can consent, I need this. I need to know what it's like to have an Alpha inside me. To have you inside me.""



Lifting his head from the pillow John looks down at Sherlock with pleading eyes.



""Please, Sherlock? Please, give this to me?""



Sherlock slowly pulls off John's cock, trying to think. He knew John was in the last grips of his heat. He knew there was still a possibility of getting John pregnant.



A strangled cry rips from John's throat at the loss of Sherlock's mouth on his cock.



He pushes himself up into a sitting position, dropping his legs from Sherlock's shoulders he gets on his knees and does the one thing he never thought he'd do.



He grabs Sherlock's face in both of his hands and begs.



""Please, Sherlock? I'll be a good Omega for you. It'll feel good, for both of us, I promise. Please?""



""I know, John. I know. Soon. I promise. I'll get the toys. I'll fuck you with the toys.."" Sherlock kisses John.



John growls in frustration and collapses back against the bed.



He watches, half angry, half turned on, as Sherlock slips from the bed and leaves the room without putting a stitch of clothing on.



When Sherlock returns, bag of toys in hand, John looks up from where he's curled up on his side and asks in a quiet voice, ""Why? Am I not good enough?""



""You're too good for me, John. That's why I won't risk screwing things up."" Sherlock says softly sitting on the bed and pulling toys out of the bag.



""Screwing what up?"" John's forehead wrinkles as he tries to catch up. ""What are you on about? How hard is it to shove a dick inside a wet hole?""



He eyes the toy Sherlock has selected and sighs. It's long and slim but has an inflatable alpha's knot around the base. He knows the type, having used them in the past.



It will do, but this time, he wanted the real thing, to feel Sherlock's warmth inside him would certainly be nothing like a cold and lifeless toy.



""I can still smell a bit of heat on you. Which means neither of us is thinking exactly clearly. It also means I could still get you pregnant.""



Pregnant The word crashes around John like a ton of bricks.



""Oh... shit... You're right, I wasn't thinking clearly. That hadn't even crossed my mind.""



John uncurls himself and sits up, wincing as his movement dragged slick across Sherlock's clean sheets.



""Thank you, Sherlock, for thinking of me.""



Shuffling on his knees he goes back to kneeling in front of Sherlock, this time resting his head on Sherlock's shoulder.



Looking up, he nudges his nose along Sherlock's jaw. ""Kiss me?""



Sherlock holds John close and kisses him gently. ""I would love to be inside you. Feeling your tight wet heat wrapped around my cock. But not yet. Soon."" He nuzzles him.



""Yeah, alright. I can wait."" John sighs, rubbing their noses together, then their cheeks.



He pulls away and lays back down, knees spread apart. But before Sherlock has time to move an idea comes to him.



""I can still have you inside me, just not... that way. Get over here,"" he pushes the pillows to the floor and wiggles a bit lower on the bed, ""Give me your cock while you fuck me. I can suck you off at the same time.""



Sherlock lets John situate him. ""I can suck you and fuck you with the toys as well."" He smirks.



""Oh, can you now?"" John grins, despite Sherlock not being able to see his face, and slides his hands from Sherlock's arse up his back as far as he can reach.



""Multi-task for me, pretty boy,"" he whispers, dragging his teeth across Sherlock's pale arse before dipping his head lower and sucking Sherlock's cock into his mouth.



At the same time, Sherlock's fingers re-enter him, drawing a half moan, half sigh from John's lips.



Wiggling his hips a bit, he angles his arse up and is rewarded by a spark of pleasure as Sherlock finds his prostate again.



Sherlock takes John's cock back into his mouth, sucking in time with his rocking fingers. Once he finds John's prostate he rubs it gently, continuing the motions that make John keen and tremble.



He picks up the dildo and warms it against his body first before rubbing the fat head against John's slick hole teasingly.



John's mouth is too full for him to properly complain. Instead, he growls and thrusts his hips up off the bed. The head slides across his hole then skitters over it.



Frustrated, he scrapes just the smallest amount of teeth down Sherlock's cock, and thrusts up into the wet heat of Sherlock's mouth. More, now please. He screams internally, his whole body vibrating with desire.



Sherlock chuckles around John's cock and starts to slide the dildo into his lover.



While not the real thing, it had been years since John had felt anything inside him. His whole body melts as the pleasure washed over him.



His movements become uncoordinated, his head coming to an almost complete standstill with Sherlock's cock still inside his mouth.



After several long seconds, when it becomes apparent that John either can't or won't move, Sherlock's hips begin to move.



With slow, but deep thrusts, Sherlock pushes himself, and the toy, inside John at the same time.



John feels full. Fuller than he's ever been before. That feeling, mixed with the still somehow coordinated movements of Sherlock's mouth, promising to bring him to a quick release.



Sherlock barely has the toy worked up to the knot when John begins to whimper, a poor communication to relay he was about to come, but the only thing he could think of.



Sherlock swallows around John's cock and presses the dildo deeper, pumping the knot steadily until it was stuck inside John. What John didn't know is that this model had a special attachment that also released fake cum.



Warmth floods John's insides as his climax takes over. His body twitches and shakes, but Sherlock's body weight holds him in place.



Something foreign and slick pulses inside his hole and with a muffled cry John comes hard against the back of Sherlock's throat.



He can feel Sherlock's knot, for the first time, begin to swell against his lips. John reaches up with one hand and wraps his fingers along the swollen knot, stroking it with his fingers as he rides out the last waves of his orgasm.



There's a growl from between his legs, and suddenly Sherlock's cock slips out of his mouth and lands on his chest with a wet squelch. Warm come oozes over John's chest and stomach, as the smell of Alpha finds a permanent place in his memories.



When he's done, he's thoroughly spent, and it's all he can do to wipe the back of his hand over his mouth, cleaning up saliva and pre-come from his chin.



Sherlock pants and takes a step back to catch his breath. He gently moves John into a more comfortable position on the bed, being careful of the dildo still locked in place. ""Alright?"" He nuzzles John, scenting him.



""Mmm,"" John manages, closing his eyes and letting Sherlock rub against the sides of his neck. His head rolls from side to side with the movements, but he's smiling lazily.



He clenches around the toy, imagining it was Sherlock rather than a dildo and nuzzles his nose against the side of Sherlock's head.



""You?""



""Quite alright."" Sherlock nods, sliding his fingers through his cum on John's chest. His inner alpha all but purring at the satisfaction of having his cum cover his mate.



""Mm, good,"" John says, closing his eyes and sighing.



""Don't want to wash it off..."" he sighs as Sherlock's finger traced circles in his come-covered skin. ""But I'm going to make a mess if I rollover. And.."" he wiggles his arse a bit, wincing as the toy shifts inside him and something slick shifts inside.



""Something tells me they'll be an even bigger mess when you pull that out.""



""My research indicated that the feeling of being filled with cum, even fake cum, helped with cramping as well as sexual craving. So I found a model that would help with that."" Sherlock hums. ""We could take you to the bath, that way any leaking would go down the drain when the dildo is released.""



""You just want to video me waddling to the bathroom with a cock up my arse."" John grins, cracking an eye open and drinking in the sight of Sherlock smiling down at him.



""Don't deny it. I know you want to.""



Sherlock chuckles and kisses John. ""It'll just give me more ideas for later if you have to waddle around with my cock inside you."" He smirks.



He gently bushes John's hair back. ""I'll carry you of course. Just don't make a habit of it. Can't let you get too domesticated of me. We still need that soldier edge for cases.""



John rolls his eyes, a gesture that is lost on Sherlock, who's already through the en-suit door to the bathroom. The sound of rushing water fills the room, and the scent of bath salts makes John shudder.



John tries to brush off Sherlock's offer, but strong arms scoop him up and carry him into the bathroom. He's gently placed in the tub. Warm water smelling of lavender and vanilla laps around his body.



Sherlock reaches an arm between John's legs and waits for John to nod. The knot is deflated, and the toy gently eased out of him.



John instantly misses the fullness. He whimpers slightly, but Sherlock is there, slipping into the water behind him.



His softening cock presses against the small of John's back as they lay there together in the warm.



When the tub threatens to overflow, John reaches up and turns the taps off with his feet.



""This is nice."" He sighs, nuzzling the back of his head against Sherlock's neck.



""I will admit I thought of joining you the other day in the bath,"" Sherlock says softly as he wraps his arms around John's midsection.



John laughs and shakes his head. ""I wanted to play with your hair... you sitting with your back against the tub. Those curls just... there.""



He places his hands over Sherlock's and relaxes into the embrace.



""I didn't want to like you. You were so arrogant, still can be. I felt like a science experiment, between having to pretend we were in a relationship down to the way you seem to look into my soul when you look at me.""



John's thumbs trace over the back of Sherlock's hands, the movement sluggish in the water.



""I thought any minute now, he's going to discover my secret. He's either going to pin me against a wall and bite me, or kick me out.""



""Instead, you surprised me, you showed your true colours. Showed me the kind man you try so hard to hide.""



Sherlock is quiet for a while. ""It's better if I'm brash and bold. It keeps people off-kilter. That way it's easier to see what's hidden when they're thrown and defensive. Why do you think Donovan always tugs her skirt down to cover her knees when she sees upcoming? Covering up is always more obvious than not."" He snorts.



He nuzzles John's hair, breathing in his scent. ""I.. I probably should have figured honestly but I was too caught up in being amazed that you actually decided to stay. I gave it three days, a week tops. But you stayed. You yelled back at me when I shouted at you. You made endless cups of tea. And helped me solve cases, catch bad guys. Saved my life."" He says softly, nosing behind John's ear.



""Course I stayed,"" John said as if that was answer enough.



""You gave me back a life full of adventure. After the army didn't want me anymore, I thought I was destined to have a life full of a forced bond, and a forced family.""



John subconsciously runs a hand over his stomach and shudders. ""Sherlock, how could I love my own children if they were forced on me. If I had no choice in having them? When I knew, if they presented as Omega's they'd be sold off after their first heat?""



He shakes his head firmly then sighs. ""You saved my life... There's a reason I held on to my service gun.""



Sherlock's arms tighten around John at the admission. ""You are your own person. You make your own choices. I'm just here to support you. Just like any couple."" He says softly.



""If we ever do have pups I won't allow them to be sold off. They'll stay with us until they go to university or whatever they choose. They'll be taught exactly the same. No difference between alpha or omega or beta. They'll each be given the same opportunities and support. We'll make sure they can defend themself no matter their secondary sex. I will not have our pups sold off like cattle.""



""I'd like that..."" John says then blinks, realizing how true his words were.



""Not now, but maybe in the future? Minds to teach, nurture, love? Almost sounds like a happy life.""



The water starts to get cold, but instead of getting out John leans forward and pulls the plug, letting some of the water drains out. Once half of it is gone, he puts the plug back in and turns the water back on.



Sherlock reaches for a bathbomb, and they watch as it fizzes and turns the tub a foamy blue.



""Did you ever think you could have that? A happy life?""



""Never,"" Sherlock says without hesitation. ""And then came you..""


John REALLY likes baths.

Mycroft steps in to make sure the legal side is taken care of...


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


It takes two more days for John to finally feel normal again. He wakes that morning to find Sherlock already dressed and pacing the lounge, his mobile pressed to his ear. 
Wrapping his dressing gown around him. John perks up his ears and listens to Sherlock's side of the conversation while turning the kettle on.



""No, Mycroft,"" and low growls are all John manages to hear. The conversation lasts until the kettle starts to boil, then Sherlock hangs up and lets out a frustrated growl. 



""Let me guess... he's sending a car to take us to the registry?"" John says while pulling two mugs out of the cabinet.



""Yes,"" Sherlock grumbles. ""And he wants us to go out to my parent's house for a bond contract signing party this weekend."" He presses against John's back in a strop, his lanky form heavy despite all his looks for malnourishment.



""Well, isn't that... nice?"" John says, then shakes his head. ""Nope, that doesn't sound right. That's not nice, that's torture. He's torturing us. Call him up and tell him to ship me back to Afghanistan. At least there the torture is expected."" John chuckles, and when Sherlock's chest vibrates against his and a low rumbling laugh fills his ears (then his groin) he nearly drops the tea kettle. The sound sends desire coursing through him like wildfire. 



""Well, we can make the car waiting, and we can file for an extension if we need to. That should give us time to draft our own contract. Plus, there won't be a bond until my next heat. Which could be months away."" John pushes down the pang of want with a regretful sigh.



""He's told Mummy."" Sherlock pouts. ""His mouth is as big as the rest of him. He only tells her things about my life so he doesn't have to tell her things about his. But he doesn't have a life. Just 'a small position in the government'."" He makes a gagging sound.



""I much prefer it when you gag on my cock."" John deadpans, making his mate hum in satisfaction. Shifting below Sherlock's weight to reach for the teabags before continuing, ""Then we go to your parents, and have the loudest sex we can imagine. Or just play a porno on full volume so they think it's us.""



""Why can't Mycroft just knock up some poor underling so mummy leaves me alone."" Sherlock gives a great big sigh.



John ignores Sherlock's strop. Instead, he turns around, nearly knocking over the steeping tea with his elbows and grins mischievously.



""Can I be a bossy arsehole to you in front of your parents? We can make them wonder if you've gone mad and have decided to attempt to bond with another Alpha.""



""Oh 

John

 you are a wonder."" Sherlock grins and kisses John deeply, pressing him back against the counter.



""That wasn't a no,"" John says in between kisses. ""You realize if you don't say no, I'm going to strut in there like I own the place.""

""Do it. My father will think it's hysterical."" Sherlock says with a laugh.



Placing his hands on Sherlock's hips he grins and leans up into the attention. For once, able to enjoy kissing without the pang of need pulling him down tho his most basic form.



""I don't care if the car is here now, I'm eating breakfast, and having a shower,"" John announces after a moment. Breaking from the seemingly endless waves of kisses he turns to place sugar in Sherlock's tea, and just milk in his.



""What breakfast food takes the longest to make?""



""A proper fry up. Eggs, bacon, sausage. The works."" Sherlock smirks, pulling the frying pan out and placing it on the cooktop. 



John manages to milk his time, making Mycroft's car wait nearly two full hours. When the clock announces it's just ten in the morning, he sighs and reaches for his coat.



""Shall we go sign my life away, figuratively speaking?""



""Mm, I suppose so. You could walk me around on a collar."" Sherlock wiggles his brows suggestively.



""As tempting as that is, let's not push our luck. Trying to draft our own contract is going to be uncommon enough as it is. I won't be surprised if they try and fight us on it. If we go in disrespectfully they'll deny any requests.""  John stops halfway down the stairs and smirks, ""But we can save the collar for your parents.""



Sherlock snorts. ""I suppose I'll keep you around."" He teases as he follows John downstairs. Climbing into the back of the car he started and rolled his eyes. Not expecting to see his brother waiting for them in the backseat. ""Mycroft."" He says cooly, as he sits. 



""Mind if we snog back here, Mycroft?"" John asks, climbing in and clambering over Sherlock so he sat between the two brothers. He turns his back to Mycroft, pressing his arse against the man's thighs, and grabs Sherlock's face with both hands.



Sherlock, who'd been reaching for the door to close it, stops halfway to the handle and freezes for a moment. Then, when John's lips meet his he melts and fills the back seat of the car with a low growl. His scent grows stronger and overwhelms the sour stench of Mycroft.



Smirking, John settles back and says, ""Better, now I can't smell his lemony arse.""



Sherlock snickers and holds John close to himself.



Mycroft rolls his eyes. ""Children.""



""If we're children, then what are you? A toddler in an overgrown suit?"" John snarks back, feeling Sherlock's chest heave as he suppresses his laughter. 
""Why are you even here? We're not signing anything today, just getting a draft form so we can come home and compose our contract.""



""As I am the elder brother I have legal responsibility for Sherlock and therefore you both need my signature for the registration. Sherlock's lucky he has me or else Mummy would have had to come down and do it."" Mycroft rolls his eyes.



""Ugh, you Alphas and your legal responsibilities. Always have to own someone,"" John groans, sticking out his tongue making a gagging motion with his finger. ""When will you learn that people are people? No matter what their bodies or parts look like?"" 
He rolls his eyes and resists the urge to let out a giant fart. Perhaps beans on toast hadn't been his smartest idea to have with breakfast.



""There's no point in having this conversation with you, though. Men like you think that men like me are trophies, who should find it their privilege to be owned and used. After all, isn't it our honour to provide Alphas like you children, to enrich your status in this world?""



""Mycroft likes to feel self-important because he hasn't caved to Mummy's begging to bond."" Sherlock hums.



""Dr. Watson, I have no care for what society thinks people are worth. I work within the confines of a crumbling system filled with idiots and imbeciles. If it made any difference to me the whole cast system would be done away with just to save me the paperwork. Do you know why this system was put into place? Omega's wanted legal protection and alphas wanted to perpetuate status, on that count you are correct. But omega's agreed to it because they were not allowed to work, to have jobs, to own land, or have any claim to their own offspring. Being married offered the opportunity to be bonded so someone who may care about them enough to give them the life they craved."" Mycroft sighs as he looks out the window.



""Your assumption however that only alphas benefit from this system is false. Secondary sex doesn't matter. Do you know that some of the largest sex trafficking, excuse me, I mean match-making services, are run by omega's because match-making is seen as feminine and omega work? They exercise the little bit of power they have over others of their kind. Before you talk to me as if you know every in and out of this system think of those who I have to work to protect from the deepest darkest rankest holes of our society. I care not whether you're an omega or beta or alien for all that matter. As long as my brother stays clean and alive that is all the concern I have."" Mycroft gets out of the car when they arrive at the office.



""Huh,"" John says, watching as Mycroft steps out. He turns to Sherlock and whispers, ""Who shoved a dildo up his arse."" 
However, even though his brief spat of snickers, he can't help but feel a tiny bit of respect towards Mycroft. His words, of course, were true. Ever Omega knew the rumors, knew about the trafficking. It was a ghost story told at night to scare Omega children into behaving. The big bad boogie man designed specifically for one gender. 
Still, John didn't let it upset him. They, unfortunately, were not his problem. Him, a lonely Omega, albeit military trained, wouldn't stand a chance against the world's biggest trafficking ring.



""Right... Let's get this over with then,"" he says, sobering up and stamping down his desire to snark Mycroft Holmes to death.



When they arrive at their destination he follows Mycroft into the building, Sherlock on his heels. Mycroft's presence alone grants them a private waiting room, where a young Omega, no older than nineteen, offers them food and drinks. When the three of them decline, the Omega departs and leaves them alone to wait.



""Let's get one thing clear,"" John says in a low and dangerous tone, ""If I'm signing anything today, I'm going to need to agree with every damned word written on that paper. No loopholes, no clauses, no surprises.""



""I've made it very clear that you have the same rights and sovereignty as my brother. You've both made that clean."" Mycroft nods. ""All we're signing today is that you're registering with my brother and intend to become his mate. That is all.""



""Mate..."" John sighs and rests his head up against the wall. He could go into a tirade about that word, but he knows it's just the stress of the situation putting him on edge.



Sensing his mood, Sherlock reaches out and places a hand on John's knee. The contact is enough to calm the worst of John's anxiety, though his knee still giggles up in down with restless energy.



""Just passing legal rights from the military to Sherlock,"" he says out loud to no one in particular. ""Probably not a terrible choice. At least this way if I get stabbed by a crazed lunatic on a case we don't have to wait for some General to come sign approval for medical aid.""



Sherlock rubs John's leg. ""It'll give you more rights as well.""



""Yes, you'll be able to go out after dusk without a chaperone."" Mycroft rolls his eyes.



""Never listened to that one,"" John admits with a shrug. ""But, I've done my best to pass for a Beta as often as I could.""



After a few more minutes laps by, a door opens and an older Alpha walks in carrying a manila file folder. He gestures to the party and leads them into a small office. There are only two chairs, but neither Sherlock nor Mycroft object when John claims one of the chairs as his own. 
John fights the urge to speak. While they are deciding his fate here today, he knows things will go a lot smoother for them if Sherlock explains their reason for being there.



""I'm here to register with my flatmate,"" Sherlock says.



The officiate nods and pulls a few pages out of the folder. John's leg starts bouncing again as the weight of the situation settles over him. Sherlock sits beside him, his fingers brushing against John's arm where it lays on the armrest.



""Before you ask,"" John says, the words heavy and greasy on his tongue. ""We're not bonding yet, we'll be waiting for my next heat. We're simply here to register, and transfer my legal rights from the military to Sherlock Holmes, the man I intend to be my Alpha.""



The official pulls out a sheet, an official registration form for both of them to sign as well as a witness. 
Sherlock reads it over and signs. 
John accepts the paper and reads over the wording carefully. To his relief, it's all straightforward, no hidden meanings, no fancy wording. Just straightforward legal terms transferring his rights to Sherlock. 
Gripping the pen far harder required, he signs his name, the nib pressing in hard, leaving an indent. On a separate form, he jots down the information of his CO, and is told that the office will take care of contacting the army on Sherlock's behalf.



Sherlock's nose twitches in annoyance, and in a cold voice, he corrects the man. ""Not on my behalf, but on John's.""



John preens a little bit, and puffs his chest out. 
They're stuck in the office for a while longer, having been asked to fill out a bonding plan, Which neither of them had given much thought to. Mycroft steps out of the room, giving John and Sherlock a few minutes of privacy as they discuss what they wished to write. In the end, they leave the form as vague as possible. Simple copying John's words from earlier, that upon his next heat, they intended to bond. 



""I believe we're finished here."" Mycroft drawls, having entered the room with the government official. He signs on the witness line, then hands the paper back for official recording. 



John stands first, and walks off out of the office without waiting for either Alpha with him to lead. 
He gets out to the car and breathes a sigh of relief. For the second time in his life John has just signed his rights away. But, for the first time, he wasn't dreading an invisible threat, one that loomed over him with every breath he took. 
Turning to Sherlock, when his Alpha catches up, he walks up to him and wraps his arms around Sherlock's back. ""Thank you, for what you said in there.""



Sherlock holds John close and scents him. ""I'm sorry he was an ass. Mycroft is ripping him a new arsehole."" He snorts softly.



""God, I loathe that the thought that I'll have to show him my bond bite."" John sighs and lets his Alpha mark him. Sherlock's scent soon washes away the other Alpha's scent and it makes him feel better. Helps ground him.



""Alphas just don't like seeing an unbound Omega..."" He glances over to the car, then looks up at Sherlock. ""What are the chances we can just get a cab home? Or we could walk? I want fresh air, and to see the city again. I've been cooped up inside for too long.""



""We can walk. Mycroft will have copies sent to the flat."" Sherlock takes John's hand, leading him away from the building.


Poor John :( Having to give up his basic rights. Breaks my heart a little. -Tindo

Sherlock and John take on a case just before bonding... Will they survive the tension?


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


Two months later Sherlock a letter from the gardener who tended to his great grandmother's estate shows up on their front door Hand-delivered by a courier, who stood and waited for Sherlock to read it and give his response. Sherlock's grandmother had some of the most awarded gardens in the French countryside. Not only that but she had several colonies of bees that supported her garden and the local vineyards. Currently, both were being threatened. 



""John! We have to go to France! Start packing!"" Sherlock says from the living room as he reads the letter. Someone had been poisoning his great-grandmother's garden and the bees were dying in droves. Worse yet, it didn't seem to be limited to just his grandmother's hives and property. Before consulting John, 
Sherlock buys them first-class flights for that night.  The sooner he and John get to his grandmother's the sooner they could start working on the case. With any luck, no later than tomorrow morning. would be able to settle in and get working on the case first thing in the morning. 



After two days of investigating it becomes apparent that it wasn't only his great grandmother's garden that was being terrorized but the surrounding vineyards as well all at the expense of the local pollinators. If there was one way to piss off Sherlock Holmes it was the senseless murder of bees. Sherlock
 sits at the breakfast table on the morning of the second day, watching John eat as he goes over the facts of the case.



""We've ruled out rival vineyards and local exterminators."" He grumbles, irritated.



""How are the bees dying?"" John asks, trying to shake to sleep from his groggy mind. ""They're dying because their source of food is poisoned, right?""



Sherlock nods once and growls.



""How easy is it to produce the poison they're using? Need they be a chemist, or can your local run-of-the-mill druggy who's good at mixing make it?""  Unsued to seeing Sherlock apply emotion to his cases, he's tempted to remind Sherlock to keep a level head. However, despite the angry growling and fretful hairpulling, he finds Sherlock's emotional side endearing.  Plus, t
here's something about the fire in Sherlock's eyes that makes John want to pull off every stitch of his clothing and kiss him better.



""Bees are delicate. Any run-of-the-mill pesticide can cause mass die-offs. That's why this is so frustrating. There are still too many variables."" Sherlock grumbles and crosses his arms. ""We'll have to go back to the vineyards and investigate again. I'll have to look closer at the hives.""



""Alright, but I'm finishing my damned breakfast first,"" John says, pointing his fork across the table at his Alpha.



Sherlock just rolls his eyes but doesn't tell him to hurry up. 
An hour later they're well on their way to the nearest vineyard. The overcast sky adds a gloomy feeling to the day. John finds himself focusing on Sherlock's scent in their rented car. 
The rental company did a good enough job of erasing the scent of the Alpha who drove it last, but pungent notes of stale seawater still find their way into John's nostrils.



""Give me your scarf?"" He asks, his stomach rolling. ""God he smells like low tide and rotting sea creatures.""



Sherlock takes off his scarf and hands it to John before unrolling the windows as he drove. ""Smells like they drove this thing off a pier and dragged it out six months later.""



They finally arrive at the nearest vineyard. Going through the building they wave at the manager who waves them to the back where the rows and rows of grapes were.



Sherlock walks between the rows, inspecting them. Then he goes to the hives. Out of the original five, only one and a half were barely hanging on. He couldn't see any damage to the hives themselves but there was a stain in the dirt.



Pressing Sherlock's scarf to his nose John silently follows Sherlock. He doesn't know what to look for but stays alert. 
Standing back, mostly to give Sherlock space, he paces a wide circle around the hives, listening to Sherlock call out facts. 
On his third loop around the hives a spot of yellow catches his eyes. Taking a handkerchief out of his pockets he bends down and lifts up a small yellow pin.



Only a little bit bigger than a large button, the pin is simple. It has a yellow background and ""Free the bees'' written in black ink. Though, to his puzzlement, there's a circle with a red dash drawn with what appears to be a marker.



""Sherlock,"" he calls, taking care not to touch the pin. ""I might have found something.""



Sherlock goes to John immediately. ""Save the bees?"" He sounds confused. ""Why cross it out?""



""Mmm..."" John mumbles, sniffing the air as Sherlock gets close. ""You smell nice.""



He passes the pin over, then steps into Sherlock's space and begins nuzzling his face along Sherlock's chest, sticking his nose deep into Sherlock's armpit where his scent is stronger. 
""I missed you, when you were over there. That's silly, isn't it? I could still see you."" 



Sherlock wraps his arm around John as he looks at the pin. ""Grandmama's house smells old and musty, not like Baker Street that's saturated in us."" He kisses John's head. ""We need to talk to the manager and see if they know about the pin.""



John whimpers when Sherlock pulls away. His chest feels warm from their contact, though it quickly grows cold as Sherlock walks away, putting distance between them. 
With a small growl, he chases after his Alpha and catches up to him, breathing a sigh of relief to have Sherlock and his comforting scent back by his side.



""Think the managers in on this? Or are you just hoping he'll recognize the pin?'



""Possibly. Let's see if we can jog his memory. He told us that no one is allowed on the grounds that doesn't come through the building and they have electric fencing but there are show prints in the dirt that don't match the workers boots."" Sherlock wraps his arm around John's waist and keeps him close. 
""Marco!"" Sherlock calls out. ""Have you seen this before?"" He asks the manager when he comes over, showing him the pin.



As John listens to the two men talk he becomes aware of a new feeling settling in the pit of his stomach. 
Doing his best to both pay attention to Sherlock and the manager Marco, he almost doesn't realize it for what it is. 
Desire. Not just the normal desire he'd grown accustomed to over the past few months of their relationship, but a deep seeded desire he could feel all the way down to his toes.  
He wanted to claim Sherlock, he wanted to lick every scent gland and mark Sherlock as his. He wanted to come in his hand and smear his come over Sherlock's skin so every unbound Omega that passed Sherlock would know he was taken. 
He begins humming the tune to Billy Idol's Cradle of Love. The words echoing throughout his mind, and seeming to vibrate across his soul.




Yeah flesh for your romeo



Ah yeah baby



I hear you moan



It's easy, y'know how to, please me yeah




Sherlock gives him a scathing look, but when their eyes meet understanding flashes between them.



""As you can see,"" Sherlock says to Marco while still looking at John, ""John's heat is...he's going to be very heated,"" he corrects himself, ""if we don't find these men.""



""Yeah, I only start humming 90's rock music when I'm angry,"" John says, doing his best to keep a straight face, which isn't easy when Sherlock looks like he wants to find the nearest dark nook and tear John's clothes off.



However, Sherlock is drawn back to the case when Marco tells them about a group of young hippies who came by a few weeks ago. He kicked them out because they smelled like weed, (bad for a reputable business) and they kept asking if the wine the vineyard produced was with slave labor. He told them of course it wasn't and that they needed to leave because they were causing a scene.



""Slave labor."" Sherlock mumbles curiously.



""Tell me you can solve this quickly,"" John hisses as they walk away, ""I estimate we have a day and a half two at most, before my biology kicks in.""



""We'll go back to the estate and I'll make a list of vineyards that haven't been hit who boast about their own hives. We'll have a stakeout at the most likely one and finish this tonight. Hopefully."" Sherlock nods.



John nods once and grimaces as he nears the car. ""God, what did he do? Have sex in the backseat?""



Sherlock opens his mouth, about to answer but John sticks his finger out and says, ""No. Nope I don't actually want to know.""



The ride back to Sherlock's family estate is quiet. Sherlock thinks while he's driving, which John can't imagine is safe, but without a license there's little he can do. 
When they pull up the gravel drive he says softly, half stating, half still expecting he needs Sherlock's permission. ""Think I can get my license? When we get back to London?""



""Of course, John. It'll be much more practical for you to drive so I can think. I'm surprised the military didn't let you get one. Probably didn't want you running away with all your newfound freedoms."" Sherlock rolls his eyes and gets out of the car.



""Oh I could drive. Military status trumps everything else. I've driven tanks, trucks, hummers... Even had a funny little golf cart to get around on base. But in the civilian world I need that pesky little licence.""



The car comes to a stop and John is more than happy to step into the fresh air. The late afternoon sun feels warm on his face and he sighs. ""Should have realized this was coming. Remember on the plane I said I could smell someone chewing gum? My senses are working overtime. I bet, if a bound Omega who isn't on the cusp of their heat, got close to the car all they'd smell is chemicals.""



""It's a month early. I thought we'd have time for this case. I'm sorry."" Sherlock says softly, feeling awful that he's dragged John to another country to solve a case and now he's going into heat away from their home.



""Yeah well, my system is out of whack,"" John falls into step behind Sherlock as they head into the large house.



""Kitchen?"" He asks thinking that he can make an early dinner while Sherlock works out which vineyards need their surveillance.



""I should have accounted for that."" Sherlock sighs. ""Yes you should eat.""



""So should you. We won't be eating much in a few days. We'll both need as many calories now as we can manage.""



John doesn't leave room for Sherlock to argue. He quickly sets about making dinner, opting to cook a frozen pizza over something from scratch. 
While waiting for the oven to preheat he begins going over a mental list of everything they'd need if he was going to have his heat here.  
Taking stock of the fridge and its contents he begins a list.




Water bottles



Cheese



Fruits



Nuts


Cured meats



Once he gets a list started it flows easily and it's taking up a full page in his notebook. Figuring he'd gotten the gist of it he pockets the notebook and turns to Sherlock.



""You said vineyards, plural. Makes sense if I take one, you take the other.""



""Logically yes it makes sense but you're also going into heat and I'm not sure I'm comfortable leaving you on your own."" Sherlock frowns, looking up which vineyards are most likely to be targeted next. 



""I have my gun,"" John shrugs as he puts the pizza into the oven. ""Wouldn't be the first risky situation I've been in.""



""Yes I know that but I'm also supposed to have your back,"" Sherlock mumbles as he presses against John's back, breathing him in.



""Mm, but I'm a big boy,"" John says, leaving back into Sherlock and resting his head against Sherlock's shoulder.



""If we want this over tonight we should split up. What's the distance between them? Can we stay in touch through walkie talkies?""



""The properties are neighboring but the hives are on opposite ends."" Sherlock wraps his arms around John, scenting him.



""I suppose we could. When we see something suspicious we could alert the other to come over for back up."" He says, still not liking the idea of leaving John.



""Relax, Sherlock,"" John says, turning around and falling into his Alpha's embrace. ""We've done this loads of times. I dare say London is a bit more dangerous than a field full of grapes after nightfall.""



Preening under Sherlock's attention, he forgets to set a timer for the pizza. Eventually, Sherlock pulls his lips away from John's neck and whispers in his ear, 
""Ding."" It sends shivers down John's spine, but he manages to pull away and reach for the potholders. 

Sherlock watches John take the pizza out and cut it into slices. ""Fine but the minute you don't feel right or you see something you tell me.""



""Superpower, remember?"" He says, pointing to his nose once the hot pan is placed on the kitchen surface. ""I'll be able to smell trouble coming at me, and can have you by my side in no time.""



Unable to find a pizza cutter, John takes a large knife and cuts the pizza, grinning as he says, ""Hell hath no fury like an Alpha's whose unbound mate is about to start his heat.""



""Exactly,"" Sherlock smirks, impressed with John's cutting skills. ""I don't think that should be as arousing as it is.""



""Good, then have a slice.""


Here we goooooo tomorrow's update starts a fun story plot!

The boys stakeout to see who's been killing the bees...


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


They wait until dusk has settled around them before they leave. John double checks, then triple checks his gun, before sliding it into a holster he has under his jacket. 
When Sherlock cocks an eyebrow at him, as if asking where on earth the holster had come from, John just shrugs.



""I like to be prepared. Should have seen Mycroft's men scrambling to get my gun on the plane. I nearly peed myself laughing. I figured, if I was going through the trouble to get this on board, I'd bring my full kit.""



""I need to stop looking at you so closely. Everything you do turns me on."" Sherlock licks his lips as he looks John over. ""You accounted for the time change and took your contraceptive, correct?""



""Mm."" John nods while turning the volume on his mobile phone to vibrate only ""Had to change the alarm on my mobile, but I've been careful. As long as you somehow get me to take it during my heat, there shouldn't be any major surprises in a few months.""



""I'll drug you for your own good."" Sherlock chuckles, making sure he has his tools of the trade.



""Wouldn't be the first time you've drugged me... But for my own good?"" Laughing John slides into the car and groans as the scent of past drivers assaults his senses.



""So. Just to recap,"" he says, buckling himself in, ""Hide, watch the hives. Alert you to anything suspicious. Keep my distance, and do not engage. I'll stand upwind of the hive, in case any of them are Alphas. Which should also aid me in



scenting them first, as long as they don't approach me from behind."" 
John pulls two walkie-talkies out of a bag by his feet and checks their batteries. 
""Only use these for emergencies, keep the volume low, and try not to check in just to ask me how I'm doing. We have our designated check-in times, once an hour on the hour. If either of us is a minute late checking in, we call the local police.""



""I love a military man."" Sherlock groans happily as he drives.



""Now who's the sex-happy one in this relationship."" John chuckles and can't deny that he's thoroughly enjoying the slightly glazed look in Sherlock's eyes.



Sherlock drops John off along the edge of one of the vineyards, as close to the hives as the car can go. 
John climbs out, then walks around to Sherlock's door. He motions for Sherlock to lower the window, then leans in.



""Be safe, yeah?""



""You, too."" Sherlock pulls John in and kisses him before scenting him liberally. ""Don't do anything stupid. I'm just a call away.""



""Out of the two of us,"" John says, smirking and pulling away, but keeping his head low enough that he can see into the car, ""Who's more likely to do something stupid?""



Sherlock looks like he wants to argue and then shuts his mouth with a click. ""I have nothing to say on this matter."" He pouts.



""That's what I thought."" John laughs softly, then taps the roof of the car. ""Get going, you. Pick me up around 1. I'm not sitting out here all night."" 
He slings the duffel bag over his shoulder and turns without another word. Dressed in black, his slight frame disappears into the vines almost instantly.



Sherlock watches John go until he's out of sight and then heads to his hiding spot. At nearly midnight Sherlock hears footsteps, at least three people. He gets in position, wanting to catch them in the act. 
The evening passes slowly. Dark settles around John and the damp that comes with it. 
He keeps his gun tucked inside his jacket, resting the urge to feel its comforting weight in his hands.



It's probably just kids... he reminds himself. To pass the time he circles the hive every twenty minutes. Making sure to keep his feet silent, while staying alert for anyone or anything. 
He startles a rabbit, but other than that nothing happens. Until midnight.



He was just about to pull out the walkie-talkie to contact Sherlock for their hourly check-in, when two bobbing circles of light break through the evening just south of his position. 
Two minutes earlier than their agreed check-in time, he whispers into the radio



""Two lights, just out of earshot, over.""



He slides his gun out of the holster and flicks off the safety. John Watson, the person, might not be in any real danger, but John Watson the Omega close to his first natural heat in years... might be.



""Shit."" Sherlock stills as all three heads whip around to his direction, John's voice was quiet but they still heard something.  
One of them moves closer and Sherlock decides since his cover is blown he might as well use whatever little surprise he has left. He jumps out and knocks out the one closest to him.



""What the fuck!"" Yelps one of the others. Sherlock goes after him next, his radio clatters to the ground in the struggle with the button pushed down by a rock.



""Bastard!"" The third growled and picked up a plank of wood, cracking Sherlock over the head. The sound was sickening and Sherlock could feel his scalp split. He managed to knock out the second with blood in his eyes before the third could land another blow.



Wiping blood out of his face he could see the shirt the third was wearing. ""Free the bees? What does that even mean? They are free."" He growls as they circle each other.



""They are not! Trapped in those boxes and worked like slaves! All their honey is taken and they're left to starve!"" He shouts back.



Sherlock stops, maybe it was the concussion or the blood loss. ""Do you not know how beekeeping works?"" He says, sounding utterly confused.



""THAT'S just a fancy name for slave master!"" The third snaps back.



""Oh for Christ's sake."" Sherlock rubs a hand over his face. ""You're a bunch of animal rights activist idiots who don't even under animal husbandry."" He sighs.



John's blood goes cold at the sounds coming from his radio. Voices had crackled through the speaker, voices that did not belong to Sherlock. 
Then there had been the unmistakable sound of Sherlock in pain before the device went completely silent. 
John knows better than to waste time calling Sherlock's name. Stuffing the radio into his pocket he withdraws his mobile phone and dials the local police, pleased with himself for putting the number in his contacts before they'd left the estate. 
He relays what's going on in hushed tones, backing up so the people getting closer to him will have less opportunity to hear him. 
Once he's done calmly relaying the information over to the dispatcher, he shoves his mobile into his back pocket and runs a hand through his hair, tugging at the ends.



Think Watson he tells himself, willing the pang of panic to go away. I didn't hear a gunshot, didn't hear a vehicle... But that was Sherlock's voice crying out in pain, I'm sure of it.



He cursed himself, wishing they were bonded so he could have a better sense of if Sherlock was alright. 
Realizing that the lights had grown close enough that he could make out dim shapes moving towards him, he raises his lips in a snarl and stalks forward, gun in hand. 
He takes them both by surprise, tackling one, a young beta woman to the ground. Without muttering an apology he slams the butt of the gun into the back of her head hard enough to knock her out, then turns the gun on the other, a young alpha barely old enough to need to shave.



""Sit. Hands on your head,"" he snarls, placing one foot on the throat of the young woman. ""Or I'll crush her windpipe."" 
He has no intention of doing such a thing, but what the Alpha didn't know, wouldn't hurt him.



Sherlock grumbles as he ties the three idiots together and makes sure they can't get away. He picks up the walkie and finds that it's crushed. John! His mind screams. If John had been calling for help he wouldn't have been able to hear it. 
Before Sherlock knows it he's sprinting through the vineyard towards where he left John. His head is pounding and his vision is a little blurred, running mostly on his instincts alone. 
Panic wraps around the base of John's skull, cold and slippery. Worried about his Alpha's fate, he almost misses the flick of anger in the young Alpha's eyes when he realizes he's being held at gunpoint by an Omega. 
Channeling all of his anxiety into anger, John pulls the hammer back and cocks his head.



""Oh, I wouldn't move if I were you. I bet you that my bullet can move faster than you. Is that a bet you're willing to lose?""



The alpha growls something rude, but his string of derogatory remarks falls of deaf ears as John escapes into his mind where he's instantly welcomed by his own fear, wondering what happened to Sherlock. 
Sirens carry across the wind. And while they're still far away, it reassures John that soon he'll be able to go and find Sherlock. 
As they grow nearer, his stomach clenches, the first waves of craps rearing their ugly head.



Sherlock nearly trips through the clearing. ""John!"" He nearly tackles his omega, checking him over to any injuries. ""Are you alright? Are you hurt? Did they touch you? Are you okay?"" He rattles off questions, not seeing any injuries on John and he doesn't smell hurt.



John struggles to maintain his balance, and his gun arm, while Sherlock feels him up.  
He lets his Alpha check him over, knowing that Sherlock needs it as much as he does. He doesn't dare take his eyes off the young Alpha, but he sees something dark and shiny in the moonlight on the side of Sherlock's face and he can smell blood.



""Fine, love,"" John says softly, his foot slipping and pressing down a little too hard into the beta's throat. He corrects himself, and winces, knowing she'll have a foot-shaped bruise in the morning.



""If you don't mind though, I'm crushing this poor girl's throat. Mind getting the cuffs out of my back and taking care of this young prick while I make sure I haven't crushed her windpipe."" 
He risks one quick glance at Sherlock and growls, ""Then I'll be taking a look at you.""



Sherlock nods and gets the cuffs for the young alpha. He forces him down face-first into the dirt when he tries the struggle. ""This will hurt you way more than it will hurt me. I'm concussed, bleeding, and you threatened my omega. I could kill you and no jury would convict me."" He hisses.



John feels his face heat at Sherlock's words. He nearly forgets why he was bent over the female beta as a desire to tackle Sherlock to the ground and have him then and there threatens to override his logical side. 
Down, Lizard brain he tells himself, quickly walking Sherlock through the events as the sirens got close enough that their blue flashing lights cast strange shadows over the vineyard. 
The beta shows no sign of waking, so John motions to Sherlock once he's done fighting with the struggling man, and points to the ground.



""Sit."" He says, not caring one once if Sherlock's posh trousers get ruined by dirt. When Sherlock is sat on the ground he kneels in front of him and pulls his mobile out of his pocket.



Using the flashlight app, he holds the light up to Sherlock's face. He checks Sherlock's eyes for response time, and makes a satisfied grunt, then tilts Sherlock's head to the side. 
There's a large bump, and in the center a small split where something blunt had made contact with Sherlock's temple. Digging through his bag he pulls out a small medical kit and a water bottle. 
By the time he's done cleaning the wound, voices can be heard making their way towards them.



""Not deep, won't need stitches,"" John says softly, dabbing some ointment on the gash. ""But I'll need to clean and bandage it properly once we're back. I need more light to make sure I've gotten any foreign material out of the wound.""



""Alright."" Sherlock nods and stands as the police approach them. He tells them the owners had hired him and John against vandals and details what happened. He tells them where to find the others who should all still be tied together.



After explaining again and again and finally signing statements they're freed to go. ""You want to drive or me?"" Sherlock asks when they get back to the car.



""No way in hell I'm letting you drive,"" John says, holding out his hand for the keys.



""That's what I thought."" Sherlock passes over the keys. ""Don't go too fast. I may vomit.""



""Then you can vomit out the window, please, and thank you,"" John says, tossing his bag into the back seat and sliding in behind the wheel. 
Thinking fast, he gets out again, reaches into the backseat and dumps the contents of his bag on the floor, then passes Sherlock the bag.



""Better than nothing,"" he says softly as he got back in and started the car. 

Taking care to avoid the worst of the ruts in the dirt road out of the vineyard, he pulls out onto the main road.  
He drives a little faster than the speed limit, but slows down around corners, keeping his eye on Sherlock the whole time.  
When Sherlock starts to nod off, he reaches over with one hand and shakes his shoulder.



""Nope, no sleeping. Not until I have a proper look at you. Stay awake for me, Sherlock.""



Sherlock grumbles and does his best to stay awake. ""I was worried..""



""And you think I wasn't?"" John snaps back, then sighs, ""I'm not mad at you. Mad at them, for making me think something had happened to you. Sod the bees, sod their movement... All I care about is you. If something had happened..."" 
He trails off, unwilling to let himself finish that thought.



""Apparently I'm extremely hard-headed."" Sherlock says softly and rests his hand on John's thigh.



""Git,"" John says fondly, taking his hand off the gearshift for a moment to squeeze Sherlock's hand. 
""Scaring me into an early heat... I swear you did it on purpose.""



""I would have rather had more time to gather supplies and not have a head wound."" Sherlock snorts. ""How are you feeling?""



""Fine..."" John says even as a wave of cramps makes him wince. ""I've probably got twelve hours or so... long enough for us to catch a nap, then I can send you off to the shops.""



The estate looms in the distance and John breathes a sigh of relief when the gate automatically closes behind them. 
He pulls the car right up to the door and turns it off. 
He leaves everything in the car, except his gun, then heads over to Sherlock's side and offers to help him inside. 
Sherlock lets John lead him to the bathroom where the lights were the brightest so John can inspect his head. ""It was a piece of wood."" He says, knowing John's thinking what hit him.



""Mm, I'll check it for splinters,"" John says as he gets what he needs. He washes his hands, then puts gloves on. ""Tilt your head to the light for me?""



John takes his time, picking out small pieces of dirt and wood, then washing the wound clean.



""It really isn't as bad as it looks."" He says happily, putting more ointment on it and gliding his finger along the undamaged skin below the wound.



""I can bandage it if you'd like, but it's an awkward place, and the bandage will probably just slide off while you sleep. As long as we keep it clean, and watch it for infection, I think it's alright like this. But, your call.""



""It's fine. We'll just leave it. It's stopped bleeding so that's a plus."" Sherlock hums, liking the feeling of John taking care of him. He rests his hands on John's hips and presses his face to John's chest, breathing him in.



""Off to bed with you, then... I don't think there's much risk of a seizure, but I'll stay up for a little while and watch you.""



Sherlock starts to complain but John cuts him off with a shake of his head.



""Sherlock, I'm going to need you rested tomorrow, and fed. I don't think you understand how bloody exhausting it is to have sex for two or more days in a row. Non fucking stop. If you think your body hurts now, from that crack on your head... god you're in for something else.""



""Fine."" Sherlock sighs and starts to strip off his dirty bloody clothes. ""Only because you asked so nicely."" He teases.



""Humph,"" John grunts, shooing Sherlock out of the bathroom with a smile.



He slips into the kitchen and gets a glass of water, then detours back into the bathroom where he pops two painkillers out of their packaging.



""You'll be taking these, while I take my no have babies pill,"" he says, passing the tablets and the water over to Sherlock, who was in bed, though he was sitting up.



Sherlock swallows the pain medicine John hands him. ""Hopefully they kick in soon. I have a splitting headache."" He jokes.



""Ha.. ha.."" John says in a monotone. ""If I had a quid for every time someone said that to me, we could retire on our own private island.""



Still he smiles, and sits on the edge of the bed, brushing a few stray curls from Sherlock's forehead. While his intention is mainly of comfort, he can't help but watch Sherlock's eyes for any sign of something worse happening.



However, the pupils don't dilate, and his gaze remains clear and focused. After a few moments, John leans over and flicks off the lamp.



""I'll be back in a few... Need a shower."" He says, leaning forward and pressing a kiss to Sherlock's uninjured forehead.



Sherlock hums softly, leaning into the contact. He's still holding on to John when John tries to pull away.



""Oi, Alpha..."" John sighs, leaning over Sherlock and nuzzling their noses together. ""Let me go so I don't stink like Seawater Alpha and that young pup when you finally bond me.""



Sherlock makes a face and finally lets John go. ""Infantile little shit he was. Surprised he knew where to find his cock let alone use it."" He grumbles.



""I mean, he was with a beta..."" John calls as he finally breaks free of Sherlock's grip and heads back into the bathroom. 
""You can't tell me you didn't smell his spunk all over her?"" 
John leaves the door open and he begins to strip out of his dirty clothes. 
""Might know how to use it, but not well enough to please an Omega.""



A soft chuckle reaches John's ears. It creates a pool of desire deep within John and he wonders if his estimate of twelve hours was correct.



""What are the chances we can get some supplies dropped off? I already have a list."" He asks loudly as he steps into the shower.



""I'll have someone deliver whatever we need. I'm not leaving you again."" Sherlock settles against the pillows.



John showers quickly, but takes care to wash every inch of his body, washing off all forging scents.

Finally a bond....


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


When he steps out his skin is a blank template, ready to be scented by his Alpha until their bodies absorb each other's unique scents. 
He finds Sherlock still awake, his notebook laying open on the table beside his phone. Smiling, knowing that their needs will be delivered in the morning, John climbs into bed beside Sherlock.



""Hey..."" he asks after a moment when Sherlock turns into him and inhales deeply. ""What do I smell like, to you? You're all.. posh things, like leather and rich scents. Caramel sometimes, especially when you're angry. Other times, when you're just laying on the sofa in your mind palace you smell like vanilla. Do.. do I smell good?""



Sherlock smiles softly and leans in, smelling over John's neck and chest. ""Mm when I wake you early for a case or in the middle of the night you smell annoyed, a sour lime type smell but also a little sweet because you know a case is on. When you're having a bad day or your shoulder hurts you smell like gun oil and cold wind."" He mumbles, pressing kisses to John's skin. 
""When you're happy or I've complimented you it's like freshly baked cinnamon rolls dripping with glaze. And when you're turned on by something I've said or done. It's juicy and meaty. Something I want to sink my teeth into."" He murmurs as he kisses John's neck. ""There's always a base of warm stone as an undercurrent, strong and reliable. 
So yes, in short, you smell very good."" Sherlock licks johns scent gland teasingly



John shivers and his breath ghosts over Sherlock's face. 
""I want you to... to sink your teeth into me. I want you to make me yours, and you mine. I want to feel you through our bond, a constant reminder that we have each other, no matter what comes our way."" 
John points to a spot on the right side of his neck, just above one of his scent glands. ""Here, where it will show above my collar, so everyone can see it. ""



""Mm who knew my omega was an exhibitionist,"" Sherlock smirks, licking and sucking on the spot John points out.



""Public sex is great, don't knock it until you've tried it."" John half says half moans, then in a more alert tone adds, 
""At one pm I need to take my pill, remind me tomorrow Sherlock. I have an alarm set on my mobile, but I think it's still in my coat pocket... and I don't remember where I threw my coat when we came in.""



""I'll remind you,"" Sherlock mumbles as he kisses John's neck.



""We'll need..."" John continues, trying his hardest to think through the overwhelming presence of Sherlock, ""breakfast. Something full of calories and protein without being too heavy. Eggs, with cheese or something, and lots of liquids. When your knot swells in me... stay with me. Just hold me through it. It won't hurt me as long as you don't pull out before it naturally goes down.""



Sherlock hums something and noses his way to the other side of John's neck, licking along the scar tissue on his shoulder.



""You're distracting me... You might have a headache in the morning, but..."" he flushes a brilliant shade of red and says hoarsely, ""my slick can cure it. It's designed to help an alpha heal, in case of injuries before a heat.""



""Isn't that convenient?"" Sherlock mumbles, pressing John into the bed as he licks his neck and chest, pressing his nose to his armpits.



""Is... is there anything else I'm forgetting?"" John says while gasping for breath. Sherlock's hair tickles his chest, his tongue is warm and wet as he glides over his body. 
Though not fully in the throws of his heat, his cock is hard and he doesn't need to look down to know that Sherlock's is as well.



""Mm heating pad for cramps,"" Sherlock mumbles as he licks John's nipple.



""I shouldn't need it. Not as long as you're here and willing to fuck me."" 
John winces as a cramp yanks the words out of his mouth. ""Oh... you mean for now... right.""



Sherlock nods and moves lower, kissing John's stomach. ""Let me get you a hot water bottle. The order should be here in the next hour or so.""



""Alright."" John nods and lets his hands slide from Sherlock's back. 
The bed seems empty without his Alpha, and he finds himself wanting to cry until Sherlock's footsteps head back towards the bedroom. 
John lifts his head and sighs at the sight as Sherlock comes back to him. 
Tall, pale, eyes flashing with lust, and his powers of deduction are focused on him, and him alone. 
Sherlock is like a statue of marble. Beautiful, elegant while at the same time hard and unmoving. 
John's heart raced at the knowledge that against all odds Sherlock was here with him now, willing to entwine their lives together in a way that couldn't naturally be broken.



""When I said twelve hours..."" John whispers, ""I might have been exaggerating.""



""I think I'm more than partially to blame for that."" Sherlock rests the warm water bottle on John's stomach and cuddles him.



""Good, then *you* can do something about it as soon as my body starts producing lube. Until then, get some sleep. We're going to need it.""



Sherlock nods and pulls John to his body, cocooning them in their blankets. He scents John, covering John in his scent. 
Once John would have thought it impossible to fall asleep while every inch of his body was being nosed and kicked at. But his body knew what was coming, and it knew he needed rest. 
He drifted off with Sherlock's nose brushing against his side around two am. He doesn't wake until the sun is well up. Opening his eyes he groans and attempts to sit up. But something heavy is holding him down.



""Oi... Need the loo."" He croaks, wondering if Sherlock got any sleep at all, or if he'd been up all night scenting him. But a glance at Sherlock shows half of his curls matted down and sleep lines on his face from the pillow.



""Loo, then food first,"" he says softly, doing his best to ignore how badly his body demanded he simply spread his legs and beg for it. 
He takes care of his physical needs quickly, opting for cold pizza rather than warm eggs and toast. He even takes the slice of pizza to bed with him, the thought of not being by Sherlock's side suddenly unthinkable. 
When the pizza is gone he starts to lick his fingers and looks over at Sherlock, ""I think it's time, don't you?""



Sherlock nods, pulling John back to him again. ""How would you like to do this?"" He nuzzles John, running his nose along John's.



""Your cock inside me should be fine."" John quips. ""Wouldn't you agree?""



""Really? Is that how it works?"" Sherlock snorts, running his hand over John's side.



""Usually, yes,"" John says with a laugh. He appreciates Sherlock's uncertainty. This is new for both of them, and while he isn't afraid of messing things up with Sherlock it is still a bit awkward. 
""Why don't we just... Kiss? I want you to embrace being an Alpha. Enjoy this, because my heats are the only time you'll be hearing me beg for you to fill me up.""



John lays flat on his back and pulls Sherlock on too of him. Sherlock's cock sits heavy against his thigh as he drags his hands down Sherlock's back. 
They kiss, slow and soft at first. Each of them testing the waters of this new situation. It's different this time, knowing that they'd come out the other side as a bonded pair. 
Slowly the kisses turn into rough love nips, Sherlock's canine teeth descend and scrape along John's jaw, across his neck. He sucks at John's pulse point, just beside where John said he wanted his bite



""Wait to bite me until you've knotted me. I hear it won't hurt me if you do it then.""



Sherlock nods, sucking gently on John's scent gland and snaking his hand down, reaching down to feel at John's slick.



""Oh god!"" John cries out when Sherlock's fingers slide over his hole. Sherlock chuckles softly, his voice coming out like melted chocolate. Rich and smooth.



Sherlock dips his fingers inside John, coating them in slick, then brings his fingers to his lips. 
John watches, his cheeks burning hot as both embarrassment and arousal course through him. 
Sherlock licks his fingers, sucking John's slick from them. 



""You taste so good. I bet you feel even better."" He chuckles, low and deep.



His big hard alpha cock pulses against a John's tight, eager to fuck his omega. He leans in and kisses John deeply, wrappings John's legs around his waist. He rocks his hips slowly, rubbing his cock against John's.



""Do you want me to fuck you, John? Sink every inch of my cock inside you? Knot you and pump my seed as far as it will go?""



""God, yes... Please, Sherlock. Be the first and only one to fill me with your knot.""



John rakes his fingers down Sherlock's back and groans. For the first time in his life, he feels the tip of an Alpha's cock press against his hole. 
However, instead of thrusting in and instantly claiming him, Sherlock hovers as if frozen in time. Their eyes meet and there's a hint of a question in Sherlock's expression.



""Take me,"" John grunts, thrusting his hips forward and crying out as Sherlock eases inside him.



""Christ!"" John shouts, his nails digging into the flesh of Sherlock's hips as a rush of slick pours from him like a waterfall. ""Oh.. my god.""



Sherlock slowly pushes all the way into him. He stills, letting them both get used to the feeling. He whimpers softly, never having felt anything like this before.



He pants, holding himself above John. He wasn't sure what to do. ""What do I do, John? I.. I don't know what to do."" He says softly.



His instincts tell him to rut and thrust and claim and while that may feel good he doesn't think that's good. ""I want to please you. Take care of you. What should I do?""



John softens his grip on Sherlock's hips and lets out a sigh. Sherlock felt amazing inside him, satisfying him like no toy had ever been able to satisfy. 
With a smirk, he closes his eyes and seeks out the switch that allows him to change the intensity of his pheromones. 
This close, and already connected, it takes less than thirty seconds before he can see the change in Sherlock's expression. His eyes cloud over and his mouth gapes open and his nostrils flare. 
Bracing himself on his right elbow, John hooks a leg around one of Sherlock's and flips them with ease so he's on top. 
He places Sherlock's hands on the iron bars of the headboard and wraps Sherlock's fingers around the bars.



""Hold that, and don't let go."" he says in a seductive voice, bending low and hovering his lips mere centimeters away from Sherlock's lips.



When Sherlock leans forward, attempting to press their lips together in a kiss, John plants a hand on Sherlock's chest and pushes him back to the bed. 
With one hand braced on Sherlock's chest, the other on the headboard, John gets one leg underneath him and begins to fuck himself on Sherlock's cock. 
He wants to touch himself or have Sherlock touch him. But he doesn't, he denies himself touch, curious to see if he could come just from riding his Alpha's cock.



""When your knot swells, you can let go."" He says through heaving gasps for air as he bounced up and down, taking Sherlock's cock fully into himself with each thrust.



Sherlock moans as he watches John, enraptured by his omega. He plants his feet on the bed and thrusts up when John comes down.



""My omega. Mine. So hot. Perfect. Mine. Mine always. Just for me. I'm yours, John. All yours. Always. Hate being away from you. It hurts. Makes my insides cold. Don't leave me. Please. I'll be good. I'll be so good to you. Whatever you want it's yours. Whatever you want to do I'll support you. Anything. Anything."" He rambles.



""Mine...""John growls back, his body arching as Sherlock's cock slides over his prostate. ""My Alpha... Mine. Fuck me like you want me.""



The nails of his left hand dig into Sherlock's skin, not hard enough to draw blood, but they leave red welts along Sherlock's pale skin as his hand slides from Sherlock's collarbones to his stomach.



""I'm going to knot you and bite you. Bonding us. Keep you with me. Always. So good John. You feel so good."" Sherlock groans, rocking deeper.



His instincts are telling him to pin John underneath him and take everything he can. He ignores them in favor of watching John fuck himself on his cock. 
John's thighs begin to burn, but he ignores it. His physical discomfort is nothing compared to the pleasure he's getting from his Alpha. 
Sherlock's words sink deep into his mind. Creating a memory that he knows will last a lifetime. 
He pulls his right hand down from the headboard and places it on Sherlock's chest, crying out as he fucked himself harder on Sherlock's cock.



""I'm, God I'm close. Oh god, please, Sherlock.. now.""



In one swift calculated move, Sherlock turns them over and somehow keeps the pace John had going. He sinks his fingers into John's hair and gently tugs his head to the side. 
Sherlock's knot starts to catch and with one snap of the hips, he knots John and sinks his teeth into the spot John had pointed out, bonding them together. 
There's no fear, no last-minute regret, or any negative thoughts. John lets Sherlock pull his neck to the side, and watches with hungry eyes as his Alpha surges forward. 
The slightest pinching sensation registers in John's senses, but it's no worse than a shot, or getting a sliver. Though he feels muscles tear as sharp teeth sink into his neck, he doesn't cry out with pain or have flashbacks of the bullet sinking into his shoulder. 
Instead, he moans, and with hot pulses comes against Sherlock's stomach. He can feel Sherlock, just inside him physically, but in his mind. 
There, inside him, is a piece of Sherlock floating in his consciousness. He can feel Sherlock's emotions, feel the pleasure his Alpha is receiving from his body. 
Sherlock's tongue laves over the area between his teeth, his saliva numbing John's neck. He nuzzles the side of his face against the top of Sherlock's head and whispers.



""Finally... there you are."" John breathes, running his hands through Sherlock's hair.



Sherlock gently licks at the bites, his instincts telling him to clean and heal his mate. ""Okay?"" He mumbles softly.



""Quite alright, actually."" John grins lazily as his hands roam across Sherlock's back. 
""Did... did you come? I admit I was a tad preoccupied to notice.""



He wiggles his hips, testing the feel of his first knotting experience. With a grin he pushes back against Sherlock, pushing the knot deeper inside him.



""So much better than that toy. I can feel your heartbeat pulsing through your knot.""



Sherlock groans as John pushes back against him, squeezing more cum from him. ""It would be next to impossible not to come with you."" He chuckles a bit breathlessly.



""How does your neck feel? It's not bleeding too badly."" He asks, looking at their bond mark and feeling a swell of pride.



John purses his lips and rolls his neck from side to side, then shakes his head.



""Fine. I can hardly feel it. Well,"" he says softly, ""I can feel it, but there's no pain. I can feel you, like you're a part of me. Like... oh god, you're my jiminy cricket.""



John starts to laugh, deep laughs that leave him gasping for breath. He can feel Sherlock's pulse inside him with every shake of his body, but he can't stop.



""You're the bloody cricket telling me what to do.""



""The feeling is mutual."" Sherlock chuckles softly, nuzzling John. ""It's nice. I.. I like it.""



John's emotions level out and come back to some sense of normal. He stops laughing, wiping a tear from the corner of his eyes, and apologizes. 
""Sorry... I've read that Omegas can get emotional after a bond. but... I didn't think they meant I'd be laughing my arse off while I have a cock shoved up my arse.""



""It's alright. I like hearing you laugh. And it squeezes my knot."" Sherlock snorts, relaxing.



""I'm probably crushing you. Do you want to roll over so you can lay on top of me?""



""No... no.. I like this. You feel nice on top of me."" John says while nuzzling around Sherlock's neck. He smells like sweat and sex, but now underneath the scents John had come to think of as Sherlock there was something new. Something sweet, like coming home to find freshly made baked goods waiting for you on the table. 

When you're happy or I've complimented you it's like freshly baked cinnamon rolls dripping with glaze.




""Ohhh..."" John sighs, breathing in a lungful of the new scent. ""Oh... I.. that's me, mixed with you, isn't it?""



""It's you."" Sherlock smiles softly and kisses John tenderly.



""Fantastic..."" John mumbles around soft kisses.

They lay like that for some time. Eventually, Sherlock is able to pull free. He moves away, though he doesn't move far, and lays on his side watching John.

Slick and Sherlock's come oozes out of John. For a moment he wants to reach for a flannel and clean himself off. But he's hard again, and he knows Sherlock won't be far behind.

""This time... be rough with me. We can test how sturdy this bed frame is."" Rolling onto his side John reaches out and begins coaxing Sherlock's erection back to life with his fingers. ""Is it even a first heat if something doesn't break?""

""I'll take you properly this time."" Sherlock groans, his cock thickening at John's touch. He kisses John again and presses him back to the mattress. ""If it's too much just let me know."" He mumbles against his lips.

Sherlock kisses him some more and decides he wants John's on his hands and knees to take him from behind. Or maybe he wants to pin him to the wall and fuck him hard enough to makes the frames on the wall rattle. ""Would you rather I take you from behind or hold you up as I fuck you against the wall?""

""Why not both?"" John says as his heart flutters in his chest. ""Why not... against the wall, first? Before we're too tired to stand up?""

""Mm good idea,"" Sherlock smirks and gets up. Before John can protest Sherlock scoops John up. He carries him a few steps and presses John to the wall.

Sherlock kisses John deeply and wraps John's legs around himself. ""You may want to hold on."" He growls softly and slowly pushes his cock into John's slick dripping hole.

""Fuuucckkk!"" John cries and throws his arms around Sherlock's neck for support.

""So fucking big..."" John growls, dragging his teeth over Sherlock's exposed neck. ""So hard inside me. God, it feels so good. If only you were there, during my first heat.""

""I'll take care of you through the rest of them. You'll have my cock deep inside you making you feel better. Fucking you through your heat."" Sherlock slowly starts to thrust until he feels John relax and then sets a deep steady pace.

Sherlock's body is coated in a sheen of sweat, which allows John's cock to glide smoothly along Sherlock's stomach with every thrust. He leans his forehead against his Alpha's shoulder and begins to chant a series of curses and praises.

""Fuck, fuck... oh god, yeah, right there... Don't stop, Sherlock. God,"" he pants out. Suddenly he's overcome with Sherlock inside his mind. He can feel Sherlock's pleasure as if it were his own. With a tiny yelp, he comes hard, his cock trapped between Sherlock's writhing body.

Sherlock keeps thrusting, his knot filling out. He presses John harder against the wall and knots his mate, filling him with more hot come. He pants and holds John up, pressing kisses to his neck and shoulder.

""Mine,"" John says, pressing open-mouthed kisses to the pale expanse of Sherlock's neck.

""Mine,"" he repeats, scraping his teeth over Sherlock's scent gland.

""Mine,"" he says for the third time, then, without thinking, sinks his teeth into Sherlock's neck.

He's met with no resistance, despite his teeth not being sharp like an Alpha's. It's like Sherlock's scent gland had been made purposely with John's teeth in mind. John can feel the change instantly. His awareness of Sherlock becomes sharper. He can see the world in a different colour. Gone are the shadows of history as he looks around the room.

The carpet is worn in a line, and his mind instantly knows it's from ceaseless pacing. There are divots in the rug from where the bed had once sat two feet to the left. He isn't sure how he knows... he just knows. Slowly, he pulls his teeth out of Sherlock's skin and arches against the wall. Sherlock's neck is bleeding, and he knows what he needs to do to stop it.

""Bed... bed, now."" He hisses, pushing away from the wall with his elbows.

Though dazed, Sherlock stumbles back a few feet. Once Sherlock is flat on his back, John sits up and reaches behind him. He slides his fingers through his cheeks, and they come back coated in slick and come.

The doctor in him screams that this is wrong. That he needs to clean and dress the wound, then apologize for inflicting such a wound on his Alpha. But the Omega in him takes over, bashing the stupid doctor on the head and telling him to shut up. John places his sex-covered fingers over the wound and rubs their combined juices into the bite. Instantly it stops bleeding and part of his mind relaxes. He rubs a bit more in, then leans forward and begins lapping at the mess, cleaning Sherlock's neck until he's gotten most of the slick cleaned up.

""I... sorry..."" he mutters, ""Don't know why I did that.""

""Don't.. apologize."" Sherlock pants. ""Perfect. So good. I.. you."" He mumbles, overwhelmed by the new feelings and sensations. He can feel where John's body is sore, rubbing his hands over the spots and working out the strain. ""It.. You. You're in my head. I can.. I can feel you.""

""I... I can think like you..."" John screws up his face at the onslaught of thought. ""Sort of. It's... deafening. Is your mind always this chaotic?""

""Yeah. Sorry. Here."" Sherlock scents John, rubbing his face along John's scent glands. He knows how much John's scent helps calms his mind so he hopes his scent does the same for John.

""Oh... oh that's better."" John sighs as his mind calms down a bit. ""Sherlock... what happened? Is that because I... I bit you?""

""I think so."" Sherlock hums, gently pressing kisses to John's skin. ""I've never heard of an omega biting an alpha back. I'll do some research later."" He mumbles.

He can feel the heat from John's body, the need, and the longing. ""Having me close does help you, doesn't it?"" He asks softly, sounding surprised that he actually helped John feel better.

""It... it just felt right. One moment my brain was telling me that you're my mate. The next.. my teeth were sinking into you like your skin was made of butter.""

John nuzzles down against Sherlock's body, whimpering a bit when Sherlock finally slipped out of him.

""There's no pain, no cramps... I don't even feel sex-crazed. I just feel... happy. Like we've just decided to take a few days off to have sex for the heck of it.""

Sherlock chuckles softly and stills when the doorbell rings. He growls before remembering it's their order. ""I have to go get our order."" He kisses John before getting up.

""Bring me back a snack,"" John asks lazily, curling up on his side and dragging the blanket up over him.

""Of course."" Sherlock nods and pulls on a robe. He goes down to the door and collects the order, ignoring how the delivery boy looks at him oddly.

After putting away the things that need to stay cold, he carries snacks up to John. ""Here, John. Drink."" He passes him an electrolyte replenishing drink as he opens a package of jerky.

""Fuck... I was thirsty..."" John pants after downing the bottle in two gulps.

""You should drink one as well. Then... come here. I have a sudden desire to suck on your neck until the skin is purple beneath your bite..""

Sherlock stuffs a piece of jerky in front of John's face with a look that says Wait

""Fine.. fine.. I'll eat something so I don't pass out. But... I did just have a slice of pizza..."" he looks at the clock,"" Three hours ago.""

""And you've already burned that off from sex. Eat and drink and then you can do whatever you'd like to me."" Sherlock drinks another bottle, the cold liquid hitting his stomach.

""I was rather hoping,"" John says, sinking his teeth into a piece of jerky, ""That you'd have your way with me..."" He blushes scarlet, then continues, ""I want to be thoroughly taken... I want you to have every ounce of me, Take me like the Alphas in the movies, Sherlock.""

Sherlock raises a brow and considers it. ""Alright. I suppose I can loosen the reins a bit on the alpha side.""

He sits in the bed and opens a pack of chocolate-covered almonds. ""I'll call you my dirty little omega. Made for my cock. How you gag for my cock. How desperate you are for me. How you're gushing slick for me.""

A shiver runs down John's spine. With wide eyes, he nods his head.

""Just for you..."" he says softly, pinching a nut from Sherlock's palm. ""I want those things, just from you.""

Sherlock leans in and nuzzles at their bond mark. ""You waited for me. Just for me, omega. You knew I'd find you eventually. Make you mine. Bond you. Knot you."" He mumbles. ""Love you.."" He adds softly.

John's heart stops beating for a moment then he lets out a long drawn-out sigh.

""Love you too. I'm glad you're my first. This is so... intimate. I can't imagine spending a heat with someone, then having to just... casually see them around.""

Sherlock closes his eyes, memorizing John telling him he loves him.

He hums and nods. ""It's too much almost. So many feelings and thoughts and sensations. Yours is.. comforting. Knowing you. Hearing you. I can't believe people can do this with total strangers.""

""Neither can I,"" John says, shaking his head. ""The risk of coming through bonded besides the fact... It's one thing to have sex, another thing to actually crave a cock.""

John dips his hand into the bag of jerky and takes out another piece, then pushes Sherlock to the bed. He pops the jerky into his mouth and straddles Sherlock's hips.

""Need you, now...""

""Oh? Do you?"" Sherlock chuckles as he watches John chew. He reaches down and strokes John's cock. ""My horny little omega. So needy for me. For my cock.""

""I don't just need your cock, Alpha... I need you to fill me with your cock and seed. Someday I'll beg you to pump a pup into me... for now..."" John pants, sliding Sherlock inside him. ""For now, fuck me like you're trying to breed me anyway.""

Sherlock growls softly and rolls them, pressing John to the bed and kissing him deeply. ""You want that? To carry my pup? To watch your body swell and grow my offspring?"" His words are a growl, deep and demanding. This, talking of pups, makes his alpha howl and want to rut, to breed his omega. ""You'd look so good carrying my whelps. Watching you waddle around the flat. Nesting and preening. So pretty for me. I'll make you fat with my pups. You love it. Built for it."" Thrust after powerful thrust he delivers.

""Oh god..."" It's all John can do to brace himself against Sherlock's chest. He hunches forward and lets his Alpha take him. Suddenly Sherlock's hands are grabbing his hips and he's being pulled off before his Alpha can knot him. John whimpers, and begins to protest. But he's shoved roughly onto the bed, where he falls face first. Strong hands grip his hips once more, lifting his arse up into the air. John gets the hint, and shuffles his knees underneath him until he's kneeling, then Sherlock's cock is back, hot and heavy, and thrusting deeper than before.

""Fuck"" John shouts, his voice echoing off the walls.

""My omega. Mine. Bonded to me."" Sherlock grips John's hips, pounding into him fast and deep. He angles his thrusts to rub John's prostate as he wants to fill the deepest place he can inside John.

""You want that, don't you? For me to knock you up. You're made to carry my pups."" He thrusts harder, the headboard slamming against the wall.

""Oh god... two or more at once... Yes..."" John pants out, his voice is broken and raspy. ""Alpha pups, Omega pups... inside me. Please Sherlock... fill me.""

""Come. Come for me, omega, and I'll knot you. Fill you with my seed. Make you swell."" Sherlock growls and leans over John, nipping at his ear.

""Yes..."" John breathes. He ruts his cock against the bed, finding just enough friction to come. He cries out Sherlock's name, his muscles clenching around his Alpha and collapses against the bed

Sherlock drives his knot into John and comes hard, his cock pumping his seed deep into John.

Once he catches his breath he pulls back a bit and lays them on their side. He holds John close and kisses his back. ""I've got you. I'm right here."" He says softly, something telling him to reassure John.

""Mmmmmm..."" John hums, resting his back against Sherlock's chest.

""This is nice too... But I do like Big Bad Alpha... it's kind of hot.""

""I'll work on the persona."" Sherlock chuckles softly.

""How would we do this... my heat, if we had kids?"" John wonders aloud as they lay there. ""I wouldn't ask Mrs. Hudson to watch them.. not for days on end. And I'm sure as hell not leaving them to roam the flat on their own, or send them off to daycare...""

""Molly and Lestrade could help."" Sherlock hums. ""If we get desperate there's Mycroft."" He grumbles.

""What about your parents... when we were there for the party, your mother said something about babysitting..."" John had rolled his eyes at the time but now, it was a real consideration. Accidents could happen, and he'd certainly been filled with more than enough come to get him pregnant.

""What time is it? I need to take my tablet soon I think.""

Sherlock looks at the time. ""Twelve minutes."" He hums. ""I suppose my parents could. If we have pups your heat will be delayed until they're weaned.""

""Oh god, I'd get breasts...well, sort of."" John groans, then he stops as a flash of desire that's not his pulses through him. ""Really? It would turn you on if my nipples puffed out with milk?""

Sherlock blushes a bit. ""I may have considered suckling."" He mumbles.

""Hmm... well."" John laughs, a bright and crisp sound in the stillness of the house. ""We'd need a bigger place, eventually. What if I have four the first go? God... my hips hurt just thinking about it.""

""We can't leave Mrs. Hudson on her own."" Sherlock frowns. ""My grandmother did leave me a large estate outside the city.""

""Then we take her with us, and hire a property manager for the flat... we'll fix up upstairs..."" John stops and slaps a hand over his face. ""God, I'm pre nesting... I'm sorry. I think my hormones are just completely haywire.""

""You've nothing to apologize for."" Sherlock nuzzles behind his ear. ""It's good to have a plan just in case. Besides we have time before we want pups."" He hisses softly as his knot goes cock, his cock slipping free.

""I'll get your pill. We can take a shower and I'll change the sheets."" Sherlock gets up and gets John's pills.

""Jesus..."" John looks down at the state of the bed for the first time and gapes. ""There isn't a dry patch to be found...""

When Sherlock comes back he already has the sheets stripped and balled up in the corner of the room. He takes his tablet, and downs another bottle of water, then drags Sherlock into the bathroom for a much needed shower.

""Just... two more days of this. Hopefully just two more days of this."" He says, as hot water hits his face.

""I'll be here with you however long it takes."" Sherlock says softly and starts to wash John's body, being gentle with the tender spots and making sure John is clean.

Here begins our fun little plot twist!

Sherlock and John head home from the case newly bonded...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

London is a breath of fresh air as John steps out of the rental car. Everywhere he looks, he sees the city with a hint of how Sherlock must see it. People are more defined, their emotions on display for him like actors overplaying their roles.

He grabs their bags out of the boot and winces. His muscles are sore, and he has more than a few scrapes and bruises. Sherlock is no better.

Between the left half of his forehead being one giant bruise, and the fingernail marks John knows are beneath his well-tailored suit, neither of them are 100%.

But still, they share a smile as they pass the keys to the guy from the rental agency.

""Home,"" John says, shouldering his bag and looking up at the flat and sniffing the air. ""Mrs. Hudson is baking. Scones, I think... Did you tell her we were on our way home?""

""I called her this morning when you were making sure everything was in the car."" Sherlock nods. He resists the urge to take John's bag, knowing John wouldn't like him taking it, implying that he can't handle his own luggage.

""I suppose we're going to have to tell her we bonded."" Sherlock hums, knowing that even though Mrs. Hudson is a beta she's still smart as a whip and she'll figure it out just by looking at them.

""I suppose we should. This is rather noticeable,"" John says tilting his neck to the side and showing off his bond mark. It rested just above his collar, and while his coat partially hid the mark it would be quite obvious once his coat was taken off.

John feels a rush of pride surge through him from the bond and smirks when a low growl resonates in Sherlock's chest. He loves the way his Alpha feels when he sees the mark. It makes him feel safe and cared for.

""Let's get these upstairs and we'll tell her when she comes up to investigate how our trip went."" John suggests, wanting to put the case down once and for all to give his abused muscles a break. 

They head upstairs. Out of habit John heads towards the room upstairs but stops and turns to look at his mate. ""Seems a bit silly to have separate rooms now, if we're bonded. Don't you think?""

John had spent a good portion of the last two months in Sherlock's room, though they still maintained a bit of distance. When Sherlock was working on a case, or simply restless, John would go upstairs so the Alpha could prowl the flat without fear of waking him.

Sherlock nods. ""We'll use the downstairs room for sleeping and whatnot since it's on the main floor and close to the bathroom. The upstairs bedroom will before storage and loud sex."" He smirks and tugs John to the main floor bedroom so they can put their things away.

After everything is put away Sherlock hears Mrs. Hudson's familiar footsteps on the stairs. ""Yoo-hoo! Boys? Are you decent?"" She calls.

""Yes, Mrs. Hudson. Come in."" Sherlock chuckles softly, wondering if John can feel the warm feeling Mrs. Hudson gives him.

John steps out of the bedroom and watches their landlady closely. It takes her less than thirty seconds to see the bite. Her eyes go wide and Sherlock has to step to her side and take the tray of scones from her before they fall as she brings a hand up to cover her mouth. She looks from John to Sherlock, then back to John's neck. Having spent so many years running from his biology John feels a prickle of anger pulsing through him and he clenches his jaw. But then something warm and comforting passes through the bond and he's relaxing. Their landlady utters a noise that's half squeal half shock. But then she gathers herself, takes motions for Sherlock to put the tray down on the table.

""Sick..."" She mutters, remembering Sherlock's excuse from John's last half heat. ""Sick... Mhm. I was a fool to believe that one.""

""It wasn't my information to tell,"" Sherlock says softly. ""And you know John is still John. This doesn't change anything."" He says even though she's the one who taught him that everyone is equal no matter their secondary sex classification. ""Well I mean all that's changed is I'm his mate now."" Sherlock smiles proudly. ""I'm John Watson's mate.""

""Yeah, he's my mate."" John repeats then reaches for a scone. ""And thanks to him I'm starving. We didn't exactly stop to eat much the last few days.""

""I fed and watered you as much as you'd allow me to."" Sherlock snorts and turns in the kettle.

""I'm just happy you boys finally figured things out. I was so worried you'd never get here."" Mrs. Hudson coos.

""Wait..."" John turns and brandishes his scone at the lady. ""You knew. You knew I was an Omega. How? Even Sherlock didn't know at first.""

""John, dear, when your husband runs an international drugs and weapons transport ring you learn how to tell if someone's hiding something very quick."" Mrs. Hudson smirks.

""I'm sure the exotic dance career has nothing to do with it."" Sherlock quips.

""Bite your tongue, young man."" Mrs. Hudson tsks.

John chokes on his scone but wisely says nothing about the video he and Sherlock had stumbled across.

Eventually, they're left alone and John immediately crosses the room and wraps his arms around Sherlock. He buries his head in the folds on Sherlock's suit and mutters an apology.

""My first reaction is anger when people see me as an Omega. I'm sorry... But I need you to know it has nothing to do with your status as my mate. I just hid it, for so many years. It'll take some getting used to, being out in the open like this.""

""You don't have to apologize, John. It's a very raw visceral feeling when people see you as less than or incompetent because of who they assume you are. I see you as John first and my mate second. Omega isn't even in the top ten list of things I associate with you."" Sherlock holds John close and scents him, letting John know he's forgiven even though there's nothing to forgive.

""Being seen as an omega can put you in a dangerous position. You've learned to defend and protect yourself. If you want to keep being perceived as a beta I have no problem with that. We can get something to cover your bond mark."" He kisses John's head but the mention of covering John's mark makes his insides squirm.

""I just want you to be safe and happy. However, you decide to do that I'll support you."" He rubs his hands over John's back.

""Cover it up? God.. no. I don't want to cover it up."" John says quickly, pulling away to glare at Sherlock as if he'd just suggested John run barefoot over a path made out of loose lego bricks.

""Why would I cover it up? I'm safe, now. I'm bound to you. Only you can smell my Omega side now.""

John has his head on Sherlock's chest when a faint tapping sound reaches his ears. He looks up and finds Sherlock staring at the door with a snarl on his face. John closes his eyes and heaves a sigh.

""Only been home ten minutes. Of course, Mycroft would pop over to say hello""

""Stay here and I'll go dispatch him. I don't need him dampening our new bond."" Sherlock nuzzles John before heading down the stairs.

He whips the door open and glares. ""Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me."" He hissed.

""What? What's that smell?"" John wrinkles his nose then Sherlock in hissing. Only, his hiss is made out of predatory instincts, rather than annoyance.

""You've got to be fucking kidding me."" He echoes, ""Doesn't that arsehole know its proper to give a newly bonded couple a month of privacy? Who's behind this, your brother, or the military?"" he wonders out loud

""I don't care. I want them gone."" Sherlock growls. ""Probably Mycroft. The military knows it would get a shit storm for infringing on a newly bonded pair. My brother pisses where he likes."" Sherlock goes down and opens the door.

""Go the fuck away."" He snarls at his brother and the lackey who's accompanied him.

The stench of two annoyed male Alphas assaults John's senses. Mycroft's sour citrusy scent nearly overpowers Sherlock's, making John want to whimper.

Instead, he grits his teeth and puts the kettle on. He purposely only fills it with enough water for two. He knows why Mycroft is here, and it isn't for a social call, or to wish the bonded couple well.

He's here to record proof of the bond. A picture of John's neck that will forever remain in his file. Proof for the government, so they know just how many Omega's they Don't have to worry about running about the city without a legal alpha.

If Sherlock is unsuccessful in getting rid of Mycroft, at the very least, John will show Mycroft just how unwanted his visit is by not making him a cup of tea.

""If both of you don't leave right I'll fight the two of you right here,"" Sherlock growls.

Three sets of feet make their way up the stairs. John lets out a resigned sigh and undoes the top three buttons of his shirt. Every Omega knows this scenario.

First: An alpha bites you, leaves his mark on you that you'll carry with you until one of two things happen. 1) you die, of old age or other means. 2) And this usually only happened to those who bonded to a friend or schoolyard crush in hopes that they wouldn't be sold off to another Alpha... they could (would be forced to) undergo a painful medical procedure that would chemically remove the proteins and enzymes given to the Omega during the bonding process, resetting the Omega back to their original state. If they survived the process.

Second: The newly bonded couple would, at the very least, be given one week to be alone, to strengthen their bond.

Thirdly: Between one week and one month, the bonded couple would go down to the registration office and their bond would be recorded. The Alpha would sign a paper stating that the bond was consensual. (Which 8 out of 10 times was a load of bollocks) and the Omega would be subjected to having his or her bite inspected. In the modern age, pictures would be taken of the bite, and a mold of the Alpha's teeth would also be gathered. The officiate would then file everything away, where most often none of the information would ever see the light of day again.

When Sherlock enters the room again, his eyes lit with righteous fury, John just gives him a sad smile and flicks his color away from his neck. ""Let's get this over with.""

Sherlock grumbles and sticks the tray of goo in his mouth to get his bite imprint, the whole time staring daggers at his brother and the official. The officiate takes the picture of John's neck and has them both fill out some paperwork. Sherlock pulls the imprint of his bite out and hands it over as well.

""I think that's all."" The officiant says.

""It certainly is not."" Sherlock unbuttons his shirt and shows the bite mark on his neck. ""This goes in the file as well."" He smirks when he sees Mycroft pale.

John has almost finished buttoning his shirt back up when Sherlock's words make his fingers freeze. Someone is stuttering, and John thinks it's Mycroft, but he can't tear his eyes off of Sherlock long enough to glance over at the other two men.

""Sherlock?"" John asks, eyes wide and his voice breathless, ""What are you doing?""

""If your bond mark is going on the file then so is mine. I bit you and you bit me back. I don't see why your mark gets to go in the file but mine doesn't."" Sherlock pulls his shirt over. ""Take the bloody picture already."" He snaps at the officiate.

Mycroft speaks first. With a flick of his hand, he motions the officiate forward.

""Best just do it. Neither my brother nor Doctor Watson will appreciate our interference at a future date.""

""Damn right we won't,"" John growls. As the man nears Sherlock and touches the bite (as if making sure it was real) John's lips pull back and he lets out a feral snarl. ""Take the damn picture and get out."" He hisses while moving forward. Mycroft stops him with a palm against his chest before he can get to Sherlock's side.

At first, the act angers John, he steps back and gives Mycroft a brisk nod. The thought of anyone touching Sherlock there makes him murderous, and he can't be quite sure what he'd do to the officiate if he'd been allowed to get any closer.

Once the pictures are taken, the officiate all but scurries out of the room. They hear him practically running down the stairs. Only then does Mycroft lower his hand. John rushes forward and pushes Sherlock up against the wall, rubbing his head across Sherlock's neck, then licking away any remnants of the other man's scent.

""Mine."" he purrs, once Sherlock smells like them again.

Sherlock holds John close and scents him and nuzzles. ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" He apologizes and then pulls back.

In one swift move, he slams Mycroft back against the wall, his hand tight around his throat. ""If you ever and I mean ever touch my mate again I'll rip that cold black shriveled organs from your chest where your heart should be. If you ever pull some bullshit like this again I'll tell Mummy about your arrangement with Anthea."" He snarls, his hand so tight around his brother's neck it's sure to bruise.

""By law, we're allowed one week, Mycroft,"" John seethes, coming up to stand directly behind Sherlock.

He looks at how Sherlock's holding Mycroft and gives his mate a satisfied nod. He's holding most of the pressure up just under his chin, no risk of crushing his windpipe. And probably no long-term damage to vocal cords. For once, the doctor in him doesn't care that he's witnessing another man in distress.

""Did you think I'd come out of this heat pregnant? Trying to... rush things along, are you? What was your goal, pulling this stunt?""

""Court- Marshal."" Mycroft manages to get out.

Sherlock frowns and drops his hand. ""What?""

""Court Martial over what? I'm not even bloody enlisted!"" John barks, and this time it's Sherlock who holds him back.

""What are they mad about? Me ordering that desk jockey around? That's his bloody job, to help Omegas like me. He messed up, miscalculated when I needed to swap brands.""

""A piece of legislation that was approved under the radar. After an omega who was registered with the military registers with an alpha, they have sixty days to have their bond filed or else the military assumes hold back over the omega and bonds that omega to an alpha without their consent. We're on day fifty-nine."" Mycroft rubs his throat.

Sherlock growls, angry at Mycroft and alphas in general.

""Fuck them..."" John growls and turns to the kettle. The water in it has long since gone cold. He adds a bit more water to it, then flicks it on again. This time with the intention of offering Mycroft a cup.

""Why didn't they tell me? I'm allowed that information. Fuck..."" He swears again and drags his hands through his hair. Anxiety at how close he'd been to having it all, just to lose it, makes him start to shake.

""When your legal responsibility is changed from the military to a civilian alpha they don't have to inform you of anything anymore since you are no longer their responsibility until they assume control of you again and at that point, they decide who to bond you with. After your service is concluded the only thing you're useful to for them is providing pups. Which if the alpha you're bonded to at the time is still active duty the pups become ward of the military that you get the privilege of raising for them."" Mycroft frowns.

John reaches up for a third mug and slams it down on the counter.

""My life, my body... not theirs."" He spins around and glares at Mycroft. ""You change the rules of the universe on a daily basis, it's like, squashing ants for you. Why hasn't this changed? Why are we property just because our insides are different?""

Mycroft offers him a sad smile but doesn't say anything. John just nods and turns back to fix the tea.

""Yeah, I know... money. People like being rich, and If I can produce them cute little Omega pups for them to sell off, why would they give me up."" The brothers both take milk and sugar in their tea. John fixes the three mugs then moves them to the table, motioning for the two alphas to sit. ""Calm down you two, I'd be able to smell you from speedies. Mycroft, have you ever seen... that, before?"" John motions to Sherlock's neck and shrugs.

""It was... instinctual, my body told me to do it, so I did it. We were too busy wrapping up statements with the French Police to look into it. We don't know if it will last, or if he'll have a mark. But both of our awareness changed. I see things like he does, sharper, with more clarity. My mind is a chaotic midfield of data. He... he smells things like I do, like an Omega now.""

Sherlock opens the kitchen window before sitting next to John to air the flat out.

""It,"" Mycroft thinks of how to word it. ""It's a sign of a perfect match.""

Leave a comment and let us know what you think!

Big brother leaves a parting message...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""It.."" Mycroft thinks of how to word it. ""It's a sign of a perfect match.""

""That's a real thing?"" Sherlock gapes, having heard the stories like all pups had about finding your perfect biological match.

""That's the only thing I can think of. I'll have to look into it more."" Mycroft sighs.

""Perfect match?"" John says, testing the words out on his lips. ""Meaning... he and I were supposed to bond? We were meant for each other?""

As soon as he says it, he knows it's right. Of course, it is.

""Alpha and Omega... beginning and the end,"" John says softly, reaching under the table to place a hand on Sherlock's knee. ""Revelation 22 can't remember the verse. But something about... give to each one according to what he has done.""

The brothers gape at him and John rolls his eyes.

""Didn't you two go to Sunday school? Out of context, because of course, that was talking about the end times. But... give unto each one what he has done. A bite for a bite. Fuck, it makes sense.""

John curls his free hand around his mug and stares at a spot in the center of the table. ""Can't imagine it's common, nowadays... Are there any others like us?""

Sherlock and Mycroft just stare at John, a little confused and surprised.

""It's rare. Very rare. Because the way omega's are sold off to the highest bidder it's very unlikely to be their true match. Those kinds of things have to develop naturally. Or so the story goes."" Mycroft shrugs.

Sherlock rubs a hand over his face, confused about all of this.

""If people only knew..."" John says a bit sadly, squeezing Sherlock's knee before scrubbing at his own face. ""This... is a whole new level of living. It's more than just an awareness of his moods and well-being. It's... like my brain is half him, half me.""

He sips his tea in silence after that, mind racing as he imagined a world where everyone knew about this possibility, and Omegas were no longer simply sold off.

Sherlock rests his hand on John's and holds it. He feels John's anger but also his profound sadness.

""I can't imagine the strength it takes to deal with him in your head."" Mycroft quips and sips his tea.

""I like it,"" John shrugs. ""It helped me stop him from punching the police this morning. Sherlock, we can't just keep what we have a secret. Is there anything we can do?""

""He does have a knack for getting into fights."" Mycroft muses.

""I don't know if we'd be believed. If anything it would make us a target if people who want to keep it hidden."" Sherlock sighs.

""Well, I'm not hiding it..."" John says, though deep down he's afraid that Sherlock is correct. ""I just won't make a blog post about it.""

""Mycroft, are you able to find out if there are any records, past or present, of Alpha's who have had bites on their necks recorded? They're public records... so it shouldn't be illegal."" Sherlock asks suddenly.

""I can look into it."" Mycroft nods.

""This could be grounds for law changes. It infringes on alphas bodily autonomy which is illegal. If an alpha's perfect mate is out there and it's sold off to someone else that could mean the alpha could sue for rights if the omega."" Sherlock frowns.

""But then we run into a major issue... How do you find your perfect mate? Matchmaking websites? Are there tests? Do we go back to the old ways, where an Alpha would court an Omega, and it was the Omega protected by the law?""

John mirrors Sherlock's frown and drums his fingers on the tabletop.

""Two hundred years ago, it was the Omega who called the shots. The courting rituals in their favour. Alphas could line up at their doorsteps and beg to court them, but the Omega could brush them off and walk away unscathed. We're all read those stories by our Omega parents. It ends with one Alpha getting mad that an Omega chose someone else over him, he caused a coup and brought the whole system down. I used to think they were just stories... but what if there's more truth to it?""

""We need to do research."" Sherlock nods.

Mycroft nods and stands. ""I'll do what I can and get the both of you as much evidence as I can.""

""Where do we even begin,"" John snorts, ""The library?""

He looks up at Mycroft as he reaches for his umbrella and offers the man a nod of thanks before watching him go. Turning back to his alpha he tilts his head and grins.

""We could go to the museum. Maybe if we look at old art, we'll see something? Plus, it would be nice to get out and stretch my legs after spending the last few days in bed.""

Sherlock nods. ""That's a good start. I also think we should talk to older omega's. It would be them who remember the stories passed down to them about having power over their lives.""

""Yeah, that sounds like a logical step."" John drags his hand through his hair and sighs. ""This... sounds dangerous.""

""I think for now we spend time together and recover. Strengthen our bond. And then we can take down the ruling bodies."" Sherlock hums.

""Well then, come strengthen it in the shower. Mm, no wait, the bath. We still have a bath bomb left."" John stands and heads down the hall, smiling when he hears Sherlock's chair scrape across the floor.

""Bring some wine, and the scones,"" he calls out as he steps into the bathroom. He looks at the tub and feels a wash of happiness. Since that first bath, when Sherlock had sat with his back turned towards him, the bath had remained free of experiments. As if, Sherlock had seen how much John enjoyed soaking in the tub and wanted to make sure John could do it whenever he wanted.

Sherlock brings wine and scones as John requests. ""Would you like to be behind me or me behind you?"" He asks as he strips.

""You've got the longer legs. Last time I was in back you looked like a grown-up in one of those battery-powered kiddie cars. You in back until we get a bigger tub.""

It's a bit of a struggle, but they manage to get into the tub together. John rests his back against Sherlock's chest and reaches for the wine. Sherlock has already uncorked it, so he pours out two glasses then passes one back to his mate.

""It's a bit weird, having you in my head all the time. But I think I'm going to like it. If we get separated on a case, I'll know you're safe.""

Sherlock nods. ""It makes me feel better. I feel more relaxed and not as worried about other alphas.""

John snorts then says, ""Means I don't have to worry about you doing something stupid. Like going off alone and getting yourself smacked over the head with a board.""

Sherlock prods John in the ribs, making him laugh and relent. ""That was my idea, wasn't it.""

""I suppose I ought to be more careful these days. I do have an omega after all."" Sherlock nuzzles behind John's ear.

Short chapter is short. We don't plan out chapter lengths. Just split them where it feels right. Tune in for more tomorrow!

John runs into Harry at the park...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

After a week of endless bubble baths, cuddling, and sex on every surface (Including against Mrs. Hudson's flat door when she was out one morning) John is both pleased and disappointed when a case finds its way to their doorstep.

The case itself is trivial, barely a five by Sherlock's own standards. But they're both going stir crazy, even if neither of them will admit it. John urges Sherlock out the door when Sherlock's microscope proves to be insufficient.

""Go to Bart's, use theirs. Molly won't mind."" John says, practically shoving Sherlock's arms in his coat as if dressing a child. ""I'm going to wash our bedding again then go for a walk and smell air that doesn't stink like nonstop sex.""

He kisses Sherlock on the lips, then pulls back his scarf long enough to swipe his tongue over Sherlock's bite. ""Go,"" he says softly, ""I'll be here when you get back. Tell Molly I said hello.""

Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second, then Sherlock is wrapping his arms around John so tight that for a solid ten seconds John isn't able to draw breath. ""Go,"" he croaks, pushing at his Alpha's chest.

Sherlock's laughter, rich and velvety, follow him down the stairs as he leaves. John watches the empty staircase for a moment, then busies himself with the washing up. When their room is once again presentable, he puts his own coat on and heads out to Regent's Park for a stroll.

He's barely gone one circuit around the perimeter of a park when a familiar scent makes him look to his left. There, with her nose in a book, is his older sister Harry. She's absentmindedly tossing bread at the ducks and doesn't even look up when he sits down on the blanket beside her.

""Not interested, whatever you're selling. I don't carry cash on me."" She says, turning a page.

""Then give me some bread,"" John says, reaching into an old shopping bag and pulling out a mangled piece of bread. Ripping it up he tosses it into the water. For the next minute, he ignores her gaze until she looks up at him.

Harry's head whips around to look at John. ""Jesus Christ!"" She yelps. ""What the fuck are you doing here? You haven't bloody called me since you got back. Thought you were dead in a ditch somewhere you little arsehole."" She punches his arm.

""You could have called. Phones work both ways."" John shrugs, pinching another piece of bread and feeding the small flock of ducks quacking up at him. He feels them begin to slip into the all too familiar blame game and sighs. Tossing the blast bit of bread to the ducks he shifts on the blanket and faces his sister. ""I could have called as well. But, I didn't."" Their only form of communication, if it can even be called that, has been when Harry commented on his blog and he replied. Best just to get it over with then,  ""I, well, I have some news. But you're not going to like it.""

Harry had been the Alpha who had been required to sign over his ownership when he'd joined the army. With their dad gone Harry had defaulted to making his legal choices. She hadn't been pleased with his choice, but their mum had convinced her to let John join. Still, John knew she felt a sense of ownership about him and had been angry when he hadn't asked her to take it back when he'd returned home.

""I... well, I bonded."" He tilts his neck to let his older sister see the mark. Still fresh, it was red, with a bit of bruising around the teeth marks, but it would be clear to anyone who looked at it that John had not struggled while receiving it. It was clean, with no torn flesh, just perfect incisions.

""WHAT. THE. FUCK!"" Harry growls, pulling John close to inspect his neck. ""And you didn't tell me! Jesus, John! I'm supposed to look out for you! And you just shack up with some random alpha! Knew I should have kept a closer eye on you. Can't leave you alone for five minutes. Wanting to join the bloody army and now this. Do you not have any self-preservation skills at all?"" She snaps, touching the bond. ""It's new. Really new. Where the hell is this alpha then? Letting you walk around alone freshly bonded? I'll bash their fucking head in."" She growls.

""Touch my mate, and I will bite your fucking fingers off,"" John snarls at his sister. The blinks, realizing just how true that statement was. Not because it was Harry, being a bitch and insisting she knew how to live his life better than he did. But because he would hurt anyone who hurt Sherlock. No questions asked, he would.

""I'm a grown fucking man, I can go where I want when I want."" Angry John pulls out of her touch and stands. ""But you're one of them, aren't you? Who prefers their Omega's trapped indoors perpetually pregnant until their body is so exhausted it kills them when they get pregnant one too many times? Is that what you want for me, Harry? Is your life only worth how many pups I produce?""

""That's not what I said, John."" Harry snaps. ""You bonded someone without even telling me! I'm your sister for Christ's sake! Didn't even invite me to the bonding ceremony. Trying to cut me out of your life totally? You've been trying to get away from our family since you were old enough to walk. And now you've and gone got yourself bonded to someone. What changed? You always hated the idea of being trapped with someone for the rest of your life. Did you go into heat and get in trouble? Begged anything with a knot to make it better?"" She snarls.

John's already on his feet and walking towards his flat. Taller than him by several inches, Harry catches up easily, even stopping long enough to shove her book and blanket into her handbag. Setting his jaw he hurries on, knowing that no one in their right mind would stop an Alpha from chasing after an Omega. And his bond bite, high above his collar, now told the world exactly what he was. Harry's heels click on the stone path as she shouts after him, demanding him to stop. He doesn't stop, he resists the itch between his shoulders, the urge to listen to the Alpha, his blood. Getting to the main road he flags down a cab and climbs in. Before he has a chance to shut the door, Harry sticks her hand in the door and snarls at John to push over. He has half a mind to slide to the other side and exit the car. But one look from the Alpha driver, and a deafening click, tells him the auto safety locks have been engaged. There is no escape for John.

""221 Baker Street,"" he hisses as he slides over and makes room for his sister. ""Mum would be disappointed in you,"" he says softly then instantly regrets throwing his mother's name at Harry like an insult.

Their mother had been kind. The type of woman who could make the best out of any situation. Who could make even the saddest people smile. In love with life and her family, she had taught John to fight against society's standards for Omegas. Telling him that there was so much more to life than simply existing in it. She'd passed only a year after their father, brokenhearted at his loss and unable to bear a world where he didn't exist.

""You don't have to tell me that. I feel it with every fiber of my being."" Harry mumbles, looking out the window. ""She was my mum, too. Just because you were an omega doesn't mean that she was any less of a mum to me. Even though she liked you better.""

""She didn't like me better."" John snaps, sick of this argument. ""She needed to teach me how to not be a pushover and, as you said, how not to beg anything with a knot to make it better""

The driver gets them to their destination in record time, clearly not wanting their combined anguish to stink up his car any longer than necessary. ""My Alpha sister offered to pay,"" John grumped, rolling the window down and opening his door from the outside.

He runs into Mrs. Hudson, who's just on her way out. She frowns at Harry, as she stomps up behind John.

""John?"" She asks questioningly, making John's heart melt. He knows, in that instant, that Mrs. Hudson would put her foot down and not let Harry step one foot into her property if John expressed that was his desire.

""My sister, Mrs. Hudson. Meet Harry. And, as you have no intention of leaving me alone, sis, why don't you come up. I can sense my Alpha getting closer. He'll love to have a chat with you.""

""Would you like me to stay, dear? I can put some tea on and we can all wait for Sherlock together."" Mrs. Hudson says softly, subtly standing between Harry and John. She was just as protective over John as she was Sherlock.

""No, Sherlock should be here shortly,"" John says, leaning in and kissing her on her cheek. ""Go enjoy bridge, and brag all about your bonded couple. Sherlock will be here soon, and Harry is more bark than she is bite. After all, she can't seem to find an Omega to bond.""

John casts his sister a withering glare, then pushes the door open. In mock politeness, he says, ""After you, Alpha. Up the stairs...""

""Well, you know where my special tea for guests is."" Mrs. Hudson pats his arm and heads out. Her special tea was actually an empty tin with a small revolver inside but no one outside of their house needed to know that.

Harry rolls her eyes and goes up the stairs. ""It stinks like alpha and sex in here."" She mocks a gag and opens a window. ""This place is a mess as well. Is that a skull?"" She gawks at the skull on the mantle.

""That's Billy,"" John says, moving to the kitchen to open the window by the sink. She wasn't wrong. The flat did need a good airing out. He'd have to talk to Sherlock about an air purification system.

""My mate is a scientist, so don't touch anything weird. Chairs are safe, as is the mantle. But... can't promise that the sofa isn't covered in come.""

John's mobile buzzes in his pocket, and he smiles a bit, knowing without looking that it would be from Sherlock. He ignored it, wanting to see Harry squawk at the full wrath of Sherlock Holmes walking in to find a strange Alpha in his house.

""Sit, I'll make tea,"" John calls over to his sister and counts down the minutes until Sherlock's footsteps come barreling up the stairs.

Sherlock frowns when John doesn't answer his text since John is usually prompt with that. He pays the cabbie and gets out, noticing the window upstairs was open. He opens the door downstairs. ""John?"" He calls up as he closes the door. He notices a smell and tries to place it. It was John's and someone else. Alpha

Sherlock growls and all but flies up the stairs and throws the door open, it slams so hard against the wall it bounces back and Sherlock grips it tight.

""Who are you?"" He growls deep and dangerous, a strange alpha in his territory, and by the sounds and smells coming from the kitchen, alone with his mate. ""Who?"" He snaps again, hating to repeat himself.

John stands back, between the kitchen and the living room, with his arms crossed over his chest and a grin plastered across his face. The look on his sister's face is priceless. She's paled so severely that she looks like Casper the ghost. Her fingers dig into the arms of Sherlock's chair (in which she unwisely sat, but John wasn't about to correct her) as she cowers under the Alpha.

She knew instantly that it was his home, and that any attempts to fight him meant he could do whatever he wanted to her. Her eyes find John's, and she stares desperately at her brother.

Rolling his eyes, John uncrosses his arms from his chest and walks to Sherlock. Placing a hand on his shoulder he says softly, ""Meet my sister. She sort of followed me here.""

Sherlock relaxes a bit as John touches him. He holds John close and scents him, not taking his eyes off Harry. ""You mean she stalked you like a creep.""

""Mmhmm."" John hums, happily letting Sherlock rub his face over his entire torso and neck. ""Said some pretty rude things to me as well. What did you say, Sis? Something about... Not being able to take care of myself, wanting any knot... and... Oh yes insinuated that I only bonded with you to make it better.""

John looks over at his sister and says in a deathly quiet voice, ""You're in my Mate's chair. I suggest you move. Oh, yeah, Harry, this is Sherlock Holmes, my soul mate.""

Harry scrambles out of the chair. ""Soulmate? You know those are just stories, John. Make it easier for omega's to swallow their place.""

Sherlock makes a sound of disbelief. ""Is she always like this?"" He asks John.

""Only when she's had an Omega turn her town."" John sighs, his face still buried against Sherlock's chest.

""She was my Alpha after dad died. I think she only let me join the military because mum asked her.""

Sherlock nuzzles John's hair. ""I'll drag her out if you want.""

""No, we should all talk."" John sighs and pulls away as Harry scrambles out of Sherlock's chair and stands a ways away, doing her best to look small and nonthreatening in another Alpha's domain.

""Sit, have my chair,"" John suggests, motioning Harry to the red armchair. A growl starts in Sherlock's throat but John hushes him with a kiss.

""I'll sit on your lap if it makes you feel better. But I'm perfectly fine dragging one of the wooden chairs over.

""I had been making tea,"" John says and leaves the two Alphas to size each other up. ""I'll go finish, no taking your cocks out and comparing them, please. I do not need to see my sister's cock.""

Sherlock glares at Harry but sits across from her, looking as big and dangerous as he can.

John comes back with the tea a few minutes later and shoves a mug into Harry's hands, sloshing some of the hot liquid over the brim and onto her lap.

""Oops."" He says flatly, then hands (more carefully) Sherlock his mug. He retreats into the kitchen for his mug, then pulls a spare chair up to Sherlock's chair and sits.

""Harry here was just saying how rude it was we didn't invite her to the bonding ceremony. I agree, rude of us not to even invite ourselves.""

Rolling his eyes John glares daggers at his sister then says, ""We didn't have one, Harry. We bonded, came home, and some bloke from the registry showed up, took the pictures, and left. We haven't even discussed a party or anything like that.""

Harry wipes her hand off on her trousers. ""So you're just doing everything backward. I'm surprised you're not knocked up.""

Sherlock snarls, John's hand the only thing keeping him in his seat.

""Backwards?"" John growls, his fingers digging into Sherlock's arm. ""How is bonding backward? We talked about it, for months, Harry. We had a plan, and knew we both wanted it when my heat came.""

John sets his mug down on the table and flexes his hand. ""Or are you just mad that we didn't ask your permission first? We didn't have to. I was still a ward of the military, they expected me to bond.""

""You were my responsibility! Mum made me promise!"" Harry snaps.

""No, Mum asked you to keep me safe. Not dictate my every fucking move in life."" John growls back. ""I don't need you, and I sure as hell don't need Sherlock. But that's the point,"" John says, tightening his grip on Sherlock's arm when he feels his mate tense. ""I want him, Harry. I'm not bonded with him because I require him. I bonded with him because I want him.""

John slumps back in his chair and heaves a sigh. Scrubbing his hand through his hair he blows a breath out between his lips.

""Before him, life was grey. I was injured, you were busy telling me how I'd be perfectly healthy if I had done things your way. Harry, for Christ's sake I wanted to eat a bullet.""

His sister stops fretting with her wet trousers and looks up sharply.

""It was bad, for a while there. Then this bloke needed a flatmate, and he showed me how to live again. Life had colour again. He didn't care who or what I was, he just wanted me for me.""

John sighs and explains how they'd met, and how they'd pretended to be in a relationship. His first heat when the military had messed up his suppressants. For the first time in his life, he's fully open with his sister. He ignores how weird it is to explain the sexual requirements of his body to his own blood, but does so anyway so his sister can understand. When he's done, he looks over at Sherlock and reaches out. Pulling down Sherlock's collar he shows his sister the matching mark his Alpha now wore.

""Dad had one too? Didn't he? Just... lower on his neck?""

Harry frowns and nods, looking schooled. ""He did. Showed it off and made mum blush..""

""Really?"" Sherlock looks at John.

""Yeah,"" John says around a sigh. ""I kept thinking about it after your brother left. Wondering why mum used to read those stories to me.""

Reaching for his tea he takes a sip then shrugs over at his sister.

""It's not a myth. Some of us are just lucky enough to avoid the system of forced bondings, and get to choose our mates.""

Harry rolls her eyes. ""Maybe some of us don't want a mate."" She grumbles.

Liar flashes over Sherlock's mind.

Sherlock's voice echoes throughout John's head. Liar it says. He cocks his head at Harry, inspecting her closely then nods once.

""Then don't get one, dummy."" John sighs, ""It's always a fight with you, isn't it. You couldn't just follow me here and meet Sherlock. Instead, you have to stir things up, then lie to us.""

John gets up and opens the second window before sitting on Sherlock's lap. It's a tight squeeze, two full-grown men, but they make it work with only a minimal amount of spilled tea.

""I'm done fighting with you, and when his family throws us a surprise bonding party, I'll make sure you're invited.""

Sherlock cuddles John close, one arm around his back and the other around his legs. He nuzzles John and kisses his neck.

Harry rolls her eyes and looks anywhere else.

Ignoring his sister, John turns to his mate and kisses his forehead.

""What made you leave Bart's so quickly? Did you solve the case? Was it the uncle?""

Sherlock hums. ""It was. I have to go back and finish the analysis. But I just.. I had a feeling that I needed to come home."" He shrugs.

""You can go,"" John says, kissing Sherlock a second time. ""Mrs. Hudson offered me the special tea, plus I'm not completely defenseless. Worst case, I can just punch my sister in the nose.""

""I'm not leaving you alone with her."" Sherlock shakes his head. His alpha couldn't leave his mate alone with another alpha in his territory even if it was his omega's sister.

""I'm right here you boobs,"" Harry says, reaching out her foot in an attempt to kick John's shins.

Sherlock stops the movement with his own foot and a look of pure ice.

""Harry, for fucks sake, why are you still fighting me? Us? We're happy, you don't have to worry about your baby brother anymore. You can focus on yourself, on what you want... maybe someday you'll be an aunt. Who knows, we're kind of leaving that question up in the air right now.""

Sighing, for what felt like the hundredth time that afternoon, John stares at his sister. ""Mum would have liked him, and she'd be happy to see me happy. This is what I want, no one forced anything on me. My only complaint is his brother. If you want to be a dick to someone, be a dick to Mycroft.""

Harry makes a face. ""I'm sorry."" She finally apologizes.

Surprise makes John go completely still. He stares at his sister for a long moment then nods once.

""Are you staying for dinner, Harry? Neither of us cooks much. But we do have the top twenty takeaways on speed dial.""

""If you want me to."" Harry nods but she looks to Sherlock for permission.

""If John invites you to dinner you don't need my permission."" Sherlock sighs. ""We're equaled and you are his sister. As long as he doesn't get any ideas of inviting my brother for dinner we're fine.""

""Sherlock, If I ever invite your brother to dinner, that's me signaling to you that I'm being held against my will.""

John laughs and stands up. Then holds his hand to his sister. ""Truce?"" he asks. She nods and shakes his hand.

""Mum would have been happy for you,"" She admits after a moment.

""Angelo's?"" John asks, after smiling at his sister. ""I could go for his lasagna.""

""Mm sounds good."" Sherlock nods and scents John once more before releasing him.

He follows John out and into a cab, making sure he's between John and Harry.

Dinner is quiet, but John's pleased that things aren't awkward or forced between himself and his sister. Sherlock, for his part, was happy to sit back and watch. Only once did he give Harry a warning glance.

Later, after they see Harry off, John closes the windows and turns to Sherlock. ""Heading back to Barts?"" he asks softly.

""I don't have to. Molly can send me the results."" Sherlock shrugs. He tosses a robe over John's chair to mask Harry's scent.

Oh, Harriot. I love your passion but calm your tits. Also, funny enough, both Accident and I picture Harriot to look like Alex Kingston.

John makes a choice...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Another week goes by, and soon John is faced with a hard choice. His mobile alerts him that he has three days to take a pregnancy test (to confirm he's not pregnant) and get on the new suppressants. When Sherlock finally drags himself out of bed, wrapped in nothing but a sheet, John greets him with a cup of coffee and sits him down at the table. He explains the choice he has to make and looks at Sherlock with a nervous smile.

""Do I go back on them? Or do I ask just for more contraceptives? Or... nothing at all?""

Sherlock sips his coffee, thinking. ""It's your choice. I just want to make that clear first thing."" He says softly. ""Are you ready for pups?"" He asks, setting his mug down.

""I..."" John scrubs a hand over his face and stares at the tabletop. ""Yes and no? Is anyone truly ready for a human to need them with such intensity?"" He chews his bottom lip then looks up at Sherlock. ""Are you?""

""I... I don't know."" Sherlock says softly. ""I want pups with you. I do. I just,"" He sighs. ""I don't think I'd be any good at it..""

""I'm scared too,"" John says after a long pause. He gets up and walks over to Sherlock. Standing beside his chair he leans down and presses his head against the top of Sherlock's head and sighs.

""We can try together? Bring life into this world for you to teach? I can do it, as long as I have you by my side.""

""Together."" Sherlock scoops John up and sets him in his lap, kissing him deeply.

John stops taking his contraceptive that very day. Normally, an Omega would be expected to make an appointment with their Gp to discuss the change in medication. They'd then be subjected to monthly (invasive) appointments to ensure all was working as intended. Luckily for John, he's a doctor and has an Alpha who doesn't care what John does, as long as he's healthy. They approach his next heat with nervous excitement. Mrs. Hudson visits her sister, and they spend three days in the throes of passion. Every day after his next heat, John asks Sherlock if he can smell a change. And every day he's met with a gentle, but sad shake of Sherlock's head. When enough time has passed that he can take a pregnancy test, he knows the answer, even before the test confirms it.

""Nothing,"" he says to Sherlock through the loo door, tossing the stick in the trash. ""Nothing..."" Sitting on the closed toilet lid as Sherlock comes in, he puts his head in his hands and fights back tears.

""I didn't realize how much I wanted this, Sherlock.""

""It's okay."" Sherlock holds John. ""It's okay. This is your first heat off suppressants and contraceptives. So it may take a little time to work out if your system. Besides, it's not unheard of for some couples to go through a few years until they get pregnant. We'll have pups. And until then we just keep doing what we're doing. In the meantime, we can practice new positions and things to help.""

He kisses John's head and rubs his back. ""It'll happen. Stressing about it will only make things harder.""

""I know..."" John says around a sniffle, burying his face into Sherlock's chest. ""You're right. Just another excuse to have sex, yeah?"" 

""I guess,"" John says later, after he's cried himself out, ""this means I want pups. Proof, that we're doing the right thing.""

Sherlock hands him a warm flannel which he gratefully accepts. He washes his face, then smiles. ""That's good, I guess. To find out now instead of finding out I am pregnant and having second thoughts.""

Sherlock smiles softly and nods. ""I think you're right."" He leans in and kisses him tenderly. ""I love you.""

""I love you, Sherlock,"" John says softly while leaning into the kiss. ""So much.""

Sherlock nuzzles him and scoops John up. ""I think we both need a cuddle. And you can drink.""

With the newly discovered void in his life, John begins to find ways to spend his time. One morning, after kissing Sherlock goodbye and telling him not to anger Anderson, John sits alone in the flat. Taking out his mobile he fiddles with the device before following through with his plan


'Any luck looking into bonds like Sherlock and I's? You could check my parent's records. I think they were perfectly matched.'


He hits send and sits back and waits. Unsure if asking Mycroft for help is the smartest choice. Mycroft didn't do things for free, and he wasn't sure what this would cost him in the long run


'Nothing. Just a few old folk tales but no academic work, no proven evidence, I can't even get into files that mention something about the alpha being bitten. The information isn't going to be readily available in the government since it's overrun with alphas who what it squashed and forgotten.-MH'


John fiddles with his phone for a few minutes then sighs. He knows where he can start but it means one of two things. Either he goes back home, roughly a five-hour drive, with Sherlock. Or without.

He has some family back in Lancashire, his mother's Omega sister and a beta brother of his dad's, along with cousins. He hasn't been home since his parent's deaths, having moved with Harry to London when she left for university.

He heads into the bedroom and packs a bag for both himself and Sherlock (just in case) then spends the day tracking down addresses, even going as far as to let Harry know his plans.

Leave a comment and let us know what you think! -Accident

I think this is why I love omegaverse so much. A half Holmes half Watson child would be unstopable. Certainly, even an adopted child raised by them would be as well, but there's something special about their biological child in my book. And this is coming from a woman who doesn't want/can't have kids LOL -Tindo

John takes Sherlock to the village where he grew up...

Enjoy!

Note from Tindo: I know nothing about the location in England I set at John's hometown. Please be kind to me in the upcoming chapters. If it helps, picture him in a fictional town.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Sherlock bounds up the stairs. ""John! John! Anderson slipped in a puddle of blood! I have pictures!"" He grins as he comes inside.

His grinning is soon replaced with a confused face and then a pained one. ""Are you leaving?"" His voice cracks, looking at the bags John had packed. ""What did I do? I can fix it. Whatever I did I can fix it, John. I promise. Just don't leave. You don't need to leave."" He says, feeling panicked and distressed.

Instantly John goes to Sherlock's side and soothes his hands up and down Sherlock's arms.

""Hush love, one of them is for you.""

He quickly explains the text from Mycroft and his fear that Mycroft won't be successful in helping them learn more about their bond.

""I was going to visit family in the morning and pick their brain about my parents. Thought you might like to come."" He finishes, motioning to one of the cases.

""Oh. Oh. Thank goodness."" Sherlock pulls John into his arms and scents John heavily.

""I couldn't ever leave you. Not willing at least."" John says softly. ""You're my other half. But I also wasn't going to force you into a cramped car for the better part of the day just to go sit and chat with my cranky relatives.""

""I know. I'm sorry. I just.. panicked."" Sherlock nuzzles him. ""Of course I want to go with you. They may tell me things about you from when you were younger. I won't miss that opportunity."" He grins.

""Git,"" John says fondly, looking over at the bags. ""It's only noon... we could be there by evening? No, I told them we'd be there tomorrow, already made reservations for a room.""

He stops, remembering what Sherlock had said about Anderson, and reaches for Sherlock's mobile.

""Show me?"" he giggles.

""Whenever you'd like."" Sherlock nods and brings up the pictures, laughing as he looks at them before handing his phone to John.

Anderson was lying face first in a pool of blood, a smear mark around the edge where he slipped. There's a few more pictures where he's trying to get up but ends up slipping onto his back. ""Those are priceless,"" John says, gasping for breath through his laughter.

The next morning the flat is a whirlwind of activity. With Sherlock forwarding case-solving information over to Lestrade, and John making sure they aren't forgetting anything. Sherlock pouts a bit, sad he won't be there to see the end of the case; a murderous wife who'd dismembered her husband for cheating., only slightly disappointed he won't be there to see the murderous wife arrested. They rent a car, rather than taking the train, and John slips behind the wheel with a grin. His new license is finally getting put to use.

""I should warn you,"" he says after they've been driving for a while. ""My aunt is one of those Omegas who's been cowed by her family into a shell of a life. Her Alpha is a decent man, treats her right if not a bit controlling... but Mum and her sister didn't have the best life as Omega kids...""

Sherlock frowns. ""Were they abused?"" He asks softly. He often wonders about John's parents, if they were like him and John. Soulmates. A perfect match. He wonders what it's like to be raised by parents who were a perfect match.

""Not sure,"" John gives a half shrug and shakes his head. ""Emotional abuse, perhaps? Mum didn't take us to see her parents often. She has an Alpha sister whom I've never met. I've just seen pictures of her and her family.""

""I've been wondering,"" he said softly, ""How mum and dad met, you know? I never thought much about dad's bite... it was, here,"" John points to the area when the shoulder meets the neck and shrugs again, ""Dad always wore a shirt, so we didn't see it often. Only if out swimming, whenever the weather decided to be warm enough for that. But, they loved each other, you know? It wasn't just a bond forced on my mum. She truly cared. When he got sick... Harry and I watched the life leave her eyes.""

""I'm sorry, John,"" Sherlock says softly, resting his hand on John's thigh. ""They only had you and Harry?""

""Mm."" John nods, ""We never found that odd as kids. It just was how it was. But I do remember my Aunt scolding mum for not having more. But she and dad were happy with us.""

""Large families never made sense to me. Anything over six feels overwhelming. And I hate how some people let their oldest kids raise the youngest while they keep breeding. It's horrible."" Sherlock sighs. ""My parents only had two as well but I think it was because I was such a hand full they didn't want to risk another like me."" He hums.

""Tell me about them? Your Mum and Dad? I want to know everything I can about you."" Sherlock prods.

""Mum's name was Joann, Dad's Harrison,"" John says, waiting for Sherlock to laugh at the originality of his and his sister's names.

Sherlock chuckles softly. ""Sherlock is a girl's name."" He smiles at John. ""I think that's nice. Named after your parents.""

""Sherlock is not a girl's name."" John laughs but then smiles at his mate.

""I got Mum's looks. Harry somehow came out an even split. She has dad's eyes and nose. Not sure where her attitude comes from. Neither of our parents were arseholes. Maybe it's just the Alpha in her?"" John sighs and slips into a shortened version of his life story. Telling Sherlock about the family trips, Christmas holidays spent bundled up by the fireplace, and everything he could remember about his parent's relationship. Ending with, ""they were more than the Alpha dad and Omega mother... They were home if that makes sense.""

Sherlock listens intently, taking in every bit of information John gives. He memorizes everything and files it away ""I think it does. I.. I'd like to be that four our pups."" He says softly.

Growing up for him wasn't exactly cold but it wasn't overly warm either. He wanted his pups to know they were loved and wanted. That their parents adored them.

""Me too, and I think they'll have that. I mean, we're choosing to have them. We want them. That must mean something, yeah?""

The ride is long, but the scenery beautiful. They stop a few times to let Sherlock stretch, and John let's Sherlock finish the last leg of the journey so he can watch once familiar landscape drift past them. Nearing the center of town he points to a small inn. ""I've made reservations there, if you want to stop so I can use the loo.""

""It does. We want them. We're choosing them. Our pups."" Sherlock nods and pulls into the inn. ""We can check in and put our bags away."" He finds a spot and parks the car, following John into the office.

""What can I do for you sir?"" A man behind the counter looks at Sherlock, ignoring John.

""My mate made a reservation."" Sherlock hums.

""What's the name?"" He turns to the computer.

""Watson,"" John says flatly, staring at the prick behind the counter. ""But you already knew that, didn't you Pete? Still mad I wouldn't let you fuck me behind the school?""

He feels Sherlock stiffen beside him. Silver Blue eyes fixate on Pete, and John sits back and waits for the explosion of information with a smug grin on his face.

""Pete, Alpha. You've tried unsuccessfully to gain the attention of three, no four Omegas. You've struck out each time, due to your erectile dysfunction, shameful, in an Alpha your age. You spend your time growing and cultivating marijuana plants on the family farm, selling the leaves illegally under the local coppers' nose. I think I'll have a chat with them after we've checked in. Would you be kind enough to introduce me, John?""

John covers his mouth with his hand and tries his best not to laugh. ""Yeah, of course.""

Sherlock snatched up the key when it's offered in a trembling hand. He gives one last glare before following John out. ""What an arsehole."" He grumbles as they go and get their bags.

He helps John carry their things inside after unlocking the door. ""I'm sorry you have to deal with people like him.""

""Oh yeah this town is full of charming people,"" John says, tossing his bag on the bed.

""Everyone here knows me as Harrison's Omega son. Aside from my aunt, not sure anyone knows or cares about the years I spent in the military. Hell, no one even knows I'm a bloody doctor.""

Sherlock frowns. ""I'll just shove it in their faces then.""

He starts to unpack when something occurs to him. ""The erectile dysfunction. I could see the signs like normal but I could.. smell it?"" He looks at John confused. ""Omega's can smell that?""

""Wait!"" John stops unpacking and turns to Sherlock with an incredulous look on his face. ""You can't? Normally?""

""Nope."" Sherlock pops the 'p' and shakes his head. ""I suppose it's a biological advantage for omega's. Picking a mate whose cock actually works.""

""Oh, that's not it at all. At least, not for me."" John says, sitting on the edge of the bed while watching his mate.

""Oftentimes Erectile Dysfunction comes from the person's subconscious. Men, who have grown up in overly religious families, being taught that masturbation or sex before bonding is wrong. Yet, being blokes with a working body, they give it a shot. Guilt creeps up on them, even if they don't realize it, making it hard to maintain a hardon.""

John scrunches his face up, remembering the acrid scent coming off Pete in waves. ""Us Omegas have learned to see it as A person with something to hide. and that usually is a good enough reason to make sure you're never alone with them.""

""Ohh."" Sherlock nods, finishing unpacking. ""You grew up religious? Or is this just a heavily religious town?"" He sits next to John.

""Small town, more... superstitious than religious. But, yeah, we went to church. Some of us more than others. My family just did the major holidays, or if mum and dad got into a spat and they felt guilty."" John clarifies while pressing his weight against Sherlock's shoulder.

Sherlock wraps his arm around John and holds him close, nuzzling his hair. ""Sometimes it surprises me how different we grew up.""

""Mmm, I was allowed free reign of pretty much this whole town, until I presented."" John sighs. Sherlock's scents help override the dull chemical scent used to deodorize the rooms between guests. The air purifier in the corner hums, which reminds him of something he'd been meaning to bring up.

""Sherlock, with my sister back in my life, and your brother never leaving yours, and clients. We should get an air purifier in the lounge. Something we can turn on when other people come over so it isn't overwhelming. Come winter, we won't be able to open the windows as often. Not without freezing ourselves out.""

Sherlock sighs and nods. ""You're right. Only for the common areas though. I want our room to smell like us."" He kisses John's head.

""Mm."" John agrees, then looks out the window and takes in the town he'd grown up in. ""Why don't we start with my mom's sister, Jennie? With any luck, they'll invite us to dinner and embarrass me by showing you pictures of me as a kid. I went through a stage where I refused to wear shirts for an entire summer. Mum gave up trying, and just made me wear dungarees.""

Sherlock grins. ""I want copies."" He chuckles and kisses John soundly.

John takes Sherlock to meet his Aunt...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

When they were ready to go Sherlock followed John out, ignoring the odd looks they got from passers-by because he wasn't driving. ""They know we're coming, right?"" He asks, the people they pass watching. He hated small towns for that reason. ""Everyone seems to know we're here..""

""Yup... after we found out I wasn't pregnant I called my aunt. She said to come up any time, and when I suggested we visit now, she didn't object.""

John glowers at the people watching and contemplates backing up into Pete's truck. ""Still driving that piece of crap his grandfather left him...."" John rolls his eyes and grunts, ""We're in England, he doesn't even live on a farm, what's he need a damned truck for?""

""Compensating."" Sherlock snorts and smirks.

""That reminds me..."" John groans and leans his forehead against the steering wheel before exiting the car park.

""We'll be asked about pups, and how many we want? When we'll be having them..."" He groans again and hits his head against the wheel a few times.

""We can tell them it's none of their business. Or we're waiting. Or that you have a few loads of my cum plugged up inside you as we speak."" Sherlock rubs John's back. ""Or we don't have to say anything.""

""Sherlock,"" John says, turning to look at his mate. ""There's something you need to know before we get there. The last time I was here... My mum had just died. Harry had taken over sole ownership of me, and she was moving us to London so she could attend uni. My aunt offered to let me stay with her and her Alpha, and said she'd help me get a good Alpha so I could settle down and spread my roots.""

Sucking in a deep breath he closes his eyes, remembering with striking clarity how vicious he'd been at the time. ""I told everyone off, swore to them that I'd never bond. That I'd rather drive into the ocean than bond. I... didn't know I'd meet you then.""

""John, you're allowed to change your mind. And if anything you probably wouldn't have bonded with anyone. I just happened to be your soulmate as well as being charming and handsome and brilliant. Really you couldn't have turned me down if you tried."" Sherlock smiles softly, gently teasing.

""Charming?"" John says, turning his head to fix Sherlock with a single arched eyebrow. ""I think we have a different definition of the word charming, love."" He smiles over at his mate then rolls his eyes at Sherlock's smirk.

""Right... Off to Aunt Jennie's we go.""

John rubbernecks as they drive through the town, pointing out old shops, or empty buildings where shops used to be. They pass a park and he slows down and glances out his window with a grin. ""I used to play there every day. We only lived a few streets away, mum would let me walk or take my bicycle.""

""Causing all kinds of mayhem I'm sure."" Sherlock chuckles, imagining John as a small boy running around with a pack of friends.

""Who? Me?"" John pretends to be appalled at the accusation, ""I was an angel.""

Unable to keep a straight face he bursts out laughing. ""This one time, I'd gotten ahold of a bottle of vinegar. One of those giant gallon bottles restaurants get. My friend Winston and I made the biggest paper mache volcano we could manage, and about three boxes of baking soda. We mixed in a god-awful amount of orange food colouring with the vinegar. It was raining out, so we set the thing off on my mum's white carpet. I couldn't sit down for a week.""

Sherlock chuckles. ""At least you didn't break every window in your house twice during the course of one summer.""

""I don't think I want to know,"" John replies as he continues to drive.

After a minute or two, they pass a street and John frowns. ""That... that was my street. Not sure I can see the house. Not right now. My Aunt lives right up here anyways...""

A few minutes later they pull up in front of a small home. Large hedges line the borders, proving privacy from the close-quarter neighbors. Kids play out on the lawn and look up when the car pulls into the drive. One of them runs in, clearly to tell an adult that ""Someone is here"" and by the time John has the car in park, a round woman steps out, three small children no older than five trails behind her.

""Good God, they can't be hers... I have cousins only a few years younger than me."" John whispers as he pushes the door open and steps out.

Sherlock follows John, observing the gaggle of children and the woman.

""Hi, Aunty,"" John calls out to the woman. It takes her a moment to recognize him as a grown man, but she recovers quickly and steps forward to pull him into her arms.

""Where's Harry?"" She says, looking at the car, then at the man standing beside it. ""You said you'd bring her?""

""No,"" John says carefully, ""I said I would bring my Alpha. Aunty, meet my mate Sherlock.""

Jennie's eyes dart to John's neck, then John can smell the happiness on the woman as she puts two and two together. She releases John and goes to Sherlock. John half expects her to pull him into a bearhug, but instead, she simply thrusts out a hand for Sherlock to shake.

""A pleasure to meet you, Ma'am."" Sherlock shakes her hand, firm but gentle, and bows his head, an obvious sign of respect which is rare for an alpha to give an omega.

""Oh you got bagged by a polite one,"" Jennie says with a chuckle.

John catches Sherlock's eyes and with a shake of his head warns Sherlock not to argue or correct her.

""He's great,"" he says simply, then looks around at the kids playing. ""These aren't all yours, are they?""

""Oh goodness no!"" She laughs, rubbing the head of a toddler as he runs past. ""I run a sort of daycare, for those poor Omegas who have to work.""

""It's nice that they have someplace to be looked after."" Sherlock hums, following John and his Aunt inside the fenced-in yard.

""That it is,"" she agrees as she bustles to the door, ""Why don't you come in, you too John.""

""Yeah, I was sort of planning on it,"" John says with a roll of his eyes. ""Ta..""

Sherlock has to dodge a few children running around, nearly stepping on a few under his long legs. He walks through the yard like it's a minefield and finally makes it inside after John.

The house smells like nappy cream and something fruity. It instantly sets John back twenty some odd years to when he used to visit with his mother just after his aunt had given birth to her third.

""Still the same,"" he smiles, looking at the pictures on the wall as they walk through the hall towards the kitchen in the back. ""Frank looks great,"" he commented as he passed a recent family portrait.

""Uncle Frank, John."" She scolds but John just sticks a hand out, his fingers and thumb straight, and flaps them about, mouthing ""Blah Blah Blah"" to Sherlock.

Sherlock chuckles softly, looking at the pictures and taking in the house. It was obvious by John's aunt's hips that she had quite a few children herself and she still surrounds herself with pups.

""You run this daycare all by yourself?"" Sherlock asks, noting that most of the children seemed well behaved and were entertaining themselves.

""I do."" She says proudly, motioning John and Sherlock to sit at the table. ""Children born from an Omega are usually quite docile. Don't know where your mum went wrong with you two,"" she says, casting a look over to John who suddenly felt like a child being scolded for pinching a pastry before dinner.

""She didn't go wrong, she let us have fun.""

Sherlock rests his hand in John's thigh to comfort him. ""I'm sure John was a model child compared to me.""

""All the windows? Twice?"" He asks, turning to Sherlock with a laugh. ""Good god, Sherlock. You were a right terror, weren't you? I mean, you still are, so I guess that shouldn't surprise me.""

""John Watson"" his aunt shot out in a stern tone, ""We do not talk to our Alpha's like that."" Turning to Sherlock she dips her head in apology, ""Sorry if I offended you. I don't know your last name, but I assume John took it when you bonded.""

""Actually we hyphenated. Holmes-Watson. I insisted."" Sherlock nods, letting the weight of his words settle.

""Watson-Holmes still sounds better,"" John mutters playfully, nudging Sherlock's foot under the table. ""Aunty, he doesn't make me live in his shadow, so stop scolding me like I'm a child. If he takes offense by anything anyone does, he'll be the first to say so. Trust me on that one.""

John toys with a baby spoon on the table then he turns to his aunt. ""We're sort of here for answers, actually. Remember how Dad had that bite on his neck? Well, when Sherlock and I bonded it just felt right to give him one. It's given us this weird... joint bond. We're in each other's heads. Hell, he smelled Pete's problem when we checked into the inn because of our bond. Is there anything you can tell me about my parents' bond?""

John watches carefully as his aunt turns her back to them and begins making tea. He looks at Sherlock out of the corner of his eyes and notices him watching her with slanted eyes.

""You know what it means but you're trying to think of a lie that's convincing. We're all adults here. Bonded adults. We don't need to be treated like children. We've shown you nothing but respect and we'd like the same in return. Tell us what you know. It's much easier than having to deduce it."" Sherlock says, starting to get annoyed with her behavior.

""My sister was so proud of herself when she announced she and Hank had bonded,"" she says, setting the kettle down on the stove with a bit too much force. ""Came home to back her bags, bright red bite on her neck. We hadn't heard from her in four days. Our parents had gone to the police and everything. Thought someone snatched her just before her heat.""

Jennie sighs and picks at a frayed corner of a tea towel before turning to face the two men sitting at her table.

""She knew her heat was coming and knew our parents were in the beginning stages of an agreement with an Alpha who wanted my sister. So she ran off with Him and they spent half a week in a tent by the ocean fucking. She got pregnant with Harry because of that little stunt, preventing the other Alpha from laying his claim on her because he didn't want to raise some other Alpha's whelp.""

John shifts uncomfortably as he listens to his aunt. Her words were strained, and her wording made him think there was no small amount of anger being held back.

""She told me about her bonding, as she packed. Eyes bright with the wonder of her new life. Told me how she'd bitten him, and how they now shared one soul.""

Twitching her nose she stops short and glares at her nephew. ""But that's all I'll say. We've been warned not to talk about it, and I suggest you don't go about town asking about your dad's bond bite. You'll find people won't be as friendly with you if you do.""

""So you pumped out half a dozen pups trying to feel the same happiness your sister had gotten seemingly so easy and failed?"" Sherlock asks, waves of irritation coming off him. ""Instead of being bitter and jealous, you should have been happy for her. For her happiness. That she found the one person who could complete her. This."" He opens his collar and shows his bite. ""This is world-changing. Breathtaking. And I pity you for never being able to experience it but that doesn't mean you get to be horrible to John for something that happened before he was born.""

The air crackles around John as he watches his aunt, a person who believed her kinship provided her household with some small sliver of authority over John's life and his mate. He could feel Sherlock's anger and was in no position himself to send calming signals across the bond. All he could do was hope and pray his uncle wouldn't show up while everyone's hackles were still raised.

After a few minutes of the staredown, John clears his throat and nods at the kettle. The whistle had been taken out of the device, no doubt removed by his aunt after an untimely cup of tea had awakened one of the many children now taking up space, albeit temporary, in her house.

""Mum was happy,"" John says softly, ""Dad was happy too, and he provided the best life for all of us.""

""Until he went and killed himself."" Jennie spits

""He got sick,"" John growls, ""a heart attack isn't killing oneself.""

""I think that's quite enough for today."" Sherlock stands, rising to his full height.

John agrees and shows it by storming out of the house. Though his dramatic exit is slightly dampened by having to step over toys and children. Making it to the car first he pulls open the passenger's door and collapses inside. When Sherlock sits in the driver's seat he hands the keys over and closes his eyes.

""She's a bitch."" John hisses, gripping his bad leg and willing the phantom stab of pain to go away. ""Why didn't I see it before? Not allowed to play with my own cousins, despite living within walking. distance?""

""It's not your fault she's bitter and jealous. She saw my bite the minute she shook my hand. It set her off from the start."" Sherlock starts the car and makes sure there were no children around before pulling out of the drive.

He rests his hand on John's thigh and rubs it gently. ""I'm sorry it didn't go well. I know you were hoping for information about your parents. I.."" He thinks. ""What happened to all the things in your parent's house? Are they still there?""

John chews his lip for a moment then gives Sherlock a noncommittal grunt.

""Harry took care of that... I was a bit too upended by the whole thing to care. I'll ask her.""

Pulling his mobile out he shoots his sister a text then points to a road. ""Go left, I want to go scream into the surf.""

At first I wanted to like John's aunt. But by the end of this chapter we realized nope, she's a bitch.

The boys go to John's parent's house...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Harry texts John back that she sold the non sentimental things and most of the furniture. Everything else was still locked up in the house since they didn't have anywhere to put it when she was in uni. 

Sherlock nods and follows John's directions. Soon he parks in a lot by the sand and follows John out over the dunes.

Kicking his shoes and socks off John leaves them at the edge of the beach and walks down to where the dry sand met wet. He sits and puts his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands.

""I don't love being back here. I hate the looks, I hate her. I hate that I can't just go knock on the door and see my parents.""

""I'm sorry, John."" Sherlock sits next to him in the sand.

""It's fine."" John says softly, watching the water. The beach wasn't pretty by most people's standards. It was more rock and dangerous channels than it was lapping waves. Heck, there was a sign warning people of quicksand not far down the road. But this had been John's home for half his life. 

""I used to come down here and snog."" John said, turning to Sherlock with a shy smile on his face, ""Sherlock Holmes would you like to have a snog in the sand?""

""John, do you even have to ask?"" Sherlock smiles softly and pulls John close.

""No, I don't. I could just rip your clothes off and have you now, but the tied comes in fast... So maybe save that for later?""

Smirking John gets up off the sand and sits across Sherlock's lap, his arse on Sherlock's thighs and feet in the rocky sand behind Sherlock's back. Wrapping his arms around Sherlock's neck he leans in and presses his lips against his mate's cheek, then chin, then their lips find each other.

Sherlock holds John close, running his hands over his omega's back. He kisses John deeply, teasingly sliding his tongue along John's as the waves wash up and down the sand. 

He nips at John's lips and rocks against him teasingly.

John begins to relax under Sherlock's gentle care. His mate washes away the anger, replacing it with untainted love.

After what felt like ages, his lips sore, and Sherlock's legs certainly asleep, he got up and offered Sherlock a hand up.

""Let's go see my house. If Harry didn't move the spare key, I can get us in.""

""I can always pick the lock."" Sherlock takes John's hand and leads him back to the car, making sure they get their shoes. 

He follows John's directions and drives them to the house.

They sit in the driveway for a long moment before John opens the door steps out barefoot. The house is abandoned, but not  falling apart. Someone had been looking after it, and something told him it wasn't his aunt. 

""Harry must be paying someone to keep an eye on it."" John mused, thinking that perhaps it wouldn't hurt for him to offer to chip in once in a while.

""This way,"" he says, walking through a gate to the back garden. 

His feet carry him over familiar ground without thought. He goes to the back corner of the garden, the furthest point of the house, and lifts up a garden gnome. There, sitting in a waterproof case, is a silver key. Grinning he scoops it up and wiggles his toes in the grass. After a moment of that, he heads to the back door and slips the key into the lock.

The door opens easily, and they enter into a small room. ""Mud room, we used to call it. Because well, I might have covered every inch of that wall in mud when I was five."" John said, pointing to the wall facing the garden. 

""Kitchen is through here. What do you think we should look for?""

Sherlock hums as he looks around. ""Look for albums and pictures first. If we're lucky maybe one of your parents kept a journal.""

""Right."" 

The kitchen still smelled like home to John. Hints of his mother's favourite tea and her perfume still lingered, though it was nearly so faint he couldn't pick it out. 

Running his hands along the old table, he looked around the room and smiled sadly at a picture hung on the wall. It was the four of them, as a family. Harry looked to be about nine, while John was only six. He remembered that day, being forced to wear a suit with one of those clips on ties. His mother smiled down at him, while his father smiled over at his wife. 

""He never looked at the camera."" John said, nodding to the picture. ""Only had eyes for mum.""

Sherlock wraps his arm around John's waist as he looks at the picture, holding John close. ""I wish I could have met them..""

""Me too,"" John says softly, then tugs Sherlock through a door into the living room. He tests a light and hums in surprise when the bulb sputters on, then notices that the furniture is free of dust. 

He looks down at his fingers then frowns.

""I ran my hand over the table. No dust,"" he says, holding his fingers up. ""There isn't a speck of dust anywhere. Why is this place so bloody clean? And the powers on?""

Sherlock frowns. ""Someone's been here. Recently."" He sniffs but can't smell anyone else in the house now. ""Harry wouldn't have hired a cleaning company, she can barely keep her own affairs in order let one this place. Maybe your aunt since she knew we were coming?""

""No,"" John shakes his head and frowns, ""you saw the way she talked about my parents. She wouldn't dare step into their home."" 

John focuses on the room, for a moment worried that he'd just broken into someone's home, thinking someone else now lived here. But the pictures on the wall were still of his family, and his mother's blanket was still draped over the sofa. He brings the blanket up to his nose and sniffs. 

""This has been laundered. Recently. Sherlock, there isn't that musty scent that comes with abandoned houses. As far as I'm aware, Harry hasn't been up here in at least two years. Possibly longer. There aren't any cobwebs, or signs of mice... What the fuck is going on?""

Sherlock frowns and strands in the center of the room, slowly turning and taking everything in. ""The house has been searched already."" He says finally. 

""Some of the pictures were just the slightest bit off center. That chair has been moved from the opposite corner of the room.."" He lists subtle changes. ""Fucking Mycroft."" He hisses. ""He must have sent someone to look through the house.""

""Ohh..."" John sighs, but relaxes. The thought of someone playing house in his family home had upset him more than he was willing to admit. As much as he didn't love Sherlock's brother, he was relieved to think that it had been him, or his underlings, who had cleaned up.

""Almost nice of him, leaving the power on. Like he knew we'd come.""

""Nosy prick."" Sherlock sighs. ""Either they didn't find anything or they did and he's keeping it to himself."" He frowns. 

""John, if you wanted to hide something that you didn't want found where would you put it?""

""My mum never let us under her bed."" John said after a moment's thought. ""Harry and I used to play hide and seek, but we weren't allowed to hide under their bed."" 

""Bedroom?"" Sherlock asks, already heading towards the stairs.

""Up the stairs, first door on the left.""

John watches Sherlock bound up the stairs. But he stays in the lounge, turning in a small circle and looking around the room.

""I want my kids to have this. A home, a place to be happy."" he said softly, then sits down on the sofa and holds his mother's blanket close to his face.

Sherlock searches John's parents room, he looks at the pictures on the walls and what sort of people John's parents were. He inspects the floor where John's parents bed where, crawling on his hands and knees. 

He feels the floorboards, testing for any loose ones, and knocks on them to see if there's a hollow sound. He gets to a panel that would have been on John's father's side of the bed and it wiggles just slightly. 

It takes Sherlock a minute to get it up but the panel comes loose and he pulls out his phone. When he turns on the light he sees a stash of papers. ""John!"" He calls out.

Sherlock's voice pulls John from his reverie. Placing his mother's blanket back on the sofa he hurries up the stairs, ignoring the echoes of laughter and his mother singing. He finds Sherlock on his knees beside the bed. His back is to the door, so it isn't until John steps into the room and walks to Sherlock that he sees the papers.

""What is that? Oh god, if you tell me they're love letters I will throw up.""

""Well some of them are. And there's some photos that you probably shouldn't see."" Sherlock chuckles softly. ""But look. He, your father. He was digging as well."" He hands John some papers as he reaches deeper into the floor.

""Digging?"" John asks, then his jaw drops open when Sherlock hands him a stack. 

Written in his father's hand were the words ""Soulmate?"" and ""How it should be.""

Posting from my phone so I didn't do a quick once over for typos. Sorry!!

Boom...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""He knew... I mean, yeah he knew. We can feel it. But he was searching for more like us?"" John asks, leafing through the papers and reading snippets of his dad's research. ""What else is in there, except... god, sex pictures? Gross.""

""They're quite tasteful."" Sherlock hums as he looks at the pictures.

""Oi!"" John yelps, shoving a palm against Sherlock's shoulder. ""Stop looking at my mum while humming."" He laughs, and tries to yank the picture free without looking at it, but ends up getting an eyeful anyway.

""Gross, put that back. I don't need to know that my mum had sex.""

""I won't tell you that you have her arse then."" Sherlock chuckles and puts the pictures away, looking through the letters.

""Fuck off,"" John says fondly, shoving Sherlock a bit with his hip.

""Christ, they took those while me and Harry were just down the hall."" He pinches the bridge of his nose then sighs, accepting the fact that his parents were as madly in love as he and Sherlock were. ""I guess, I can't blame them. When you're looking up at me while I'm on top... I want to freeze the moment and remember the expression you get. It's half dorky, half wonder. I love it.""

""We can talk pictures if you want. Video even. Up to you."" Sherlock smirks. ""Just goes to show it's possible to have an active adventurous sex life while being parents."" He smiles.

""Alright right, enough about my parent's sex life thank you. What else is in my dad's hole."" John groans and slaps his hand over his face, instantly regretting his choice of words. ""The hole in the floor... I mean.""

Sherlock bursts into loud roaring laughter, curled up on the floor and holding his stomach from laughing so hard. ""His.."" He laughs. ""Hole!""

John hip checks his mate but ends up joining Sherlock on the floor laughing. He sits with his back against his parent's bed and laughs until tears come to his eyes.

""I guess I haven't magically inherited your eloquent way of words. Left that part out of the bond sharing experience, did you?""

Sherlock giggles and kisses John happily. ""You're perfect."" He kisses him again.

""Snogging in my parent's room feels a bit dirty."" John says, shifting closer. ""But, seeing how they have a secret cubby full of softcore porn, and secret research... I think they'd approve.""

""I should hope so. They'd probably be proud we found each other. Found our own soulmates. It just goes to prove everything they were trying to do."" Sherlock hums.

""Would snogging in your old room be more or less dirty?"" He nuzzles him.

""Oh yes, on my single-person bed, built for a kid, not a grown man. Brilliant idea."" John laughs then pulls away and glares at him. ""Wait, you just want to go see my room. Don't you?""

""Maybe but I also want to kiss you, so."" Sherlock shrugs. ""Besides I know kissing in here turns you on."" He smirks. ""It feels dirty and like we could get caught.""

""Feels like at any moment someone's going to walk in and catch me with my hands down my pants."" John says around a slow kiss. ""Come on, come see my room. I'm curious to see what Harry left, and what she boxed up.""

Standing John leads the way down the hall and pauses at the door. ""I took a lot of it with me when we moved, it's probably just old posters, maybe some action figures..."" he shrugs and pushes the door open.

The room instantly smells like home to him. His tiny bed is pushed against one wall, beside it is a desk where he used to do his homework. Star Wars posters line the walls and there's a partially empty bookcase sitting beside the door. John turns the light on and steps inside, letting Sherlock follow him in.

""Pretty bare..."" he says softly, though in his eyes he can see the room how it used to be. ""Figured out how to have my first wank in that bed, so I guess that's something.""

""Care to reenact it for me?"" Sherlock teases as he looks around.

""Why, have you taken up a sudden interest in the sturdiness of bed frames made in the 70's?"" John asks with a smirk while moving to sit on his old bed.

""Because I could show you if you'd like. Or you can get their hands-on experience.""

""Mmm yes please."" Sherlock grins and kneels in front of John.

It never ceases to amaze John just how fast the two of them can go from fully clothed to stark naked. In less than thirty seconds his and Sherlock's clothing lay piled on the floor and John stretched out against his old bed. His feet hang off the edge, making him giggle at the absurdity. Sherlock watches, eyes bright and hungry, as John reaches down and begins to stroke his cock.

""Watch me, Sherlock."" he says softly as he begins to toy with his own cock.

It's nothing like the fast desperate wanks he used to have in this bed. He knows what he likes by now. Knows how to swipe his fingers over the glans, and apply pressure at the base. It isn't just yanking and hoping for the best. Sherlock's eyes are pools of silver above him. He reaches out and slides his hand over Sherlock's stomach then lets out a surprised sigh as a trickle of slick makes its way out of him.

""Fuck me,"" he says firmly, lifting his legs and wrapping them around Sherlock's hips. ""I need you inside me. Please?""

""Needy omega."" Sherlock chuckles and it would sound more convincing if his cock wasn't leaking already. He holds John's hips and sinks his cock into John, groaning. ""Slick. So slick for me.""

John groans and pushes against Sherlock. He'd expected Sherlock to be met with some resistance. Between heats like this, it shouldn't be possible to have effortless sex with an Alpha's cock. And there certainly should not be any slick. But his body is pleasantly receptive, and instead of questioning it he pushes in and lets Sherlock sink deep inside him.

""Always need you, Sherlock,"" he says ""Always.""

Sherlock kisses John deeply, holding him close and rocking his hips, pressing deep into his omegas. He knew logically that it shouldn't be this easy to fuck John outside of a heat but his alpha side is enjoying being inside his omega.

""I'm here. All yours. Always."" Sherlock kisses and sucks on his bond mark.

The bed is too small for both of them, and the frame creaks ominously beneath them. But that doesn't slow either of them down. John coaxes his Alpha along, hands clawing at any part of Sherlock he can reach.

""Teeth..."" John hisses, presenting his neck to his Alpha. ""please, Sherlock.""

Sherlock gives into his omega's wants, giving John his bite as his thrusts rub his omega's prostate. John's climax crashes around him too fast. He feels like he's barely gotten Sherlock where he wants him when it happens. Too soon, but somehow perfect at the same time. Hot and heavy with a promise of more later. With a cry he raises his hips and pushes hard against Sherlock, missing the knot but full and happy. His muscles clamp down around Sherlock's cock as he lets out a cry of pleasure so loud it echoes off the walls. Come pools on his stomach and he begins to shake, begging Sherlock through his tremors.

""Come in me please. Fill me up. Only you, Sherlock.""

Sherlock thrusts a handful more times and comes hard into John, filling him with cum.

They sprawl on the bed as best they can, and John tries his hardest not to make a mess on his old blankets. After a while, when a mess becomes inevitable, Sherlock goes off in search of something for John to clean up with. He comes back with a bog roll and tosses it apologetically to John. After cleaning up John sits up and cocks his, tilting his neck side to side. Touching his bite he frowns and says, ""doesn't feel any different. Can you see it? Are there new teeth marks?""

Sherlock shakes his head. ""It's already disappearing.""

""Everything we do goes against everything I was programed to expect."" John says softly.""I didn't just want you to bite me. I needed it. We should go read what my dad wrote. I wonder if he and mum noticed this... This bite thing."" He says for lack of a better way to explain it.

Sherlock nods and helps John clean up before getting them dressed again. He follows John back to the room, giving John his father's notes to go through, and then goes through his parent's letters to see if there's anything in there. John curls up on his parent's bed and goes through the notes. Unorganized, as was his dad's habit, it's hard to decipher at first. But he spreads the pages out on the bed and begins putting them into some form of order. He finds two pages full of the same questions John has. Questions about the limit of their bond, why their children seem happier than others, about the instinct to bite and be bitten during sex. It goes on and on leaving John wide eyed. Only some of the questions have answers. He finds them on pages with numbers circled in the corner. The number corresponds to the number question it's answering. He finds a page with his and Harry's names written all over it and settles in to read. He reads silently at first. Then out loud as he reads his dad's theory.

""We often wondered why Harry and John never displayed the docile behavior most toddlers born from an Omega have. From the start Harriot was a spitfire, full of life and lungs ready to tell you just how bored she was.


John on the other hand used his lungs for a purpose. He was curious to the point of driving his mother and I mental. Everything was 'why' or 'what's that'. Our children were the talk of the town, and we considered strange parents.


We even thought ourselves strange until we found another couple with a few children all displaying the same 'loving life' behaviours. It was summer time, and we were at the Ocean. I saw their joint bites and introduced myself.""

""Sherlock... were you listening?"" John asks, flipping the page over to see if there was more. Not finding anything he brings flipping through the other pages to see if his dad had continued the story on another page.

""Hmm?"" Sherlock asks, reading through the letters. They were more personal, about feelings and desires. Life plans. How John's parents decided to run away together for John's mother's heat so they could bond and be together.

""Dad found another couple like them. He thinks there might be some link to the whole soulmate thing and children's behaviours... Not sure. It's mostly his thoughts written down so it's hard to decipher. ""

He sits up a bit and scrubs his hand over his face.

""But remember what my aunt said? Omega's children are docile? I guess Harry and I weren't. Sounds like we were anything but."" He holds the paper out to Sherlock and begins skimming over another one.

""Maybe we can track down the other couple somehow? Are there names or descriptions?"" Sherlock reads.

""From the letters, your dad knew right away that your mum was the one. He says it over and over. She was scared at first. Of what she felt for him. Afraid to admit it because of her family. She was actually the one that suggested they run away a bond."" He hums.

""Why the children? What would soulmate parents have bolder and louder children?"" He frowns as he reads through the papers.

""Maybe because they aren't born into a world of submission?"" John theorizes, glancing up from the papers to his mate. ""Children learn from their parents actions as much as they do from spoken word. And good God, are you saying our children will be bolder and louder than you""

""I'm pretty hard to beat."" Sherlock chuckles. ""I think you're right. Children learn mostly from their omega's in formative years. If the omega is made to be docile and quiet the children will also emulate that. Especially if the alpha is overpowering.""

John hums and nods as he pours over the stack of papers. Afternoon turns to evening and John's stomach begins to growl. He doesn't want to take his eyes off of his dad's work, but he looks up at Sherlock.

""Small town, everything closes early. If we want a chance at dinner we should think about leaving soon. Plus I'd love to walk into the Inn smelling of sex and see the look on Pete's face.""

""We can take the papers with us."" Sherlock nods, his own stomach feeling hungry because of their connection.

""Come on,"" John stands from his parent's bed and carefully picks up the papers from the bed. ""There's a place on our way back. We can get dinner, and I can get a beer.""

Sherlock nods and finds a briefcase in the closet for the papers to go in.

Placing the papers in the briefcase John looks around the room and sighs.

""I'm glad we came here. It's nice to smell home again.""

""We can come back whenever you'd like."" Sherlock rubs John's arm.

John locks up the house and pockets the key, intending to return it to it's hiding spot under the gnome before returning back to London. But for now he considered it his. His responsibility to ensure that his family home remains as secure as possible. He directs Sherlock back to the center of town, replacing his shoes and socks as they drive, then has him pull into a restaurant. He takes the briefcase in with him, somehow unwilling to part with the papers. They get a table in the back and John orders a beer, then places the briefcase on the chair beside him and pops it open. Pulling out the list of questions John begins digging through the other papers. His beer arrives before his food, and before he knows it it's gone and being replaced by another. Sherlock watches the people in the restaurant, dishing out glares and cold stares to those who do the same to them. He decides not to drink, not feeling comfortable enough to let his guard down. He looks at John, watching him go through the papers. He can't put his finger on it but something about this whole thing doesn't feel right.

""Listen to this,"" John says, pointing to a bit of underlined text.


""We learned early on that biting increases fertility if contraceptives are not being used (a fact other couples in our situation all agree upon) and re administering the bond bite during sex does the Omega (Joann) no harm. In fact, it always seems like my teeth find the same spot, over and over again.""


""So, he's saying you biting me, like you did earlier, didn't tear new flesh. Just... kind of... sunk home?"" John looks up at his mate, then takes a swig of his beer, passing the paper over to Sherlock who only half squinted at it.

""Relax, love. The worst that's going to happen is you'll get yelled at for letting me talk so much.""

""Arseholes."" Sherlock mumbles.

He reads the papers and something occurs to him. ""Gland expression?"" He looks at John. ""Biting the same spot of the bond can release hormones from the scent gland in the neck.""

Lifting a hand to the right side of his neck, John fingers his bond mark, then lets out a low whistle.

""Interesting. If that's the case, why didn't I learn about this in medical school?""

""What other properties does it have? Healing? Both physical and emotional? ""The medical field ignores omega's outside of their breeding capabilities."" 

""I suppose it could,"" Sherlock says with a  sigh. We can have a full blood panel worked up on both of us when we get back and compare it before we bonded."" He hums. ""In a letter.. hold on."" He looks through the papers.

""There's a letter your mum wrote. Talking about how she had this really bad flu. And your dad bit her instinctually. Without sex. And she was better within a day."" He hands John the letter.

""So... it's like this magical power that breaks the rules of the universe."" John says, shaking his head and swallowing the last of his second beer.

""People are dying, right now... mates... if only they knew. If only they'd bonded correctly.""

Sherlock frowns and nods. ""I don't know if there's a way to find a mate that doesn't happen by accident.""

""Yeah..."" John sighs, then is forced to move some of the papers when their food is brought out. He orders one more beer, then tucks in.

They continue to read over dinner, John's words becoming more slurred as he progresses through his third beer. They're just being asked if they wanted dessert when a loud explosion from the carpark makes John and Sherlock whip their heads up in surprise. Sherlock pulls out his wallet while John gathers the papers and stuffs them back into the briefcase. Handing over enough money to cover the cheque, Sherlock is up first and is already walking towards the exit when car alarms start to go off. John catches up, stumbling a bit, but keeping one hand firmly on the briefcase. Eyes wide with fear, he looks over at his mate as Sherlock pushes his way out of the emergency exit.

""Sherlock..."" He says softly, as they exit and see their rental car in flames. ""That's... our car.""

""We have to go. Now."" Sherlock grabs John's hand and takes off, needing to get them out of there as fast as possible. He gets them back to the inn and locks the door. He frowns, the room smelling freshly sanitized. ""What the fuck."" He starts to look around and their things have been gone through. He pulls out his phone and calls Mycroft. As soon as the call connects he starts talking.

""Someone just blew up our car. I've had a feeling we've been followed all day. Our room at the inn has been searched."" He growls.

""Wait, what?"" John mutters, looking around at the room. It takes him a lot longer to notice the subtle changes. The hard plastic travel case, which holds John's gun, has been moved from where John had handcuffed it to the bed frame. It was still secure, but John was certain he'd placed the case on it's side. Now it stood on end. He'd never gotten around to unpacking his suitcase, and being ex military, his packing skills were precise. Everything had it's natural place in John's case. Pants and socks in the top corner, then trousers. In the gaps, holding everything tight, would be t shirts. Then on top of those were his shirts he didn't want wrinkled. His pants had been pulled out and replaced below the trousers. After a quick count he growled.

""Pete... he took a pair of my bloody pants.""

Sherlock growls. ""I'll rip his throat out.""

""We need backup."" He growls at Mycroft, angry he's asking for help from Mycroft but he needed to keep his omega safe.

While Sherlock and his brother bicker (more like Sherlock bickering to a brick wall, John senses) John collects his gun and tucks it against the small of his back, covering it with his shirt. Out of habit, he goes to the window and peels back the curtain a smidgen and looks out. Nothing seems out of place, but the hairs on the back of his neck prickle.

""Someone's watching us. I can't see who, but I know they're out there. We nee..."" He stops short and walks to Sherlock, placing a hand over his mouth to silence him. ""Bugs?"" John mouths, looking around the room as if the very walls were listening in.

He pulls out the notebook he carries with him. Flipping to a blank page he writes


Car, text Mycroft... my house?""


Sherlock nods and hangs up the phone. He texts Mycroft to send a car immediately.

It takes less than five minutes for them to gather their belongings. John takes his case, thankful they'd packed light, and gives Sherlock the briefcase and his, motioning towards his gun, indicating he wanted a hand free. Sherlock nods once in understanding, then gives the room one last look, making sure they hadn't forgotten anything. John pulls Sherlock through the Inn, and out the back door. No one is in sight when they leave, but he still can't shake the feeling that someone is watching. Turning to make sure Sherlock is on his heels, he takes off at a sprint, heading away from the center of town towards an old abandoned building he'd once played in. Sherlock follows John close, keeping his eyes out for anyone or anything. The building is little more than bricks and timber now, but it offers some protection. Set back from the road, it also lets them watch for anyone coming. Sherlock pings Mycroft their location, then sits with his back against John's. Each of them watching the end of the road.

""So... Someone knows we're digging, and wants to kill us?"" John asks, keeping his voice low. ""Why?""

""I don't know.. either we know something they want to know or they don't want us to find something out. We need more data. And security.."" Sherlock frowns, holding the briefcase close.

""Bad timing and all.."" John says, getting up, ""But I need a piss.""

He doesn't go far, the building and the cover of dark provide enough shelter that he knows he doesn't risk a charge for public indecency. But he goes far enough that neither he or Sherlock will have to smell it while they wait.

Coming back, he settles into the same spot and rests his head against Sherlock.

""I fail to see how this is so dangerous,"" he complains, knowing that Sherlock was as confused as he was.

""We weren't followed up here. I would have noticed someone trailing us for five hours...""

""No. They were waiting. Waiting for us. Waiting for someone to come digging."" Sherlock frowns. ""Maybe your dad knew more than we think.""

""Think there is more in the house somewhere? If he had one hidden compartment, chances are good he'd have two or more."" John drags his hand through his hair and stiffens. ""Lights, coming my way. Car, it looks like, not torches.""

Sherlock stiffens and looks at the car. ""Mycroft said there'd be a signal.""

The car pulls up and the door opens, classical music pouring out.

Sherlock relaxes. ""It's our ride."" He nods and leads John out, the song being a piano and violin duet mummy used to make Sherlock and Mycroft play.

John doesn't relax once he's in the car. His gun presses against his back, reminding him of the danger lurking in the night. His hand instinctively finds Sherlock's and he squeezes their fingers together.

""I'm glad we have a habit of working over dinner... if those papers had been in the car."" he says, ""Not only would we lose information... but... it's my dads...""

""I know."" Sherlock kisses Johns knuckles. ""I'm sure Mycroft will have us under surveillance now just in case if anything. Well have him send us a scanner and we can copy all the papers.""

John nods, and settles back, letting Sherlock comfort him through their bond. When they get back to his house, John has the driver stop down the street. With the car idling, John looks over at Sherlock and purses his lips. He knows Sherlock won't like what he's about to propose, but it's their best option.

""Wait here. It will take me two minutes to walk to the house, another five to clear it. If you don't hear from me in eight minutes, you are to drive off and get back up. Keep my dad's research safe.""

Sherlock opens his mouth to argue but John silences him with a kiss.

""All three of us going together won't end well. I know how to clear a building, you don't. You being here, with the means to escape is the best option.""

Sherlock frowns. ""Take the agent.""

""No,"" John says firmly, kissing Sherlock once more. ""No.""

Before Sherlock has time to complain John's stepping out of the car and gripping his gun. Flicking the safety off, he took off at a brisk walk towards his childhood house. Glad that the key had been in his pocket, and not in the rental car, he slipped in quietly through the back and went over the house room by room. When he reached Harry's old room, he pulled down the staircase to the attic and checked the crawl space above. The home empty, he leaned against the nearest wall and pulled his mobile out. Seven minutes had passed, so he sent a short text.



All clear



Then went back to the living room to wait. Not liking the way the shadows made his home feel unsafe, he turned on all the lights downstairs while he waited. Sherlock goes in as soon as he gets the text. ""I should be angry at you for putting yourself in danger like that but it's also hot so.. it balances out.""

""I know,"" John says, letting his Alpha pull him into a strong embrace. ""I am a bit sexy when I go all James Bond, aren't I?""

Sherlock hums and nods, holding John close. ""It is. It turns me on when you're all cool and suave and in charge."" He mumbles and kisses John deeply. 

Mycroft's underling clears his throat in the doorway, but John just waves him off. His fight-or-flight no longer in high gear, and the adrenaline wearing off, he feels shaky and a bit sick to his stomach. But Sherlock's scent, and his hands along his back, sooth his tense body, and soon he's just left with his gut rolling.

""We can sleep in my parents bed tonight, I guess..."" John says, wrinkling his nose. ""Though, I don't need you deducing anything about how they slept."" His stomach clenches and he groans, flopping down on the sofa. ""If I had known we'd be running for our lives I wouldn't have had three beers.""

""I'll flip the mattress and make the bed."" Sherlock goes to get John a glass of water before making the bed.

John tries to drink the water, but just one sip of it makes his stomach threaten to upheave. When Sherlock comes back downstairs, he's curled up on his side with his mother's blanket draped over him.

""John?"" Sherlock frowns and kneels next to him, pressing his hand to John's forehead.

""Fine."" John says softly then forces himself to sit up. ""Just tired from the drive. Then ate too much, and probably drank too much."" Forcing a smile on his face he turns to the third man in the room. ""What are the chances of getting more backup, so Sherlock and I can sleep? Maybe some food delivered, and toiletries?""

The man simply nods, then steps away while lifting his phone to his ear.

""Something tells me someone should be awake at all times,"" John explains, pulling Sherlock with him towards the stairs, ""But we've been on our feet all bloody day, and neither of us are in the right frame of mind to stay up and stare at shadows.""

""I'm sure Mycroft is sending more. The agent arrived too soon to be from the city. He was here already."" Sherlock helps John up and takes him up to bed, keeping John's mother's blanket around him.

Wanting a shower, but remembering from his walkthrough that the bathroom had been empty of everything save for a single roll of toilet paper, John lets Sherlock bundle him into bed.

""Used to sleep in here, during storms."" John said softly, as he kicked his trousers off and shoved them over the edge of the bed with his feet. ""Seems silly now, to be afraid of thunder.""

""It's loud and jarring and the wind makes noises outside. It's perfectly logical."" Sherlock helps John into bed. ""Let me get a bowl or something in case you feel sick.""

John tries to shrug Sherlock off, but the effort makes his head spin. Thankfully faint scents of his parents lull him into a half asleep state. He stirs when Sherlock enters the room, and shuts the door behind him.

""Should we be worried about your brother snatching up the papers while we sleep?""

""I have them here,"" Sherlock says and puts the briefcase under the mattress. ""They won't be able to get it without waking us.""

Oh hey! An explosion!? Interesting....


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

On the morning of the third day spent back in his childhood home, John wakes up hoping to find his stomach settled. Instead, he rolls out of bed and rushes to the bathroom, doing his best to get sick as quietly as possible, not wanting to face Sherlock's concerned eyes.

He hadn't been much help over the last few days while Sherlock searched the house. He'd mostly been on the sofa, nibbling biscuits and watered down tea.

Washing his face, he sits on the edge of the tub while scrubbing a toothbrush over his teeth to rid himself of the taste of bile. As far as bugs went, it was mild, but he was glad that Sherlock hadn't caught it yet.

""John? Are you alright?"" Sherlock knocks gently at the door. He didn't like this. Not one bit. ""Maybe you should see a doctor? You've barely been able to keep anything down for days now. That's not like you. I've never seen you vomit before this week."" He raises the urge to pace. His mate is sick and he doesn't know why.

""Just a bug, love."" John says after spitting into the sink and washing the toothpaste down the drain. ""Probably got it from one of the kids at my aunts.""

He opens the door and smiles weakly at his mate. ""Plus, I am a doctor. Technically I just saw one, when I looked in the mirror.""

Sherlock frowns and nuzzles John since John had banned kisses so Sherlock doesn't catch anything even though Sherlock argued that doesn't make sense.

""I don't like seeing you like this."" He mumbles. He had found several more stashes of papers and even some interviews with other couples, anonymous.

""Close your eyes then?"" John jokes as he pulls from Sherlock's embrace.

""Think I'll try some toast today, if you're willing to make me some."" He says, heading downstairs while his stomach wasn't rolling. ""Hopefully today I can start scanning these pages into a computer.""

Over the past two days, John had managed to create a sort of system. He'd taken multi coloured folders and had sorted the pages into three stacks.

One containing letters written by his parents. Another for the questions his dad wrote down, and their answers, which were easily spotted by the number circled in the top corner. The third folder contained anything else they'd found. Newspaper clippings, copies of bonding certificates and reports, and letters written by other people to his parents.

He'd been too busy sorting to stop and read much, but having a system created would make life easier for both of them.

""Ha Ha."" Sherlock mocks a laugh at John's joke and follows him downstairs. He goes to make John some toast and gets him some electrolyte drink that helps vomiting.

It takes him twenty minutes, but John manages to eat the toast, and most of his drink while sitting up on the sofa. Reaching for a new stack of papers he glances through the topmost pages, then stops short.

""Sherlock!"" He calls. When Sherlock enters the room looking scared, John rolls his eyes. ""I'm fine, but look at this.""

He holds the picture up and shows him the photocopy of his parent's bonding records. It includes photos and all the documents John had just had to sign. But among the photos was a picture of his dad, for once smiling straight at the camera, with a fresh bite on his neck.

""Dad did it too... had them record it.""

""Oh wow.."" Sherlock subconsciously reaches up and rubs his neck as he looks at the picture.

""Not sure if it helps us though,"" John says, scrubbing a hand over his face. ""Truthfully, I don't even know what we're looking for.""

""At first I think we were looking for proof and we found that."" Sherlock nods to the papers. ""Now we have to figure out what to do with it..""

""Finding proof got our car blown up."" Sighing John slumps back against the sofa and pushes the rest of his drink away from where the scent won't bother him as much. ""Something tells me if we keep digging worse will happen... Is Mrs. Hudson safe?""

Sherlock nods. ""Mycroft is watching her. I had her go to her sister's."" He sits with John.

""Are there any more, you think? In the house?"" He asks, looking around imagining papers lining the walls.

""He spent a lot of time in his shed out back... we should check there as well."" John looks over at Sherlock and notes how his brows are furrowed. With a grunt, he kicks Sherlock's shins.

""Would you stop looking at me like I'm dying? Look, I've kept the toast down.""

""I know. I.. You smell off.."" Sherlock frowns, trying to figure out if a sickness can make someone smell different.

""Smell off?"" John says while narrowing his eyes. ""I shouldn't smell different because of a bug. I don't think.""

John lifts his wrist to his nose and inhales, wondering what it is that Sherlock's smelling. All he smells is skin, and home, and something soft.

""What's it smell like?""

""I don't know. It's subtle. Mild. Maybe it's because you're home?"" Sherlock frowns and leans in, sniffing John.

""Probably."" John agrees. ""I haven't been home since... well, mum. So it makes sort of sense. It's probably an emotional response.""

John's stomach begins to complain again, so he distracts Sherlock by giving him a push. ""Go check out the shed. Should be a key by the door before you exit the kitchen.""

Sherlock sighs and nods. ""Fine. If you need me or find something call me."" He finally gets up and heads to the back door.

As soon as Sherlock is out the door, John is up and heading for the nearest bathroom. Not for the first time in his life, he hugs the cold porcelain as he upends the contents of his meager breakfast.

Annoyed, but feeling slightly better not having anything in his stomach, he heads back to the living room and begins sorting through the papers once more.

Sherlock is outside for an hour. When he finally comes back in he's carrying a dirty rusted waterproof safe box.

John takes one look at the box and feels a wave of emotion roll over him. He'd seen his dad with that box countless times. While he and Harry had been playing in the back garden, their dad would sit inside his shed, hunched over something with that very box between his feet.

John had always assumed it held tools, but now looking at it he realized he'd been watching his dad try to solve the very problem they were now having.

It gave him an idea. Ignoring Sherlock's questioning gaze John goes upstairs and into his old room. It takes him a few minutes to go through the boxes but eventually he finds it. The book his mother used to read to him. The one that told the tale of Alphas and Omegas living in harmony.

He hurries back downstairs and goes into the kitchen, finding a knife. Then he does the one thing his book-loving heart swore to never do. Taking care not to damage anything, John slices the book blot from the case. He's barely got it off when something flutters to the ground.

Placing the knife down he bends down and picks up a yellowed sheet of paper. Turning to Sherlock, who was now watching him with curiosity, he says.

""Mum always said there was more to this story than the eye could see. I always thought she meant the pictures.""

""They certainly left a trail for you,"" Sherlock says softly.


 My sweet John, 



 Your father and I have devoted our lives to giving you and your sister the best lives we can. But I'm afraid we've stumbled upon something that might shatter our happy nest. We've taken every precaution we could, but still, it wasn't enough. 



 We've been looking into our bond, and finding people like us. Along the way, we've stirred up the hornet's nest. A group of men, unnamed as far as we can tell, approached us while we were on holiday and warned us to stop digging. 



 Your father is... was... a curious man. He refused to their faces, telling them we had every right to know more about our bonds than the government told us. I'm afraid it was foolish, though I applaud his bravery. 



 Last night I watched my Mate. My soulmate suffered what the doctors say was a natural heart attack. Only, I could feel that it wasn't his body betraying him, but something forging. The doctors wouldn't listen when I begged them to check him for poisoning... 



 My dear boy, your dad and I share a unique bond. A bond so rare that we thought we were alone in the world with our discovery. Over the years, the bond grew so strong that I could sense him his body, his mind, even his location. I just knew, even though I didn't know how I knew. 



 Last night I felt that presence vanish. Something I hope you'll never have to feel. I had hoped for more time. To be there when you're grown and to tell you about this bond. But I feel my life is destined for the same fate as Hank's. All we can do is leave clues behind, nudge you in the right direction, and hope you're wise enough to find the answers we could not. 



 If anyone can, it is you, my love. You've always been the smart one, no offense to your sister, but she thinks with her Alpha brain. Find the answers, John. Learn what your father could not. But be safe, protect yourself and your family, if you have one. I love you, and so did your father. 



 -Mum 


John reads the letter, noting the places where her tears had smudged the ink. He feels behind him for a chair and sinks heavily into it. The weight of his mother's words drags his heart into his stomach.

He looks up at Sherlock with tears in his eyes and passes over the letter.

""Oh, John."" Sherlock kneels at John's feet as he reads.

""Yeah..."" Is all John manages to say before he can't see or think through the tears.

Sherlock's arms engulf his body. For once John finds himself happy for his small frame. He wants to curl into a ball and exist only in Sherlock's embrace.

""Murder, then?"" John croaks.

""I think so.."" Sherlock says softly, holding John tight and scenting him.

""Fuck"" it's the only thing John can think go say. What else can you say when faced with a situation like this.

Sherlock holds John and rocks him slowly. He picks John up and carries him to bed.

John lets himself be Alpha-handled. Oddly enough it calms his stomach, letting Sherlock put him to bed like a small child. He clings to the bed first, then Sherlock when his mate slips between the blankets.

Wrapped up in his parent's bed he cries harder than he's cried since the day his mum died. He cries until there's nothing left in him, and all he can manage are full body shakes. Clinging to Sherlock's damp shirt he whispers, ""we need to be careful. I can't lose you.""

""I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you."" Sherlock holds John close and scents him. He didn't want to involve Mycroft any more than he was but Mycroft's people could keep them safer.

""Whatever you want to do we'll do. We can stop digging. Lay low."" He says softly, knowing John wouldn't let this go.

""Lay low, and let whoever murdered my father to remain free?"" John sits up and shakes his head. ""No. This is what we do. Solve crimes and put horrible people in jail.""

He wipes his eyes and clears his throat. ""This time it's personal. I just have to not get caught up in the emotion. We should visit my Uncle, my dad's brother. I wonder if he believes my Mum.""

""Well, he may have a clearer head about everything since he's a beta. Seeing things from an outsider perspective as it was."" Sherlock rubs John's back.

""If I don't eat or drink anything... I should be fine to go today."" John says then begins patting the blankets to find his mobile.

Sherlock finds it first and hands it over. Taking it John texts his Uncle and sets up a time to meet him later that day.

""He said he'll come here tonight after he gets off work.""

""You can't starve yourself."" Sherlock frowns, already planning out ways to drag John to the doctor's if he needs to.

""No, but I can hold off on eating directly before he gets here."" John sighs turning on the bed to face his mate. ""Face it. No one else is sick, not you, and unfortunately not any of your brother's underlings. I thought it was the beer, then I thought it was food poisoning. Now I just think it's stress.""

He knows Sherlock isn't completely convinced so he continues.

""We're recently bonded, my body is still trying to figure out how to be an Omega who isn't on suppressants or contraceptives. Then I come back here,"" he gestures to the room and the house. ""my system is going haywire. It's probably why I didn't get pregnant during my last heat.""

Sherlock frowns and cuddles John close. He does make a compelling argument. ""I just.. for some reason I'm not convinced. My instincts itch."" He nuzzles John.

""Now if I were pregnant this would all make sense. The extra sensitivity,"" John looks at the spot on Sherlock's shirt that is still damp from his tears, ""and then this could all just be chalked up to be morning sickness.""

He gets up off the bed and grimaces as the few remaining contents in his stomach slosh.

""Instead it's just another way my body is biting me in the arse for suppressing the natural order for so long.""

Sherlock sits up and watches John. ""If you throw up one more time I'm taking you to the hospital whether I have to carry you or drag you.""

""Remember who owns the gun in this relationship, Sherlock,"" John warns gently. ""I'm in no mood to have doctors shove their equipment up my arse just because I'm an Omega. I'm going back downstairs. We still have a lot of work to do.""

""This isn't about me trying to control you, John. This is about me trying to make sure you're alright. And if I have to protect you from yourself then I will. You'd the same and more for me. You have in the past. Just because we're working this case where everything is so omega and alpha focused don't forget that I never gave a toss about any of it and I still don't. You may not be in the mood to be poked and prodded but if you're sick I will not let you die from your own stubbornness."" Sherlock's face is hard and determined. ""So threatening me with your gun. You already know that I'd die to protect you so it's a moot point.""

John crosses his arms and turns to face Sherlock. He's ready to fight, but even as he opens his mouth to tell Sherlock where he can shove it something crosses over their bond. He can feel Sherlock's concern. It's palpable and deep, settling into John's mind like a weighted blanket. He reminds himself that Sherlock hasn't seen the battlefield, not like he has. He hasn't seen dying men or heard their moans. What Sherlock is seeing right now, is his mate suffering from something modern medicine can cure.

""Give me until tomorrow at least?"" He asks in a defeated tone. ""I already threw up breakfast while you were out in the shed, so it's safe to say lunch will go down just as well..."" He drags a hand through his hair and sighs he can feel Sherlock's concern deepen. ""If I can't keep down breakfast tomorrow, I'll go, you won't have to drag me.""

""Thank you,"" Sherlock says softly, upset John didn't tell him he grew up breakfast but relieved John agrees to go to the doctor if it continues.

""I love you,"" Sherlock says, he always says it after they have an argument or a small spat. He needs to make sure John hears it as well as feels it.

""Mmm,"" John says, nodding and walking to Sherlock. He wraps his arms around Sherlock's waist and sighs. ""I love you too, you git.""

He stays in Sherlock's arms for a long while. Sherlock's scent helps calm his stomach and nerves. Soon his breathing has returned to normal and the last traces of his tears are gone. Looking up into the face he'd grown so used to seeing by his side he smiles and nods his head towards the door. ""Bring me down a box of books, I'll go through them for any loose papers and I'll try to keep down some biscuits.""

""Okay."" Sherlock smiles and kisses John's forehead before doing as John says.

The morning ticks by minute by long minute. Around lunchtime Sherlock brings John another bottle of electrolyte-infused water, and a packet of hobnobs. An hour goes by before John realizes that he's eaten half the packet of biscuits, and consumed two drinks, without throwing up. Pleased, but not wanting to make a big deal out of it, he simply returns to the stack of papers and books.

Not wanting to tear open every book his family had ever owned, John instead ran his fingers along the covers and inspected the corners for lifting glue. Once he thought he'd found something, only to cut the book open and find it was just old and worn. He was just beginning to grow frustrated when Sherlock looked up from the stack of books he'd been pouring over and held up one of his mother's gardening books, his eyes bright with discovery.

""What? What did you find?"" John asked quickly.

""It's not a book, John. It's a journal. Your mother's journal."" Sherlock grins. ""Your dad's notes are all on loose papers. Your mum kept things more organized. Hidden in plain sight."" He passes the book to John. He notices how John is keeping down his snacks and drink but doesn't say anything in case it somehow jinxed John's progress.

John reaches for it eagerly and flips through the pages. He smiles, seeing more of his mother's flowery handwriting in neat straight lines.

""Got my handwriting from my dad, and note-taking skills from her,"" John says fondly while skimming over the first few pages. The first entries talk about life as a young teenager, what it was like to expect her first heat, knowing that after it was over she'd be eligible to be paired with an Alpha. As he reads her write about knowing her life would soon be over, that she'd be sold off to whichever Alpha was willing to pay for her, his stomach turned. But this time it wasn't the queasy feeling that came from eating bad food. This was anger manifesting into something tangible.

His mother describes meeting the man who'd placed a bid on her. The panic she felt at meeting a man twice her age. He traces his fingers over her words and feels his heartbreak for her. He had known that life hadn't been sunshine and rainbows for her, but hearing her describe it in such vivid detail made him angry.

""How could anyone do that to their child..."" he seethes to the pages, then reads on. What he reads next makes his heart stop. With a tremor in his voice, he calls Sherlock's name to get his attention. ""Sherlock, listen...""


Hank and I were in love. From the moment we met on the first day of Year 9, we knew. He was two weeks older than me, a point he teased me about endlessly. We had plans to marry and start a family, but when my parents introduced me to my intended Alpha our fantasy came crashing down.



I was barely sixteen and late presenting. All the other Omegas in our class had already experienced their first heat. But I wasn't worried, it gave Hank and I that much more time together.



My parents indulged our dating, if only because they knew it would be over soon. So when Hank showed up one night, dressed to the nines with a bouquet of flowers, asking if I'd like to see a film with him, no one objected. We did see that film, though we were too busy snogging to watch most of it. Then after, we ended up at his place and found his parents out. As teenagers might... we had each other that night. He looked at me, looming over me in the darkness of his room and asked me four words I'd been longing to hear. Can I bite you?



We didn't think it would create a bond, as I hadn't had my first heat yet. We just wanted to know what it felt like. He bit me, and I bit back. By the time we were spent, we knew it had been for real. I could feel him inside my soul, and he said the same. We cuddled until we heard his parents come home, then Hank snuck me out the back. My family was asleep, so I had no trouble getting to my room without being spotted.



I was fortunate enough to have a stomach bug for the next week, giving me time to find a way to hide my bond bite. If my parents saw, surely they would have forced me to have it removed. He was concerned over my illness, calling the house to check in on me. But when I returned to school, using a scarf to cover my neck, his eyes widened and I swear I've never seen that man look so panicked in my life. He pulled me into an empty classroom and shoved his nose against my stomach. A test from the chemist later that afternoon proved what his instincts already knew. I was pregnant.


We devised a plan, a fake heat where we'd claim to bond. The heat and bonding resulting in my pregnancy. Knowing that there was still a chance that my intended Alpha would take me, and Hank's child. But it was our best option. And thankfully for us, it worked.""

Sherlock listens intently and frowns. ""She didn't have a heat? She got pregnant without.."" Suddenly it dawns on Sherlock and he pushes John back against the couch. He ignores John's protests as he pulls John's jumper up and presses his nose to his belly, sniffing.

Pup his instincts supply as soon as he smells the soft delicate scent. He looks up at John, wide-eyed and frozen. For the first time in his whole life, his mind is still and silent beyond one work. Pup

John's still mumbling about being manhandled when Sherlock's eyes meet his. He looks like a rabbit in the headlights, wide-eyed and unsure which way to jump. He starts to push Sherlock away when his much slower mind catches up. He looks from the letter to Sherlock, then down to his stomach. He can hear the low buzz of conversation from two of Mycroft's agents in the other room, but he pushes them out of his mind.

""Oh... you mean? I'm..."" He places a hand on his stomach, just above Sherlock's head. There's nothing to feel, of course, but somehow focusing on the area feels right. ""We're... going to be parents?""

Sherlock nods slowly as his brain comes back online, processing everything. ""Pup."" He said since it's the only word rattling around in his skull.

""We should do a test, to be sure,"" John says though the thought is laughable. If this was the result of their coupling from the other night, surely it would be too soon for any over-the-counter test. ""But how? And why'd I get sick the next day? Morning sickness usually comes later.""

Sherlock doesn't seem willing, or able, to move so he lays back against the sofa and lets his mate scent his stomach. It's strange and ticklish, but it calms his upset stomach. When Sherlock sticks his tongue out and begins licking, John puts a hand in Sherlock's hair and laughs. ""Scenting is one thing, but licking me like I'm a damned ice lolly is another.""

""Pup. Our pup. Inside you."" Sherlock mumbles as he rubs his face against John's stomach. His brain was seemingly very slow to come back online and his instincts guiding him.

""Guess you get to drag me to the doctors after all."" John groans, but he's smiling. Carding his fingers through Sherlock's hair he silently thanks his mother for documenting everything.

Sherlock kisses and nuzzles John's belly. ""Mm, it all makes sense. Why omega's can only get pregnant during a heat. That's because it's not with their soulmate. That's why conception rates are so low. They're only fertile a handful of times a year. Soulmates can have pups whenever without a heat."" He mumbles, his brain working things out.

""Everything. Everything points to soulmates being the correct way. Selling omega's means controlling the supply of births. Less omega's mean higher prices which keep the rich and elite in power because they're the ones producing omega's. They don't care about betas having children unless by a miracle it turns out to be an omega. This is the way it's supposed to be. Finding your soulmate. Being connected. Content."" He rambles, brain making connections.

Sherlock remembers the day John came into the lab at Bart's. How each of his hairs stood on end and his alpha howled. It didn't make sense to him, how his instincts were so drawn to this beta when he never cared to be close to anyone before. How he thought of any reason to keep John in his life. Give him excitement, purpose, heal his leg, somewhere to live, companionship.

""I knew.."" He says after being silent for some time. ""I knew when you came into Bart's. I couldn't think. It was so distracting. I had to get out. And then you moved in and stayed. It only got more intense. Lestrade, I told him. I told him what I was thinking and feeling because I didn't know what it meant. I'd never felt like that before or thought that way before. He gave me a look like he pitied me but he was happy at the same time?"" He says, still confused.

""He said I was in love with you and I told him that was ridiculous. I didn't have feelings like that for anyone. Never had and how I doubted it would be for a beta who was careful to keep his distance from me except when we had to pretend to be a couple."" He's still rambling but he can't help it, all of this had been in his head for so long and now it made sense.

He presses his nose to John's belly again, trying to smell more. It smells like him and John and something new. Sweet. Fragile.

""No more. No more selling omega's to the highest bidder. No more unfulfilled soulmates. We'll figure it out. There has to be a way to figure it out. Blood samples or pheromones or something. There has to be something tangible. Something we can quantify and connect. To bring mates together. They deserve this. This feeling. This connection. Where secondary sex doesn't dictate what box they have to live in the rest of their life but a freedom to be who they are and do what they want."" Sherlock rubs John's tighs, still kneeling between his legs.

He needs data, proof. Samples from soulmates and similarities so they can find a way to track and match soulmates together. He can't imagine going through life the way he had before. He didn't know how empty it was. How alone he felt. How he was just drifting and doing what he thought was what he wanted.

""Our pups will not grow up like this. I won't have it. They won't be oppressed and made to conform for the likes of dullard uneducated masses. Whoever blew up our car knows. They know all this and more. We have to figure out who that is."" He growls softly.

John listens to his Alpha, petting his head in a soothing manner. Sherlock's voice softens the edges of his panic and shock. He thinks back to their first meeting and smiles. Remembering the brash man, with the shirt collar undone.

""When I saw you, I thought I'd either like to fuck him or tell him to fuck off. You were a pretty boy, after my life in the military. It was like seeing colour again, after seeing nothing but camouflage and sand for years. It scared me how I didn't want to stop looking at you. I didn't want to be seen as the mooning Omega, drooling at the closest Alpha.""

The rest of Sherlock's words sink in and he nods grimly. The most important case they could ever imagine had just been dropped on their laps, and all they had to go by was his parent's notes, and whispers in the wind.

Sherlock nuzzles and sniffs John's belly for a bit longer. ""You do realize I knocked you up on your childhood bed in your parent's house."" He snorts against John's belly.

""For fucks sake..."" John groans and finally manages to push Sherlock's head off of him. They catch each other's eyes and the unbridled mirth in Sherlock's gaze makes John burst out laughing. He laughs until his sides hurt then rolls his eyes so hard they risk rolling back into his skull. ""Better than my parent's bed,"" he laughs out.

Their noise brings one of the agents in, investigating what the ruckus was about. When neither John nor Sherlock is forthcoming, he shrugs and walks away. Clearly not finding manic laughter a security risk.

Sherlock grins and licks his lips. ""My mate. Pregnant with my pup."" He all but purrs, his alpha side deeply pleased.

""Good news, I'm not dying,"" John says, wiping a tear from the corner of his eye and stamping down the last of his laughter. Rubbing his stomach he smiles fondly at his Mate then tugs his jumper back down. ""Can't believe my mum got pregnant without even having her first heat. And they faked it! You heard Aunt Jennie, she said they were gone for days, she came back bonded and pregnant. It was a bloody coverup!""

""Quite ingenious on their part."" Sherlock chuckles, resisting the urge to push John's jumper back up and plastering himself to his belly. ""I'll look through the rest of your mum's books and see if she left any more journals.""

""I can't imagine the fear... Bonding to the person you loved while knowing that your Alpha parent was in the midst of negotiating your sale. They're lucky he didn't push to finalize that sale..."" John sits back up and prepares to go back over the rest of the entry, but stops short. ""Do you think he had my dad killed?""

""I... I don't know. We have to find out who it was that was going to buy your mother."" Sherlock frowns.

""We can ask my Uncle tonight, if not, we can see if my aunt knows."" John grimaces at the thought of returning to her house, but the answers they need outweigh any of his personal discomforts.

Finding himself hungry, he wanders into the kitchen and makes himself toast, while the kettle boils.

""We're not going back to see her. Whatever she knows we can find out some other way."" Sherlock follows John, not letting more than a few feet of space between them.

John puts teabags into two mugs then frowns.

""Am I okay having caffeine? Christ, I can't remember...""

""It's fine. Just try and limit it to one cup a day."" Sherlock says, having read as much as he could on the do's and don'ts when they were trying to get pregnant before.

John lets out a relieved sigh, pours hot water into the cups, and pops the bread into the toaster. While waiting for the bread to brown he pulls Sherlock into his arms.

""Pup... or, pups?"" He says happily, ""explains why my stomach felt better any time you were close, and probably why those damn hobnobs didn't bother me. They're going to be junk food eaters like you are.""

Sherlock chuckles softly and nuzzles John. ""Makes sense. You are carrying a pup and or pups so it would be easier for you to handle things I like. Comforting at least."" He kisses John tenderly. ""I don't know how many. It's probably far too soon to make a distinction. I wonder if it will smell different? If you're carrying multiples.""

""Mmm. I wonder."" John says, then jumps when the toaster pops. He ignores Sherlock's laughter, quite used to the teasing by now. He couldn't help it if a toaster, of all things, made him jump. Even if he could perform a life saving surgery with explosives going off around him.

Slathering butter and honey on the toast he lets Sherlock fix their tea, then they take the food into the other room. He pours over the loose letters from his dad while he eats, then when he's done he lays back and calls Sherlock over.

""Come scent me, let's see if it helps me keep the toast down.""

Sherlock doesn't have to be told twice and he immediately goes, scenting John liberally.

I'm terrible at naming chapters. I wanted name this ""Letters in the walls, and a bun in the oven"" but that just felt long. Plus, the letter wasn't in the wall, was it? - Tindo


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

The back door opens, but John doesn't look up. They would have heard shouting (or worse) if it were a stranger. He inhales deeply, loving the excitement lingering in Sherlock's scent. But instead of just smelling his mate he smells something lemony.

Groaning, John rolls his head back and sees the upside-down shape of Mycroft Holmes standing in the doorway to his childhood living room.

""Well, if it isn't Uncle Mycroft,"" John says before realizing what he'd said.

Mycroft raises a brow and looks them over. ""I wasn't expecting a happy announcement quite so soon."" He hummed, knowing John didn't conceive after his last heat.

""What are you doing here, Uncle Mikey?"" Sherlock snorts, knowing Mycroft hates nicknames.

Mycroft rolls his eyes. ""I have information.""

""What is it?"" John asked, placing a hand on the nape of Sherlock's neck, letting him know he didn't want Sherlock to move.

Mycroft sighs and moves across the room to sit in the single armchair. Leaning his umbrella against the side of his chair, he folds his hands over one knee and leans forward.

""Sherlock has, for once, been keeping me updated with your findings. I was able to unearth the name of the man who was supposed to buy your mother.""

John sits up, dislodging Sherlock. He looks across the room to the man. In a cold voice, he simply asks ""Who?""

""A man by the name of Jacobs Moriarty. He dabbles in sales"" Mycroft says with distaste, letting John know that whatever it is Jacobs sold was just a front. ""Wealthy man, untouchable. He saw the advert your grandparents posted when your mother approached legal age and was the highest bidder.""

""Let me guess, he was pissed that my dad knocked her up, but having someone else's pup in the picture wasn't in his plan?""

""Quite so,"" Mycroft says with a nod.

Sherlock stills, remembering the name Moriarty from the cabbie. ""Is he local? Or has local contacts?"" He asks, wondering if there's a connection to the car bomb.

""Oxford,"" Mycroft says with a shake of his head. ""Though his business takes him all over the country, and abroad. I wouldn't put it past him to have connections as vastly spread out as I do.""

Tugging his shirt back down once again, John sits up and folds one leg under him. He realizes a moment later that his mum used to sit like this, and the thought made him smile briefly.

""So, this arse put a bid in on a 16-year-old girl. To do what exactly? Get her after her first heat, or was he at least going to wait until she was 18?""

""Unsure, Doctor Watson... John,"" Mycroft amends, ""They were still in the early stages of negotiation when your parents bonded.""

""Oh... about that,"" John says, quickly explaining the circumstances of his parent's bonding. Mycroft raises an eyebrow, and says ""Remarkable people, having remarkable children.""

""Hold on, is that a compliment?"" John says, looking from Mycroft to Sherlock.

Sherlock raises a brow and looks Mycroft over. ""Oh. Why?"" He frowns. ""You talked to Harry. For what reason?""

""After the incident with your car, I felt it prudent of me to check in on John's sister. We are unsure of the target. It could be John, or it could be his parent's research. Regardless, Harry is still involved, if only remotely.""

Mycroft sits back and gives John a careful look. ""I've removed her to a secure location. One that has no access to alcohol. It should be... beneficial.""

""Right, thanks..."" John says, instantly feeling guilty that he hadn't thought of his sister.

""Meanwhile, we need to know more about the physical changes a perfect match causes in the body. John, what are the chances you have had bloodwork done recently?""

John was taken aback by Mycroft asking for his records rather than just taking them. He assumed it had something to do with Sherlock being his Alpha, and Mycroft attempting to go through the proper channels.

""I had a full workup done before I enlisted, and after they sent me home. Sherlock will have to sign off on you getting copies, but you have my permission.""

Sherlock nods. ""Get the paperwork and I'll sign it."" He hums. ""And you have my blood work from.."" He sighs. ""From rehab.""

""Already acquired,"" Mycroft says, reaching into his breast pocket for a medical release form.

He passes it to John, who checks it over then hands it to Sherlock with a nod.

""I assume we should get a full blood panel done now that we're bonded. Hopefully, the baby won't skew the results too much."" John says, placing a hand over his stomach.

""If anything I'd think it would amplify the effect."" Sherlock hums as he signs the papers, annoyed he's the one having to sign and not John.

""Do you need us to go somewhere specific?"" John asks, ""I can draw the blood myself if you get me the kit.""

""I'll have it sent first thing tomorrow.""

""What are we looking for?"" John asks quietly as Sherlock settles on the sofa beside him.

""We aren't sure yet,"" Mycroft says uneasily and John got the feeling that Mycroft disliked not knowing more than Sherlock.

Sherlock thinks. ""Betas."" He says suddenly.

""Betas?"" John and Mycroft both say, turning to look at the lanky detective who was currently in the process of leaning forward to rub his face on John's stomach.

""Oi..."" John says with a huff of laughter. ""Think, love. The pup can wait two minutes for his dad to be brilliant.""

""Beta's before they have children they have health checks to make sure they have compatible blood types and such. So that the pup doesn't get anything passed down to them or the mother has ill effects with a second pregnancy."" Sherlock mumbles, rubbing his face against John's belly again. He can't help it. It's like he's being pulled. ""We're looking for comparability so why not look at the cellular level? If we're not biologically compatible it wouldn't work.""

""Makes sense,"" Johns says with a smile, his hand finding its way back to Sherlock's hair.

""Gives us something to start with, at least.""

""Whether or not the outcome is to have children is a moot point. We should also look at pheromones and scents. John likes my scent but Mycroft's is a turn-off. Why? We're related. It has to do with a biological component."" Sherlock mumbles, scenting John.

""Maybe, because your blood is similar enough that nature needed a way to guide me to you, not your brother?"" John says, honestly just guessing at this point. ""You're both Alphas, same parents... it wouldn't hurt to compare your blood as well, Mycroft.""

""I'll see to it,"" Mycroft says, watching his brother with soft eyes. ""While you look the part of a fool, Brother mine... you seem happy.""

""The happiest fool of all the seven seas."" Sherlock mumbles, nuzzling against John's belly. ""It's physically imperative I do this or else I can't think. Even less than I already am.""

""You should also look and see if there are samples of John's parents' DNA on file. We need a larger pool to sample from. We need to find others. Others with soulmate bonds. If we have any hope of figuring this out we need more data. We also need to look into folk and fairy tales. Especially those perpetuated by omegas. We need more omega input. They're the key. Omegas are the key."" He resists licking John's belly but only just. He's not sure if he's making any sense but that doesn't really matter to him since he can smell his pup.

""Is there a room I can use to make a few phone calls?"" Mycroft asks John, a bemused smile on his face.

""Yeah, my old room."" John directs him up the stairs then turns to his mate. ""This is going to be a problem, isn't it? We're going to be doing the bloody grocery shopping and all of a sudden my shirt's going to be lifted and your head pressed against my stomach. Still... I kept food down finally.""

""Mm, it'll get better. Maybe."" Sherlock mumbles and then laughs. ""Mycroft is going to be able to smell the sex we had on the bed.""

""Why do you think I sent him there, and not Harry's room?"" John laughs.

""So... Moriarty?"" He asks cautiously, knowing that word was a sore spot for Sherlock. It reminded him there were things even his vast intellect didn't know about.

Sherlock hums and nods. ""It keeps coming up. Now we know it's a real person. And real people can be dealt with.""

John closes his eyes and allows himself a moment to enjoy Sherlock's closeness and the newfound knowledge that he was carrying their pup. Less than three days old, it was already the most loved child John knew.

He listened to the sound of footsteps above. Mycroft pacing, just like Sherlock did when he was annoyed.

""I want to go back to the ocean,"" John says softly, looking down at Sherlock.

""Whenever anything happened, good or bad. I'd ride my bike there. This,"" he says, placing a hand on his stomach, ""is good, and I need to go.""

""Alright. I'll make us a thermos of tea and tell Mycroft. You'll need a thicker jumper. It's windy out."" Sherlock kisses John and slowly starts to peel himself away.

""I'm pregnant, Sherlock... not an old man who wears jumpers in the summer,"" John says, then looks down and grimaces. He is, in fact, wearing a jumper, and it's damn near summer out.

Sherlock opens his mouth in rebuttal but John points a finger at him and shakes his head once. ""No, nope. Not a word.""

""Mm fine."" Sherlock hums and finally gets up, deciding to pick his battles. He goes to tell Mycroft that they're going to the beach and Mycroft tells him to take agents. Sherlock rolls his eyes and goes down to make tea.

John picks up his mother's journal and tucks it under his arm, then retrieves his jacket. He takes it with him, while pointedly not putting it on. John had made it a point to go out of his way to disobey or ignore orders from an Alpha, and he wasn't going to start listening now just because Sherlock was outing himself as a nervous father.

They take one of the agents with them, John letting the man drive. (As driving with your Mate's head or hands constantly on your stomach would be unsafe.) He directs the man to a spot nearby, where they can be observed from a distance, allowing the agent to keep the car secure.

John picks his way across the rocks and finds one big enough to sit on. There's no sand here, but the rocks are smooth and worn from years in the sea.

""This was my spot,"" he said, staring out over the lapping water. ""I'd come here when I just needed to escape. Did you have a spot like that?""

Sherlock nods. ""The woods surrounding my grandmother's house. After Mycroft went to university I spent a lot of time with her there before I was sent to boarding school.""

""Nature..."" John nods. ""Calming, peaceful, yet alive.""

They sit for a while, the ocean waves calming John until the tension from the last few days subsided. Any time his stomach lurched, he'd pull Sherlock close and the pains would go away.

""Why do you think it's like this? The strange morning sickness? Is it because I'm supposed to be near you right now? A form of bonding, between the parents and the fetus? It isn't like this normally. An Omega's pregnancy is almost a spitting image of a Beta's. The same time frame of symptoms, gestation period... everything. The only thing that changes is fertility rate, it being higher in Omegas allowing for multiples more frequently.""

""I'm not sure. Our bond is still new as well. And I don't mean this as a derogatory thing but you are older than the average omega when they have their first pup. Maybe your body just needs to be sure I'm here. That we're in this together."" Sherlock holds John close, scenting him.

""Mmm, by now most omegas are having their last litter. And we're just getting started.""

John leans into Sherlock's warmth, enjoying being cared for.

He sits and reads his mother's journal a bit, but stops when he finds the entry describing Harry's birth. Saving it for when they were back at the house.

""We should think about heading back soon, and dinner. I don't think being out in the open like this is exactly smart, but I wanted to get some fresh air.""

""I'm sure Mycroft has this whole town crawling with agents. I've spotted at least four just sitting here."" Sherlock hums, there seems to be even more while they've been out. Maybe Uncle Mycroft had a soft spot for pups.

""We can go back whenever you like. And a light dinner. Don't want to overwhelm your stomach when you just started to calm down."" He sniffs John, seeing if there's any change. ""Oh, he couldn't smell it."" He says, realizing Mycroft couldn't smell John being pregnant.

""Alright,"" John says, settling back again and staring out over the water. They sit for ten more minutes until John is forced to admit (to himself) that Sherlock was right and the wind did have a bite to it.

Standing up he helps Sherlock to his feet then picks his way back over the rocks to the path leading back to the car. Once in the car he gets his mobile and places an order for two large pizzas for them to pick up. Hanging up he looks over to find Sherlock staring at him.

""I'm hungry,"" he says with a shrug. ""And I'm pregnant now so I can blame it on the pup.""

""Mm blame this on the pup too."" Sherlock hums and lifts John's jumper and sticks his head inside, face presses to John's belly. ""Mycroft couldn't smell it. It's faint but still, he would have picked up on it. He would have made a comment about your scent change. We're the only ones that can smell the pup. For now at least."" He kisses and licks John's belly.

""Make..."" John starts to say but begins laughing as Sherlock's tongue begins to tickle him. ""makes sense,"" he tries again ""when you bonded me, it locked my scent in for you only. They'll still be something that tells others I'm an Omega, but my unique scent is for you only now.""

John tries to fight Sherlock out of his shirt but it's no use. In the end, he's forced to accept that for now, Sherlock's face was a permanent fixture on his stomach.

Sherlock lets out a low happy growl at John's scent only being for him. Only he gets to smell John. He nuzzles and scents John's belly. He knows the pup would be microscopic at this point. Tiny tiny. So small. So fragile. He can't help but want to be close. To protect John.

Oh hello wrench, meet plot.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


When they arrived back at the house a man was standing next to his car talking to agents.



""That's him!"" John says excitedly, exiting the car the moment it stops. He leaves the pizzas on the seat for either Sherlock or Mycroft's minion to get and heads straight for the newcomer.



""Uncle!"" He cries happily, walking straight towards the man and wrapping his arms around his shoulders. They embrace quickly, then John turns to see Sherlock's holding the pizzas against his hip.



""Sherlock this is my dad's brother, Matt.""



John keeps his hand on his Uncle's arm. Though a beta the man's baseline scent is close to his father's and it reminds John of warm hugs and burying his face in his dad's chest. 
He looks at Sherlock and smiles, seeing his partner's eyes dart over his kin. Then his eyes crinkle and a small smile graces his lips as if John being happy made him happy.



Sherlock extends a hand, ""Sherlock Holmes,"" he says, introducing himself.



""Well, technically Holmes-Watson,"" John says, ""Still getting used to that. He's my Mate.""



Matt's eyes instinctively flick to John's neck then he nods once and shakes Sherlock's hand. 
John leads them into the kitchen, when Sherlock takes his coat off he hears his Uncle gasp and turns to see his uncle staring at Sherlock's neck.



""You..."" He says gently, looking from John to Sherlock, ""soulmates?""



""So you know."" Sherlock sets the pizza boxes on the table and gets some plates.



""How could I not? With my brother nose deep in it like he was."" he doesn't seem surprised when John and Sherlock nod.  Instead, he looks around the house and shrugs. ""I see why you came back, and why you called me. I'm sorry to say I don't know much. But,"" he looks over at John and gives him a warm smile, ""It is great to see you. Been following your blog. No one told me you went off and joined the army.""



""And got my doctorate."" John says, not unkindly, ""Mum made Harry promise.""



""Yeah, I remember that.""



John gestures to the table, then they all hear footsteps coming down the stairs, ""Apparently the queen could smell the food,"" he mutters to his mate who snorts before masking his mirth.



""Evening all. Nice to meet you, Mr. Watson. I'm Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother."" Mycroft introduces himself.



Sherlock opens the pizza boxes and gets John some slices on a plate, his instincts telling him to feed his mate first. 
John looks pointedly at Sherlock, then at the pizza. When Sherlock rolls his eyes (but grabs a slice for himself) John lets his face soften. He couldn't remember the last thing Sherlock had eaten, which meant it had been at least twenty-four hours since his last meal. While he appreciated Sherlock's focus, they'd already had to run for (presumably) their lives once. If they had to do so again, John wouldn't want to have to pick Sherlock up and carry him due to his mate passing out from low blood sugar.



Matt introduces himself to Mycroft, then looks out towards where his car sat in the driveway. Nodding his head, and accepting a plate from Sherlock, he asked, ""They coming in? Those two...""



""Agents,"" Mycroft says, filling in the blanks. ""They're currently on the clock. They'll eat when their shift is over.""



It takes them most of dinner to fill Matt in on everything that had happened since John had returned home. When they tell him about the incident with the car he lets out a low whistle and mentions he'd seen it on the news. John finishes by telling him about the research they'd found hidden away and shakes his head sadly.



""I never knew what they were looking into,"" John says, running a hand over his mothers journal.



""I did, to an extent. Used to watch you rugrats when they went off to chat with another couple. Remember all our movie nights?""



""You mean the nights you gave me cavities,"" John laughs gently. ""So they were off on research trips then?""



""Never could sit still those two. Even when things started getting dangerous. More than once the breaks on their car would fail, or warning notes would show up on their door. But they didn't stop... Even after Hank..."" Matt says, clearing his throat, ""Joann wouldn't give up. She knew there had to be something more to life, than forced bonds.""



""Do you remember any of the couples they talked to?"" Sherlock asks, eating under John's watchful eye.



Matt furrows his brow and scratches his index finger over his eyebrow. Sherlock notices the gesture and wonders if John's dad had exhibited the same tick, or if their children would pick up John's mannerisms.



""Not sure... There was a couple in Ulverston, name was something cook something..."" He shrugs, then drums the fingers of one hand on the table. ""Could chat with a couple my parents knew. Our parents were betas, but I remember both of their friends having bites. Things like that stick out to a kid who isn't used to seeing bond marks daily. They're in a care home not far from here.""



Matt gives John the name and address, then looks around at the half-empty house. ""It's a bit weird... seeing this place like this.""



""Yeah,"" John nods, ""I know.""



""I don't mean to be a damper but simply being here now involves Matthew. Whoever blew up the car will be watching him as well."" Mycroft hums as he finishes his slice of pizza.



John glares over at Mycroft but Matt just laughs it off.



""If you're worried you'll have to give up one of your government men to watch me, don't. Who do you think gave John the military bug? I can defend myself. And if anyone comes asking, I'll just tell them I wanted to visit my nephew and wish him well on his bonding. Still new?"" he asks, looking from John to Sherlock, then back to his nephew. ""You two keep going from moon eyes to glares.""



""New-ish."" John nods.



""New enough."" Sherlock agrees, picking up another slice of pizza when John gives him a look.



John finds himself tempted to tell his Uncle the other half of the news, but Mycroft's warning made him pause. He would tell his Uncle when it was safer. If word spread about his pregnancy it would make him a weaker target, and an easy way to gain access to Sherlock. They chatted for a while longer, both Watsons proving to Mycroft just how stubborn the Watson line was until Matt glanced at the clock and sighed.



""I should head home, the wife will be waiting. It was good to see you again, John. And wonderful to meet you, Sherlock."" He looks at Mycroft and purses his lips, then says, ""You're not half bad either. While it looks like you have a rose bush up your arse, you seem to genuinely care about these two.""



Mycroft makes a nose that is almost a stutter before masking his face and shaking Matt's hand. John walks him to the door, then gives him a final hug. ""Sorry I was a stranger. I'll do better.""



""Yeah well, it works both ways, I could have done better too,"" Matt says, then pats the pocket where his mobile is located. ""I'll stay in touch.""



John gets back to the table just in time to hear Mycroft mutter ""Watsons"" as he stands.



""Watsons indeed."" Sherlock chuckles softly.



""We're a stubborn lot,"" John says, walking up behind Sherlock and leaning over his sitting frame. He places his head on Sherlock's shoulder and nuzzles the side of his face. ""I warned him it might be dangerous before inviting him here. He'll be okay. He was a Royal Marine, can hold his own.""



Sherlock nuzzles John, eyes closing as he relaxes. ""Mycroft will just have to get used to it when he babysits."" He teases.



John snorts, imagining Mycroft reasoning with a toddler than was half Holmes and half Watson. ""There's no hope for him, is there?"" he asks with a laugh.



Having eaten his first full meal in days, his stomach is less than thrilled with him. But John has enough time to put the dishes in the sink before he needs Sherlock. ""Bedroom?"" he says softly, rubbing his stomach, ""bit of nuzzling while I read more of mum's journal?""



Sherlock nods and finishes putting the leftovers away before following John up. ""You're starting to look better. Not so pale.""



""Helps to have you scent me. I can keep food down."" John nods, closing the bedroom door. ""Whoever I'm growing in here is going to be a handful."" He sighs happily then sprawls out on his parent's bed, pulling Sherlock with him. ""Let's see what mum has to say about birthing soulmate pups, shall well?""



He reads the entry aloud, the doctor in him able to appreciate the attention to detail his mother gave the entry. When he's done, he closes his eyes and places the book on his chest, and watches Sherlock as his Alpha showers his stomach with kisses. ""So, dad bit her again, during both births. I wonder if it was instinctual, or if they'd planned it.. she doesn't say.""



""Did he help her give birth?"" Sherlock asks, nuzzling and kissing John's belly. He decides John's jumper is just in the way so he strips John's top half completely so he has unhindered access to John's belly.



""She sounds like a doctor, John. The way she wrote everything down, the monitoring, weighing, temperatures. Every day. It was her log. Her research documents. I.."" He scents John. ""When I was out in the garden shed I found medicinal plants. Things you'd find in an apothecary or holistic medicine."" He hums. ""Did you and Harry ever get sick as pups?""



""Mmm the occasional stomach bug here and there, and Harry brought home lice once,"" John says thinking back, letting his mate manhandle his clothing off of him. ""But that was it, mainly. Why you think she found a way to keep us healthy?"" he asks, turning back to the book and leafing through the pages. 
Sure enough, towards the back, the book went from a journal to a log. Hand-drawn sketches of plants with descriptions written below them of their uses. He lets out a low whistle then shakes his head. ""I barely knew them...""



""I think maybe she was worried to take you to a doctor. A doctor who works for the government."" Sherlock says softly, in some of John's mother's letters she seemed wary of people in official roles.



""We went to the local GP a few times,"" John muses, ""but mainly just for the shots, we needed for school. I always thought it was because they didn't approve of all the tests they ran on omega children.""



John reaches down and strokes a hand through Sherlock's hair. After a moment his fingers tighten and he pulls Sherlock up for a kiss. When Sherlock finally settled on his side on the other half of the bed John rolled over and faced him.



""So many secrets, and while we've learned so much, I feel like we haven't made any forward progress. What's next? Do we go visit the couple my uncle mentioned? Or do we start digging into Jacobs Moriarty?""



""We'll leave Moriarty to Mycroft for now. I doubt we'd be able to get anything on him ourselves at the moment. We'll see if he ever purchased another omega."" Sherlock cuddles John close.



""We could but we also have to be careful because we know we're being watched so anyone we come into contact with could also be in danger. Like I said before omegas are the key. We need to look for an omega group willing to part with information. If not to both of us to you at least."" He rubs his face to John's neck.



""So,"" John sighs, feeling a bit defeated and overwhelmed, ""We need to find a walk to talk to the omegas, without being seen talking with them. Meanwhile we're sitting here, where everyone can see us. I don't want to leave for a safe house, and that also doesn't feel like our best option. Not when there is leg work to be done. We need someone who isn't watching us, who can interview people for us. And, if we can swing it, I think a secure online forum where people can anonymously reach out might be nice. Someone out there knows something we don't....""



John sighs and rolls onto his other side, pressing his back against Sherlock's chest and pulling Sherlock's arm over his chest. It was still too early to tuck in for the night, but he needed this, needed the closeness. Plus, Sherlock seemed to do his best thinking while scenting him. ""We need an outside man or woman..."" he says softly.



Sherlock holds John close, kissing his neck and back as he scents him. ""Someone with access to omegas but isn't threatening. Someone who wouldn't raise suspicions. Who had access to channels.."" He mumbles as he thinks.



""Anyone, you know of in your brother's office?"" John thinks aloud, not wanting to get up and ask Mycroft himself. Not when Sherlock was busy nuzzling against him.



""Mm since Mycroft got shot he's always used Anthea for leg work."" Sherlock mumbles. ""Oh! Anthea! She's perfect! She's a beta and female! She can slip in and out no problem. She's Mycroft's right hand so she's trained to the teeth.""



""Wait,"" John says, turning halfway around to face Sherlock, ""He got shot?""



""Mmhmm. Few years ago. I was in rehab and I escaped after I got word he was shot. He had a total knee replacement and uses the umbrella as a cane. That's why he doesn't do leg work anymore. Anthea isn't his assistant. He's her handler."" Sherlock hums.



""Huh,"" John says settling back down against the mattress. ""Can't picture him doing fieldwork. But.. yeah Anthea would work. Should we go ask your brother?""



""Probably since he and Anthea have been sleeping together."" Sherlock hums.



John snorts. The thought of Mycroft in bed with anyone somehow feels like asking the Queen to vacuum. He sits up and reaches for his shirt and pulls it over his head, wishing he had packed a robe or more clothes.



""Do you think we should return to Baker Street soon? It can't be cheap for Mycroft to be here, or for him to have his agents watch us this far out. Heading home might also give whoever is watching us the false assumption that we've stopped digging.""



He doesn't want to leave. Despite his earlier fears that coming back to his childhood home would stir up too many memories, it had been pleasant to be here. Plus, there was the incident on his childhood bed to forever make the trip worth it. But still, the home was too vulnerable to attack, and away from London, they were away from the support of friends and police they trusted.



""Don't worry about the money. Protection is written into Mycroft's contract and it extends to family. We're going to be monitored regardless of danger or not. I know you don't want to leave this place. We can take whatever you want with us."" Sherlock says softly.



""London is our  home,"" John's says after a few minutes. ""These walls hold memories, but not ours. I want our bed, our flat, and sounds that are familiar. Once we're sure there's nothing else hidden here, let's head home."" He looks over at his mother's blanket and smiles, ""and yeah, I'll take a few things with us.""



""I'll talk to Mycroft and we'll make plans to go home."" Sherlock nods.



""Hey,"" John grabs Sherlock's arm as he starts to walk away and pulls him close, ""I love you.""



He nuzzles his Mate a minute longer than picks up his mother's journal. ""I'll be taking a bath and reading if you need me. I'd like a glass of wine but...I guess I'll have to come up with something else to drink for the next nine months.""



""I love you, too."" Sherlock nuzzles John and scents. ""Grape juice? Sparkling grape juice?"" He suggests.



""Mm, could work."" John rummages through his case for his pyjamas and heads off to the master bathroom while Sherlock talks with his brother.



Meanwhile, John skims through his mother's journal, smiling at the detail and effort she put into it. She must have worked on it after they'd gone to bed, he couldn't remember ever seeing her write. 
Sherlock knocks on John's old bedroom door, hearing Mycroft inside.



Mycroft gets up and goes to the door, his phone to his ear. ""Can I help you, baby brother?"" He muses.



Sherlock looks at him and rolls his eyes. ""We need Anthea. Tell her to be here in the morning. We need to discuss the next steps.



""Why do they need me, My?"" Anthea says to Mycroft over the phone. She was holding down the home office while Mycroft was making sure Sherlock was safe. Mycroft had trained her to succeed him one day and takes over when he needs her to. She rather likes being in charge, bossing all the alphas around. 
Sherlock quickly explains what he and John had just discussed and braces himself for pushback from his brother. Instead, he gets a single nod, then Mycroft is barking orders into the phone. 
Once done he hangs up and turns back to Sherlock.



""John is right, London is safer if he's refusing a safe house. We both have eyes and ears everywhere in the City. And, as he said, if we play our cards right we can delude people into thinking you've given up. If only for a short time.""



Sherlock nods. ""John's mother was meticulous. She kept exact notes in everything, Mycroft. Every feeling and inclination. Her instincts were spot on. She knew when John and Harry were going to get sick even before they started showing signs of an illness."" He sighs. They don't have enough data and it's driving him nuts.



""When Anthea comes in the morning have her bring a blood draw kit for John and me as well. We need to see the changes in both parties. I think we should start sniffing around the legitimacies of some of these so-called matchmaking services. If anything they're fronts for omega trafficking."" He says and rolls his eyes when he sees the look on Mycroft's face. ""Yes, I know this is how things are done but they're still trafficking people to the highest bidders. It's a human rights violation and I don't care if the law doesn't recognize omega's as their own people."" He growls.



""I have to get back to John before he starts feeling sick again. Enjoy your dirty phone calls with Anthea."" He turns to go back to John. He's so wrapped up in making sure John is alright it doesn't occur to him that it's not a good idea to have Anthea come to them if they were going to use her for undercover work. It's a good thing it occurs to Mycroft.



John hears the bathroom door open but doesn't lookup. He can tell by the way the air crackles that it's Sherlock and not Mycroft invading his space.



He hears a soft rustle and looks up, expecting to see Sherlock removing his clothing. Instead, he watched as Sherlock sits with his back against the tub. He rolls one sleeve up and slings an arm over the edge, his long hands resting on his leg.



""So much here... But the more I read the more I realized that Mum was more interested in the moment. She seems happy documenting our lives while all of dad's papers have a more frantic feel to them. Like he wanted answers, and wasn't content just riding the wave.""



""Well if you're anything like him, which I'm sure you are, his protection instincts would have been off the charts. He wanted to keep you and Harry and your mum safe."" Sherlock hums softly, his brain quieter now that he's back with John.



""Yeah..."" John says noncommittally. Placing the book on the edge of the tub he skinks down into the water until just his nose is sticking out. It's quieter in the water. He'd begin to get used to the constant hum of Sherlock in his mind but the last few days had been difficult for both of them.



And now, with the pup, his head felt like someone was trying to push his brain through his ears from the inside out. 
Lifting his head enough so his mouth and ears were briefly above water he says gently, hoping not to offended Sherlock,



""She found a way to quiet the constant chatter of the bond. It's not permanent. But they used it when they needed to focus, for work or something like that.""



Sherlock takes the book and sets it on the counter, knowing John would be upset if it fell into the bath. ""Tell me how to do it."" He says, knowing he must be driving John round the bed with his mind constantly on. 
John opened one eye and surveyed his Mate for a long moment.



""It's like my switch during my heat. You just... Focus on it, will it to shut off. Which makes me wonder if there's more. Can we send thoughts, or the feelings that accompany those thoughts? Can we just tone down the chatter without turning it off completely?""



John thinks back to the time he had Sherlock handcuffed in the bathroom and shrugs, sending the water sloshing. ""When I was trying to show you how I can manipulate Alphas during my heat, it didn't really work on you. I thought maybe it was because it wasn't a full heat. But what if... What if it's because I didn't really want to seduce you. I had no need, you were already displaying signs of submitting to me. There was no aggression to ward off.""



""That's very possible."" Sherlock hums and rests his head back against the edge of the tub as he focuses his thoughts and on his connection to John.



Slowly he divides the thoughts he wants to be available to John and all the other ones that don't need to be passed along. Soon the constant hum through their connection lessens by half as Sherlock's only sending what's necessary to John. 
He smirks a bit and decides to test it out to see if he can focus on a single thought to send directly to John. 'I love you'



A warm shiver rushes over John's body even as his mind quiets. He lifts his head and looks down to see he's covered in goose pimples from head to toe.



""What.. what was that?"" He says, looking over at the back of his mate's head.



Sherlock chuckles softly and turns to look at John. ""I focused on a message.""



""Mmm,"" John says with a crooked smile ""love you too. Also... Thanks. I can think a bit easier now.""



""I'm sorry. I know it can be overwhelming. I can't imagine what it's like from the outside."" Sherlock says softly.



""It's fine normally,"" John says waving Sherlock's worry off. ""Just right now, trying to piece together a puzzle that's all the same colour, it's a bit much. You must be sick of how dull my thoughts are."" He laughs softly.



""They're.."" Sherlock tries to think of a way to describe it. ""They're like how coming home feels.""



""Home is full?"" John teases, leaning over and pressing a wet kiss to Sherlock's head. ""Did it work both ways? Or do I need to do something on my end as well?""



""Not full. Content and safe."" Sherlock nuzzles him. ""I don't think you need to do anything. If you want me to hear something specific you can try focusing on it.



""Mmm. What about..."" John says, sinking back down into the water. He focuses on what it felt like to have Sherlock inside him. The stretch and the fullness of it. He can feel himself growing aroused as he focuses on the memory of their last coupling.



Sherlock gasps and arches a bit, his cock filling out quickly as John's thoughts flood his mind. He plays dirty, sending back how good it felt to be inside John and have his cock wrapped in John's tight wet hot slick body.



""Bedroom, now,"" John says, already rising out of the water. He triggers the drain with his toe and steps out, dripping water onto Sherlock from above. Neither of them seems to care, however. John reaches for a towel and gives himself a quick pat-down so he doesn't get the bed soaking wet. He pauses for a brief moment, as he leaves the master bathroom and looks at his parent's bed. It's a bit weird, having sex on their bed, but his need is great enough that he doesn't give it a second thought.



""Should we warn your brother?"" John giggles, as he pulls Sherlock down on top of him, ""or let him find out the fun way?""



""The door is closed. If he comes in any mental scars are on him."" Sherlock snorts and kisses John deeply, wrapping his omega's legs around him.



""Oh, I was more concerned with the noise I'm about to make,"" John says with a laugh while twisting his body and flipping their positions. He ends up with his knees on either side of Sherlock's thighs and his hands planted firmly on Sherlock's chest. ""I'm going to have you first, then once I'm good and turned on you can bend me over and make me scream your name.""



Sherlock's thoughts are flooded with how hot it is when John takes charge and manhandles him. ""Is that so? Going to take what you want from me, omega?"" He smirks, teasing.



""Damn right I'll take what I want,"" John says, reaching behind him to gather some of his slick to use as lube. ""How's it feel, knowing my Omega slick is going to help me fuck you?"" he asks in a gravelly voice.



John grabs the underside of Sherlock's knee with his clean hand and pushes Sherlock's legs back until Sherlock's arse is exposed. Ignoring Sherlock's cock completely, he slides his slick fingers over Sherlock's hole then pushes in. He wiggles his fingers, getting his slick everywhere before pulling his hand back to reach for more slick. ""Look how hard you are at the thought of being fucked by me.""



""Not my fault. You're just so sexy and hot and you turn me on so much."" Sherlock whines, holding his legs up and open. ""I want you to fuck me. Need it. Want you inside me. It feels so good to claim your alpha, doesn't it?"" He groans, his cock throbbing as he feels John spread slick over him.



""So good."" John purrs, sliding the tip of his cock over Sherlock's hole, though he doesn't push in. Not yet. He knows Sherlock enjoys this just as much as he does, and wants to draw it out until his mate is begging for it.



""Tell me, Alpha,"" he growls, pushing his cock against Sherlock's hole with just enough pressure to remind Sherlock of what was about to come. ""Is it better with my slick? Dirtier knowing it's my body, out of heat, aiding me in fucking you? Tell me, or I won't push in, I'll just torment you like this.""



""Yes yes. Your slick is so good. So delicious. I want to taste every drip. Love it when you fuck me with it, feel your cock slid in and out of me which your slick coating me."" Sherlock whines a bit, trying to press down more against John's cock to get him inside.



John grabs both of Sherlock's legs and pulls them together. He guides Sherlock's legs to both sit on his right shoulder, then with a single push enters Sherlock. He knows how much his mate loves this. How he loves minimal preparation, and the feeling of John taking him in one push. Still, John holds himself still until Sherlock's breathing grows less frantic. When Sherlock wiggles once against him, he knows he's ready.



""So good for me,"" John purrs, not caring one bit about the volume of their voices. Mycroft can either sod off to the car for half an hour or ignore them. ""Look at you, getting fucked by your pregnant mate. If other Alphas found out..."" he growls while snapping his hips forward. He wraps both his arms around Sherlock's legs, holding them flush to his chest, and uses them for leverage. ""So god damn sexy...""



Sherlock presses a hand back against the headboard as the other grasps at the sheets. ""Oh fuck, John!"" He moans, head thrown back as his omega takes him.



""If they knew how fucking good it felt they drop trow and bend over. Oh fuck yes. There!"" He moans, maybe a bit louder than necessary to annoy Mycroft but John did feel so good and he wasn't going to hold back. He loves how John's cock fills him, as far as male omega cocks go John had a pretty sizable one but Sherlock loved how thick it was. He may be a bit of a size queen but he never knew it until he took John's cock.



""Oh? Pretty boy Alpha likes his prostate milked?"" John says slyly, pulling out then pressing in with a slow slide, relishing the way Sherlock's legs tightened on his shoulder as his cock milked every last drop of pleasure from Sherlock's body.



""John John John John!"" Sherlock's thighs trembling a bit. He loves this. Loves how John can take him apart so easily. He loves John so much he can't even think. ""Yours. I'm yours. Anything you want. Yours.""



John fucks Sherlock with a slow and steady pace. Enough to bring them both to the edge without tipping either of them over it. He watches as Sherlock's cock, trapped between his thighs, begins to leak until there is a pool of pre-come on Sherlock's stomach. When John feels as if he can't hold off his orgasm any longer he pulls out with a wet pop and releases Sherlock's legs.



""Fuck me and make me come, Alpha,"" he demands while flipping over onto his hands and knees. He yelps a bit as Sherlock grabs his hips and flips him onto his back, but purrs happily as Sherlock nuzzles along his neck. This is better, facing each other. He loves the way Sherlock watches him when they're like this.



Sherlock holds John close, nuzzling and kissing over John's bite as he presses his cock into John. He nibbles and sucks on it teasingly as he rolls his hips, letting the desire for one another build.



""You like fucking me, don't you? Feeling like you have the power. That you're in charge. Pushing your omega cock in your alpha. Making me squirm and be for more."" He teasingly snaps his hips. ""But you're mine. All mine. To do with as I please. You do the same to me."" He presses deeper.



""All mine,"" John growls back, reaching a hand down and grabbing a fistful of Sherlock's arse. He wishes his reach was a bit longer so he could stick a finger inside Sherlock, but Sherlock's torso is longer than his, and his arse hole is just out of reach. So he settles for leaving bruises with his fingertips along his mate's hips and cheeks. ""I could flip you over right now and finish this, with my cock buried deep inside you. And you wouldn't stop me, you love it too much.""



""Mm, I'll fill you first, and then you can go back to fucking me however you like while my come leaks out of you."" Sherlock nips at John's lips as he rolls his hips, rubbing John's prostate endlessly.



John closes his eyes and lets his Alpha give into his natural instincts. He loves their power play, loves seeing his cock inside his Alpha, but most of all he loves this. Loves Sherlock taking care of him, even while pretending to be big and tough. John tilts his neck, presenting his bite. But as time passes, and he can feel both of their climax approaching, and Sherlock doesn't bite him, John lets out a frustrated groan.



Taking Sherlock's head in both hands he forces Sherlock's neck to the side while pulling him close to his mouth. His teeth sink into Sherlock's scent gland, he can feel his teeth filling the same indents and it's like sinking your fingers into memory foam. There's no blood or fluid, just... emotion and want. He can feel Sherlock's core like this, the things that make his Alpha tick. It's like looking at the inside of a clock and seeing the gears move, but not knowing what role each notch plays.



It's all he needs. His shout is muffled by Sherlock's neck, but he doesn't dare release his Alpha. Somehow, this feels right, to be connected like this to the man who'd impregnated him outside of a heat. His fingers dig into Sherlock's neck, and he realizes they must hurt but Sherlock doesn't pull away, and there's no discomfort coming across their bond. Thrusting his hips up once, allowing his cock to slide across Sherlock's stomach, he comes hard, and only releases Sherlock's neck when he fears his tremors might cause his teeth to rip flesh.



Sherlock can't help it. As soon as he feels John bite him he's coming and filling his omega. All thoughts leave his head, leaving him blank and everything quiet. There's only two things he can register, one being John's teeth on his skin and his cock pumping cum into John's body.



""Ahh so good,"" John purrs, licking Sherlock's neck as his Alpha fills him. ""So good, love.""



He holds Sherlock close, until their bodies stop shaking, then presses kisses along Sherlock's jawline.



""Every time we do this, I feel closer to you. I don't mean sex... I mean... biting,"" he says softly while running his fingers through the hair at the nape of Sherlock's head.



Sherlock nuzzles and kisses John's chest, his brain trying to remember words and how to speak without much luck so he just holds John close as he presses kisses to his skin.



Eventually, he can remember how talking works. ""You're perfect."" He mumbles softly.



""So are you,"" John says, reaching for the towel he'd (thankfully) brought with him. He cleans them both off then snuggles close. ""I wasn't too rough?"" he asks, knowing that Sherlock's body (like a male Beta) didn't take a cock quite as easily as his did. He always asked, wanting to make sure that his mate was okay with their power struggle.



""No. You were perfect. Your cock was perfect. You fucking me was perfect."" Sherlock curls up around John's belly, scenting and nuzzling it.



""Mmm good,"" John says happily, enjoying Sherlock's aftercare. ""I love being called your omega during sex."" He admits, letting his fingers dance across Sherlock's head. ""It's worth being an Omega if I get to be yours.""



""I'll make sure to call you my omega during sex then."" Sherlock presses kisses to John's belly. ""I don't know how your dad got anything done when your mum was pregnant. I can't even consider you being out of my line of sight let alone working or any other separate activity.""



""Excuses, excuses,"" John purrs, though he laughs as Sherlock nuzzles his head down into his stomach. ""Oi, don't squash the baby... He's still cooking in there.""



""At this point it's microscopic and it'll be cooking for quite some time,"" Sherlock mumbles against John's skin.



""Mmm,"" John says sleepily. ""Too early for bed?"" he asks, not knowing the actual time. It had to be close to eight, if not a little after. Early, by their standards, but his eyes were tired from reading all day.



""No. Your body is creating a person from basically nothing. Sleep is good."" Sherlock pulls the covers up around him. He lays behind John and presses against John's back, his hand resting protectively over his belly.



As he drifts off, John is hit by the fact that he's carrying a pup. Not just any pup, but their pup. He snuggles back against his mate and tries not to worry about how much baby-proofing Baker Street needs, or over the fact that they hardly had space for a crib or playpen in the living room. They'd make it work, he knew that, still, it was daunting to think about all the work they'd need to do before the baby was born. Worse yet, knowing that their preparations would be nothing compared to the actual work of raising a human being.



""Hush, everything will be fine."" Sherlock soothes, kissing John's head and sending calming feelings through their connection.



""Out of my head,"" John says weakly, though he doesn't mean it. Sherlock chuckles and the waves of calming energy he sends allows John to clear his mind and drift off.


These two just want to have sex non stop. How dare they, we have a story to tell here! -Tindo


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


Anthea looks up from the computer as Mycroft comes in, she had been alerted he left John's family home and had been waiting for him to show up ever since. ""Didn't expect you till the morning."" She hums.



""They were loudly expressing their mutual desire for physical gratification,"" Mycroft sighs, pulling his tie off and sinking into an armchair in Anthea's hotel room. ""Thin walls.""



""Shall I get you a drink to numb the pain?"" Anthea laughs softly, finishing off a report before sending it and closing her laptop.



""There is another way to banish the echoes of their... desire,"" Mycroft says, looking up with a single eyebrow raised. ""If you're willing.""



""With you? I'm pretty much always willing."" Anthea gets up and walks over to him, hips swaying. ""Here or in bed?""



""Anywhere you'd like, Sir"" rings in Mycroft's head, her first words to him when they'd first entered into this little arrangement. ""What do you want,"" he asks softly. His brother's constant worry for pleasing John had gotten into his head, and for once he wanted Anthea to have whatever it was she wanted.



""Oh don't you dare go and get soft one me now,"" Anthea smirks and straddles Mycroft's lap, her skirt riding up her thighs. ""I want you. And you're so good at giving me what I want."" She noses along his jaw.



Mycroft eyes her for a moment then gives a single nod. He stands, wrapping his arms around her back and taking her with him. He knew her, and her tastes. She'd want it rough and fast. He walks to the bed then drops her unceremoniously onto the mattress.



""Strip,"" he says, pulling off his already loose tie and tossing it onto the bed beside her, ""then cover your eyes with that.""



He leaves his clothes on, only undoing his belt and opening his zip. His cock grows hard, watching her scramble to take her clothes off. When she reaches for her nylons he stops her with a growl. ""Leave them,"" he says, then hums appreciatively when she doesn't question it. When she lays before him, his tie over her eyes dressed only in her panties and nylons, he grabs her legs and pulls her to the edge of the bed. 
Grabbing the sheer fabric between her legs he yanks, filling the room with a tearing sound. He knows he'll have to buy her a new pair, but the cost is worth it when he sees her shudder. Slipping aside her panties he lines himself up and slips into her warmth with a growl.



Anthea moans, her body arched off the bed as she takes every hard inch of him. She loved when he took her like this, loving how in control he was. How he knew exactly how to give her what she wanted. She knew it was like a game for him, playing with her body to see what made her shake and shiver.



""So hard for me."" She purrs, feeling him stretch her deep.



""Quite,"" He hisses, ""Or I'll rip your panties off and stuff them in your mouth.""



He sees her smirk, and wonders just how long it will be until she tests that claim.



Anthea licks her lips and instead of talking, she squeezes around his cock, massaging him from the inside.



Mycroft played Anthea like Sherlock could play his violin. It never ceased to amaze him how slick her entrance was for him every time. They'd never required lube, save for the one time he'd tried letting her top and she just wasn't having it.



When they both collapsed and spent, he indulged in a few moments of cuddling, understanding why his brother had embraced the seemingly pointless act with open arms.



""Thank you... I assure you that was not the reason I called you up here.""



""Oh? Well maybe that was the reason why I came."" Anthea teases, a little giggle passing her lips as she enjoys the cuddling. She rubs her fingertips over his arm, memorizing his freckles. ""Besides, we both know you think better after you fuck me through the mattress. Or over your desk. Or that one time when the elevator cameras weren't working."" She smirks.



They had been working together for ages. Mycroft handpicked her out of training because she was the most skilled of her class as well as the most trainable. She'd been his assistant at the start, his point of contact when he was out on missions. After he got shot she was the first at the hospital before he was even out of surgery and she stayed until he was discharged. She was the one who took him to rehab and even slept on his couch until he was able to manage by himself. She may be submissive towards him during sex because they both like it but that doesn't mean she's not a highly trained cold-blooded killer like he is.



""Right... To business then."" Mycroft says. The sweat on his skin and the cool air cause goose pimples on his skin.



Still letting Anthea trace shapes on his skin he lays out his needs then turns to her.



""Fieldwork... If you're willing. Step up from desk work.""



""Ooo letting me off my leash?"" Anthea smirks, her chin resting on his chin as she looks up at him.



""If a leash is what you've been on, then yes,"" Mycroft says, observing her with a keen eye. ""If you find it to your liking, we can discuss future missions, though I would be lost without you in the office.""



""Of course I'm willing. I'll look into groups and see where I can slip in. Being a beta has its advantages.""



She rubs her cheek against Mycroft's chest but stops herself. She knows if she enjoys this too much she'll give everything away. ""I'll do some undercover and recon. And I'll personally sweep the flat before they go back."" She says softly, knowing Mycroft feels better when she double checks everything the lackeys do.



""Mmm, and assign a team to create a secure website. We need a chat room, of sorts where people like my brother and relay information to us. As much as it pains me to say this, I don't even want to know who they are. If we know, there is a chance we could risk their safety. If you must create a database of names and addresses, encrypt it, and break the information up across multiple servers. Meanwhile, I need to return to London and look into Moriarty. Something tells me we're about to start hearing that name frequently.""



Mycroft sits up and reaches for the phone that will connect them with the front desk. He orders room service for both of them, then settles back against the bed to wait. ""No one followed you here?"" He asks, even though he already knows the answer. Still, he figures it wouldn't be unkind to show a bit of compassion.



""I'll have the Quartermasters start setting it up. We'll have to have some kind of verification to make sure they're legitimate. A questionnaire or something."" Anthea hums, biting the inside of her cheek.



""Of course I wasn't. But my flat is being watched which I don't appreciate."" She rolls her eyes. ""What I can't figure out is why is a Russian hitman sitting down the street from my flat drinking espresso and trying to tap my phones."" She says sarcastically and snorts.



""Espresso is far superior to a normal brew... and I hear your phone calls can be quite steamy"" Mycroft says smugly and smiles as her giggles vibrate across his chest. In a more serious tone, he sighs, and brushes a strand of hair out of her eyes, ""I'm afraid my brother unwittingly stumbled upon something quite dangerous. I overheard them talking, John's father was murdered, most likely over this.""



""Mm, next time I'll add you to the line to listen in."" Anthea teases. 
She frowns and nods. ""I'll see if there's an autopsy or anything on his father or any other documentation. Moriarty.. that sounds familiar. I can't remember why."" She gets up, walking over to her laptop naked and if she felt Mycroft's cum leaking between her legs she didn't seem to mind.



""Any information would be helpful. I don't want to tell John I'm looking into things. Not sure if he'd take it well, but perhaps if we find something, I can lead Sherlock in the right direction.""



Mycroft runs his hair through his hair and grimaces. He estimates they have seventeen minutes before room service arrives. With Anthea on the hunt once more, he has time for a shower. ""Call if you need me,"" he says, heading towards the bathroom.



Anthea joins him five minutes later. ""Jacob Moriarty was investigated some twenty years ago for a string of his omega's dying under mysterious circumstances. But since they were under his responsibility he denied autopsies and buried them in unmarked graves on his estate. We can't get an aerial view of the estate because there's interference going out to a five-kilometer radius around the parameter and above in the sky.""



""He was negotiating a contract to buy John's mother before she presented."" Mycroft muses, relaxing as Anthea snakes her arms around his waist. ""I've already looked, there aren't any copies of the documents, save one. The one where he forfeited his right to her as long as the parents returned the deposit, which they did not do. Though he never went after them.""



Wiping water from his face he turns and cocks his head at the petite woman sharing his shower with him. ""That doesn't seem likely for a businessman, does it? Leaving unclaimed money lying about?""



Anthea frowns and shakes her head. ""It doesn't. But all businessmen know how to get their payment. Maybe he got what he wanted without getting his money back..""



""Unlikely, but a possibility,"" Mycroft muses, ""Worth looking into at least. I have a theory, but it is too early in the game to extrapolate...""



Mycroft steps out of the shower, leaving Anthea to wash up. Toweling off he puts on his pants, trousers, and undershirt, then heads to the door. He opens it just as the waitstaff is reaching up to knock. Tipping the man, he accepts the food and places it on a small table.



""I'll return to London the day after tomorrow,"" he says loud enough for Anthea to hear, but not loud enough to be overheard should anyone be lingering in the hallway. ""Sherlock and his growing family aren't safe until this is resolved.""



Anthea comes out, drying off her hair. ""I'll never get used to how much you cum. It's like buckets."" She hums, pulling on a bra and panty set. ""Had to use the detachable shower head for almost five minutes to rinse it all out."" She nearly purrs but holds it back.



""I'll head out in the morning and make preparations. I.."" She stops thinking. ""I think we've been looking at this the wrong way.""



Mycroft's face begins to turn red at her comment, but as she continues he gives her a puzzled look.



""What do you mean?""



""If we think John's father was murdered then he's probably not the first nor the last. We have to look into alphas who died suddenly or under mysterious circumstances leaving an omega behind. It makes them vulnerable and targets. I'll get a report together and see if anything pops."" Anthea hums and comes over to the cart. ""What did you get?""



""You only nuzzle my face when you're craving something sweet,"" Mycroft says, lifting the cover off the tray, revealing a tray full of Petit Four.



""You know when you're good to me it makes me want to suck you off."" Anthea grins, licking her lips as she looks at her treat.



""Perhaps that was my motivation,"" Mycroft says with a wink, pinching a sweet from the tray.



""Mm, you should have gotten a can of whipped cream sent up as well. I would have licked it off."" Anthea smirks and takes her plate to the table.



""Lick? Mycroft asks warily, ""You mean bite. Or do you think I've forgotten the last time we tried?""



""You like when I nibble. Just not your cock."" Anthea laughs and eats.


Tindo here, trying to write a Mycroft we don't hate. So far so good.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          



His feet pound across hard dirt. Everywhere around him shadows seem to jump at him. The forest is dense. Damp earth and decaying leaves permeate his senses. He can hear them now, not just sense them. Footsteps behind him. Two, maybe three sets of feet crashing through the trees behind him. Not at all far behind. They'll catch up soon if he doesn't find a way out of here. He doesn't dare turn around, afraid that he'll stumble on a branch or root in the dark.





He runs, thinking of his children, his wife. Knowing they're waiting for him back home. They're probably sitting down for dinner even now, asking where Dad is. Their essence gives him a burst of speed and he flies through the forest as quick as his feet can safely take him.





He breaks free of the trees, and finds himself on a road, and nearly runs into his car which is parked just where he left it. Fishing his keys from his pocket he fumbles and nearly drops them. But even as the feet grow closer, he wrenches the door open and slides in, locking himself safely inside the car. He doesn't pause to see the faces of his pursuers. Who they are doesn't matter, just who sent them. And he already knows that. With shaking fingers he pushes the key into the ignition and turns it. The car roars to life, and an instant later a searing heat envelopes him. As the car burns, with him inside, he sees the faces of his children and prays that they'll be safe.




A scream tears its way from John's throat as he sits up. It takes him a moment to piece together where he is through the panic and tears in his eyes. A gentle hand presses itself against John's back as he begins to sob. He sits there, shaking, eyes burning with the image of his father's car blowing to pieces with him still inside it. While the logical side of his brain knows, regardless of method, his father died in hospital, it was still terrifying to see in such crystal clear imagery.



""It's alright, John. Just breathe. I'm right here."" Sherlock rubs his back gently and sends soothing calmness over their connection.



Gasping in huge gulps of air John curls into Sherlock, pressing his face into Sherlock's chest. In a broken voice, he explains the dream. By the time he's done his fingers are digging into Sherlock's shoulder in a way that must be painful, but his Alpha just holds him close. ""It, god it was so real. I could smell the accelerant used to feed the explosion.""



""I'm so sorry, John."" Sherlock kisses his head and holds him tight, scenting his mate heavily.



""Sherlock... make love to me,"" John says weakly, wanting to feel anything other than the wrung-out emotions his dream had left him with. ""Bite me, love me, make me feel better? Please?""



Sherlock nods and kisses John, rolling him onto his back. He teases John, getting him slick before he slides into his mate's body. He holds him close and rocks his hips deep and slow. ""You're here. You're safe. Our pup is safe. I'll keep you safe. I promise."" He rocks, licking and sucking on their bond mark.



For the first time, John lays still, leaving Sherlock to wipe away all traces of his nightmare. His mate showers him with kisses. On his neck, his jaw, his lips, even nibbling his ear a few times making John shudder. This closeness is what John needed, and Sherlock gives it to him willingly. It's slow, and perfect. John's hands ghost over Sherlock's back, and when Sherlock's teeth sink into his neck he sighs and comes in tiny droplets of come that drip from his cock onto his stomach. It's a far cry from their normal coupling, but as Sherlock rocks one last time into him, John kisses Sherlock's ear and whispers, ""Thank you.""



""Anything for you."" Sherlock holds him close, not moving away or pulling out.



""Not sure I can sleep,"" John says, turning his head to look at the clock, which read three am. ""Will I keep you up if I turn a light on and read?""



""You know I don't sleep much anyway."" Sherlock nuzzles his neck, licking the bite.



""Good, you can stay up with the pup when he wakes up at 2 am."" John says, trying to smile, but he's too shaken to put much effort into it.



""I'll take it."" Sherlock kisses John softly. ""We can make a nest and have some snacks and watch a movie?""



""How about... we make a nest and you tell me your hopes for our child?"" John says instead, ""Or tell me about your childhood. Something soft and sweet.""



""Alright."" Sherlock smiles softly. ""I'll get some blankets and pillows from the cabinet. Then I can tell you about grandmama and how we'd sneak away from parties to eat ice cream in the village.""



John nods and shifts on the bed to make room for additional bedding. When Sherlock comes back he helps his mate create a nest, then curls up with his back pressed against the wall of blankets. With a hand over his stomach, as if protecting the pup from unseen forces, he waits for Sherlock to settle in beside him. Their knees touch and John reaches out and takes Sherlock's hand, pressing it against his stomach and holding it there.



""It isn't just us now. I've been happy to rush into dangerous situations, blind to what might happen to me. But I can't do that anymore, can I?""



""No. Not anymore. Neither of us can."" Sherlock rubs John's hip. ""We have adult responsibilities now."" He teases gently.



They talk and cuddle in their nest until Sherlock's voice soothes John back to sleep. His dreams are less intense but drift from uneasy to forgettable.



Sherlock stays awake, scenting John and keeps John's bad dreams away as much as he can. He rubs John's belly gently, needing some kind of connection to their pup. He keeps his racing thoughts to himself so as not to disturb John. He has multiple theories running through his head but he needs more data to make a solid story. 


Short chapter is short. It was just a good place to break up the big block of text we have. Sometimes they pan out to be longer chapters, others end up short like this guy.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

When they finally leave John's parents' house they pack all the notes and books and everything from the house they may need or don't want to leave behind. They're driven by one of Mycroft's minions at first to Sherlock's annoyance but then it gives him more time to cuddle John and rub his belly.

When they arrive back at Baker Street he notices things have been moved and touched, no doubt the flat and whole building having been swept through multiple times by Mycroft's agents if not Mycroft himself.

Sherlock helps John organize all their findings. He starts to make a timeline of events through John's parent's letters and notes, thankful for John's mother's meticulous note keeping and journals. He likes reading about what John was like when he was younger and how he changed as he grew from a pup to a toddler to a small child.

He ignores Lestrade's calls for cases as they already have a case and they're supposed to be keeping a low profile. He and John argue whether or not they should take a case because they're supposed to be looking like they've given up on the whole soulmate case.

Sherlock caves rather quickly, not wanting to see his omega upset, and decides to take a small case just to make a show of being out as if they've given up on what happened at John's house.

Meanwhile, Anthea works tirelessly to get the secure omega site open and completely encrypted. She works closely with some other colleagues as well as interviews as many omega's and omega groups as she can.

Three days after Sherlock and John have come home to Baker Street Anthea has thick files of data for them to go through. She also has autopsy reports of every mysterious, sudden, or unexplained alpha death that left a widowed omega going back before John and Sherlock were even born.

John stands staring at the wall behind the sofa. He has one hand in his hair and the other on his stomach, absently rubbing small circles through his shirt. Sherlock is hunched over a laptop, he thinks.

Something has been bothering John but until now he hadn't been able to put a finger on it. But with the timeline completely he can see it now.

""Moriarty. That word, or name, keeps popping up. It's safe to assume it's a name, as there's always the initial J before it, like Jacobs Moriarty.""

He turns to make sure Sherlock is listening.

""What if it's a family of J Moriarty. It can't be the same person. This stretches back years before us. But how does that help? What is this, a sick and twisted family business? *Saving* Omegas after their mates die?""

""Maybe Jacobshad a child with one of his omega's and passed down the family business."" Sherlock hums.

""Forced breeding... Then take the child from the omega more likely."" John growls deep in his chest.

Sherlock gets up and goes to John, pressing against his back. ""It's alright. We'll solve this so no one has to endure it again.""

""Mmm,"" John says leaning back against his mate. ""Before I start showing would be nice... Can't imagine chasing after you once my center of gravity shifts""

""I would like to have everything settled and wrapped up before you give birth. Court and sentencing include."" Sherlock scents John, resting his hand on his belly.

""How long can I go before you push me into making my first appointment?""

""Considering I've already made one for you for tomorrow afternoon at a private secure clinic I'd say a little over twenty-seven hours."" Sherlock kisses John's neck, he had noticed John's scent changing again and it concerned him.

""Mmm, I'm busy tomorrow."" John wrinkles his nose but there's no real heat in his words.

He looks at the timeline and groans. ""All I see is a line of omegas losing their mates, then half of them, the younger ones, go missing before they have a chance to get over their grieving period.""

""Don't worry. I know a good detective to track you down."" Sherlock chuckles softly.

He hums softly, his mind turning over John's words. ""Grieving period.. grieving period... Grieving period!"" He says suddenly, going back to a stack of papers.

""What?"" John asks, watching Sherlock search frantically through the mess. ""What did I miss?""

""Paperwork. It's always the bloody paperwork."" Sherlock finds a pattern. ""From the time an alpha does until the omega because the responsibility of the closest related alpha is three days. It takes time for the paperwork to get processed after the death and the legal requirements to transfer to the closest alpha. All the omega's go missing within those three days. Those three days when the omega's are completely alone and unprotected legally and probably otherwise as well.""

""What does this mean, Sherlock?"" John gets an uneasy feeling in his gut as he watches his mate. ""So they're kidnapped? They don't just... Go off and kill themselves from grief?""

Sherlock shakes his. ""No. No, I don't think so. And since they're not allowed to be basically anything without an alpha's approval they couldn't do anything for themselves. I think they were taken..""

""Are we looking at two cases here? Or... is this all connected?""

John sits and runs a hand through his hair. It wasn't unheard of for Omegas to go missing, but there was an unspoken rule that after an Alpha passed, they would be given a short time to grieve while the government worked out who's family would take over legal rights.

""Is Moriarty involved in any of those Omega's lives, before they bonded? Are they soulmates? I'm so sick of finding more questions than answers.""

""I.."" Sherlock thinks. He's careful of what he tells John, knowing John is already stressed and doesn't want that to hurt his mate or their pup.

""Out with it,"" John says, getting up and heading into their kitchen. ""I know that look, and you think better talking out loud. I'll make tea. There's almost nothing tea can't cure.""

""I think there's an underground omega trafficking ring that gets their supply of omega's from killing their alpha and then kidnapping the omega to sell to the highest bidder."" Sherlock frowns.

""But why go through all the trouble?"" John starts to say. But as he places the teabags, decaf for him, into a cup he starts to understand, ""Because no one will go looking for them. Not under those circumstances...""

""Exactly unless the family really wanted to maintain control over the omega then they would be taken right away into the next alphas custody."" Sherlock frowns.

""What were the cabbies' words, before he died? His exact wording... He said he had a sponsor?"" John asks, bringing Sherlock his tea and settling into his chair, his mother's blanket now draped over the back replacing the old afghan. ""So, like a AA sponsor? Someone who... what? Encouraged him to murder? Then he dropped Moriarty's name. Murder isn't a far cry from trafficking."" John blows on his tea then takes a sip, mulling over the idea in his head. ""We need to find out more about this Jacobs Moriarty.""

""Maybe he helped murder the alphas and then drove the omega's to wherever they needed to go."" Sherlock hums.

John watched Sherlock work until the sun had long set. He ate dinner alone, though he managed to coax Sherlock into a few bites while Sherlock laid on the couch, his head nuzzling John's stomach, helping ward off the queasy feeling John still got when he ate. When he couldn't keep his eyes open any longer, he kissed the back of Sherlock's head and padded off to the bedroom. Sherlock joined him sometime after 1am, and wrapped his arms around John's back, muttering about Moriarty and how he must have another man who could grab the Omegas unseen.

He managed to get himself so absorbed in the book that he could finally stop thinking about him. He was halfway through the book when his perfect evening was interrupted by someone knocking on his door.

His first thought out of habit was the new case. But there were no cases anymore. He'd stopped taking cases from the police since the event of the rift. Not when there was no more Sherlock Holmes to work for. And now his thought circled back to him again. Great.

He was about to ignore them and pretend no one home if not for the person's annoyingly insistent knocking. He got up from the couch and went to the door with a groan.  

John was not prepared when Sherlock's older daughter was staring at him at the door. He hadn't seen her for the entire month after the rift. After that dinner.

""What do you want from us?"" She demanded from the doorstep. John frowned, confused.

""You've just knocked on my door and asked me what I want. I think that's my line.""

""I went to pay my rent today and Mrs. Hudson said it was already paid. I can't think of anyone else. So tell me, what do you want in return?""

John sighed and stepped aside, opening his door for her. ""Come in.""

He led her deep into the house, to the living room, and motioned her to sit on the armchair. He went about and came back to put some wood in the fireplace. The crackling sound felt satisfying to his ear. He set himself comfortably on the couch again. All the while he could feel the girl's eyes on him the whole time.

""Watson!"" Bea finally spoke. ""What do you want from us?""

""Do I look like someone who needs your help now?""

""But you paid for our rent."" She suddenly seemed uncertain. ""You paid our rent, didn't you?""   

""Yes. But I don't want anything from you.""

""Then why?""

John shrugged. ""You deserve it.""

When Bea just stared at him with a skeptical look in her eyes John sighed. ""Look, I know I've not been... treating you very well. But you knew there were urgent matters happening at the time so we didn't actually have time to... talk.""

""So you want to talk?""

""Only if you want to.""

""About what?""

""Anything.""

She was silent for a while. John was waiting for her to speak. The crackling sound from the fireplace was absolutely soothing.

""Can I ask you something about him then?"" Bea said carefully. John took a deep breath. But after everything, she definitely deserved it. So he nodded.

""For all those years, did he ever mention...?"" She swallowed and licked her lip, clearly anxious about the topic. ""When you first recruited us... Did he know?""

""Did you actually think he would care?"" The power the question held hung heavily in the air after he'd said it. It weighed down both of their heart. John knew from the look in Bea's eyes that the girl was hurt by the sheer fact. And John regretted saying it instantly. Regretted causing her more pain after all they had been through.

John wouldn't blame him. Sherlock was deep in his own misery to be able to care for anyone, not even himself. He knew of the utter incapacity of himself to take care of his children so he gave them away, trusting in the hands of the betters.

However, John did not mean that he was happy with what Sherlock chose to do with his daughters. John was willing to raise them with him and provide all the help he could give only if Sherlock would let him. Only if Sherlock could just see him. That he was there with him when Alice was gone. Had always been there through thick and thin with him from the very beginning. And would continue to be there for him for the rest of the time. Only if he could just see that.

No matter how willing John was to keep the children, he had no say to that. Sherlock was the father. John was just his business partner, his friend, nothing more.

""Are you saying that you care, Watson?"" Bea's voice pulled him to the present. She was watching him with the judging eyes, always so doubtful, always not so easily trusting.

John couldn't help a little smirk. ""What do you think?""

Bea studied his face fiercely before giving the answer. ""The information still not sufficient. I'll need to gather more in order to conclude.""

John could only cocked his head to that. What more could he say? It wasn't like he would outright admit that so easily.

""Well,"" Bea continued. ""Sorry that it's a bit hard to believe that you care, you know."" She didn't look at him anymore. Her eyes flicked to the fire in the hearth. ""When you seemed to know how difficult our lives were, how hard we were struggling to live. How hard finding a roof over our heads.""

""Who do you think recommended Mrs. Hudson's cellar to you?""

She looked back at him instantly and then frowned. ""It was a boy I once worked with at one job.""

""Who do you think told that boy to tell you of that place? And did you really think Mrs. Hudson would let a group of street kids with barely enough money for a month rent the place without question?""

Bea's eyes were wide in surprise. ""Have you been stalking us?""

""No."" John leaned back against the back of the couch. ""We - Sherlock and I - had a group of street kids we occasionally used to gain information from the places -""

""That's not suitable for the people like you,"" Bea interrupted.

""Not only that."" John continued. ""Nothing paranormal or supernatural regarding the use of these kids. Just plain information. You wouldn't believe how fast news spread among the streets -""

""I wouldn't believe?"" Bea was looking at him. Unbelievable, she said through her facial expression. John glared warningly at her to shut up. Then he continued.

""His own personal network as he called it. That's why I was able to find you even when you were constantly moving from place to place.""

""Have you been stalking us?"" Bea asked again. Seriously, couldn't she just believe what he said for once?

John looked her dead in the eyes. ""I was... looking out for you. Just checking on you from time to time. Not stalking you. Especially after seeing that you'd found your own family.""

""I've done marvelously without any parents, don't you think?"" She must have wanted it to come out as sarcastic. But her tone of voice lacked the intent.

So John just simply answered. ""Yes, you have. But you would do better with one.""

John could not believe himself that he was doing this. All he thought was that the apartment was so quiet when living alone. He had never been alone since he'd moved in with Sherlock.

For once in this night, Bea was speechless. She was looking at him with a lot of questions dancing in her eyes, thinking, calculating, doubting. Then there was a flicker of hope. And then fear. And then understanding. And at last, the determination.

""I don't think that you actually want this, Watson. I don't think you really want us to be your family. I think you are just lonely.""

Now she'd just rendered him speechless. Like a slap in the face. A bucket of freezing water over his head. John swiftly got up from his seat. Suddenly needed a drink.

""We can be your friends."" Bea's voice stopped him as he was about to walk across the room. He turned to her. ""Did you actually mean it when you said to me earlier that you're not going anywhere?""

John held her gaze, swallowing the lump in his throat before he could breathe the words out. ""Yes, I meant it.""

To his astonishment, Bea smiled at him. The real smile. The kind that made her eyes wrinkle.

""Then I'll be there for you, too, Watson. You don't have to be alone. We all will be there. As your friends.""

John couldn't help forming a smile that matched with hers. And then a smile turned into a chuckle when a flash of old memories rushing to his mind.

""What?"" Bea demanded.

He ducked his face and shook his head a little. ""It was just... He used to say this to me once.

Sherlock's voice ringing in his mind. 'You don't have to be alone, John. Why don't you move in with me? Besides, we will work the cases better if we live together. What do you think, John?'

""We are not him."" Bea's voice again pulled John to the present. ""We will be better friends than him."" She said with a smile so wide, clearly joking.

""I don't know."" John crossed his arms. ""We've been friends for just a day -""

""More like ten minutes.""

""Right. Ten minutes. How can I compare? Wait for five years and we will see.""

She chuckled but with a look in her eyes telling him that she'd accepted the challenge.

She rose from her seat and walked over to him.

""May I ask you for one more thing?"" She asked. And after he nodded she continued. ""No more talk about himfrom now on. I don't want you to end up like him, living in deep sorrow, sinking in grief.

""Being friends for ten minutes and you tell me what to do already?""

""I've just realised it was a bad idea asking about him. Also, I don't think that Jessie will want anything to do with him.""

""I can see why.""

""Should I put on a sign that says 'In this house, we don't talk about Sherlock Holmes' to remind you not to?""

He huffed a laugh. ""I don't think that will be helpful.""

Bea giggled.

""What about you, are you alright?"" John sincerely wanted to know. The last time they met, she was more than broken. But judging by the way her eyes brightened and her smile wider than he had ever seen. Her problem most likely was already gone. Which meant...

""Leo is back and he won't have to marry the princess anymore. I don't know how he did it. And I don't say that he won't one day get married ever. But this is... We will have more time to treasure together."" 

John smiled just for how happy she was. ""Great. I thought we had to put on a sign that says 'In this house, we don't talk about Prince Leopold', as well.""

This time she laughed.

""Ah... Nice touch,"" John smirked, looking his lover over and stroking the curve of Sherlock's bare arse as the detective draped himself across his lap. The fluffy, bunny-tail lingerie - complete with fluffy, white ears - was already playing at his arousal and he knew he wouldn't be able to resist the temptation much longer. ""The carrot, that is... Although, the tail definitely adds something to it.""


 


Sherlock's back arched teasingly, curving up into the calloused fingers of John's left hand, as he let out a hum of amusement. ""Mmm, yes... I'd hoped you'd like that,"" he answered, his icy eyes alight with mischief. ""Carrots are good for your eyes, after all... but, you already knew that, didn't you, Doctor?""


 


A light chuckle rumbled up from John's chest as his eyes raked over the man in his lap once again. He slid a finger beneath the blue silk strap that accentuated the lift of Sherlock's arse and licked his lips thoughtfully, pulling back on the elastic strap before letting it go with a harsh snap. The sound sent a bolt of desire straight through to his groin and his smirk only grew. ""True... I did know that, love,"" he replied, his thoughts drifting further and further away from the religious purity usually associated with the upcoming holiday. ""I believe I heard someone say that they were good for your arse, as well.""


 


The quirk of a perfectly manicured eyebrow signaled intrigue on Sherlock's part, but he tried his best not to let it show. ""Ah, did you, now?""


 


""Indeed, I did... Want to find out if it's true or...?""


 


Sherlock scoffed, his eyes narrowing playfully. ""You can't be serious.""


 


A full-blown smile broke out over John's features and he couldn't help but laugh. ""No, I'm not, but you can't deny that I had you going there for a moment,"" he answered, digging his fingernails into the fleshy underside of the other man's arse.


 


Hissing softly, Sherlock melted into the touch, his hips rutting eagerly into the taught muscle of John's thigh as he felt his desperation mounting. ""Hmph, only in your wildest dreams,"" he huffed.


 


""Mmm, you can say that again,"" the doctor purred, squeezing the detective's arse once again. ""You in lingerie is definitely in my top three sexiest dreams I've ever had.""


 


Another hiss slipped past the detective's lips, this time accompanied by a quiet moan. His thickening erection rubbed teasingly back and forth as his hips set a steady rhythm, but his satisfaction was cut short. A sharp swat to his arse elicited a short yelp of pain from Sherlock's throat and he glared disapprovingly over his shoulder.


 


""Not yet, you don't,"" John warned in his best 'Captain Watson' voice, tracing his fingers over his lover's crease as he tugged a bottle of lubricant from behind one of the cushions on the sofa. ""If you're supposed to be my gift, then it's only fair that I get to open you up.""


 


The double entendre was not lost on Sherlock; his hips twitched eagerly but he did his best to stay still. ""Then, by all means, take your time,"" he huffed, shifting so that he could prop himself up on his elbows. The carrot hit the floor with a soft 

thump

 as the click of the lubricant bottle prepared him for the slick coolness of John's middle finger brushing over his entrance.


 


""Oh, I plan to,"" John growled, swirling the pad of his finger around Sherlock's hole before pressing gently against the furled muscle. ""I'm going to turn you inside out and wreck you completely all without touching your cock... but, first, you're going to suck me off with a smile on your face. Then, and only then, are you going to be allowed to come... Do I make myself clear?"" he asked, fixing Sherlock with a hardened stare in order to assert his unwavering dominance over the situation.


 


The subtle spark of interest in the detective's eyes roared into a blazing fire of arousal and he chewed his lip, allowing his submissive side to take complete control of his actions. ""Yes, sir... Whatever you wish..."" 


 


John's cock gave a twitch of approval as the title rolled off of Sherlock's tongue and the tip of his own tongue darted out to wet his lips. The heat of the moment pooled deep in his groin, sending a shiver down his spine as he realized he had his detective right where he wanted him.


 



Well... almost...

31 days before John and Mary's wedding



""Chinese or Italian?"" John asks distractedly as he shuffles through the takeout drawer, jumping at the opportunity to sneak in some high-cal, greasy food. The wedding is a month away, and Mary's been keeping a close eye on both their diets (""I have a dress to fit into, you have a suit. If I have to suffer, I'm taking you down with me.""). A bit too close. ""Sherlock?""

""Yes?""

""I asked, do you want-"" John says, throwing a careless glance in the direction Sherlock had just been staring.

What he finds there is the handyman Mrs. Hudson has had around the past few weeks, installing new sconces in the kitchen. She'd recently come into some money and decided that, following the flat's fall into disrepair while Sherlock was away, the time has come for some refurbishing.

More precisely --and more to the point-- Sherlock was staring at the man's arse, hanging mid-air like a denim-clad pinata.


Oh. 


""John?""

""Erm..."" John squints, squints very hard, because what he thinks just happened couldn't have really happened. ""Yeah?""

""Do I want to, what?"" Sherlock asks.

""What?""

""You asked whether I wanted to...""

""Oh, right,"" John says. ""Do you... do you want to order in or go out?""

""Mary doesn't want you eating out,"" Sherlock says, and John has to shake his head to remind himself that Sherlock is very rarely aware of double entendres, no matter how unfortunate they are. ""You still have those extra four pounds to lose if you want to get into that suit.""

John clears his throat, blushing despite himself. ""It's two and a half.""

""Mary and I think it's four,"" Sherlock says nonchalantly, staring down his microscope. John would have let it slide if it weren't for a barely-audible chuckle coming from Mr. Perfect Arse up on the ladder.

""It's barely two and a half, and I look just fine in the suit,"" John says. ""Look, do you want to eat or not?""

""I suppose outside is fine,"" Sherlock says with an overly-dramatic sigh, standing up from his chair.

""Get on with it, then."" John huffs, stealing another glance up the ladder before he leaves the kitchen. He manhandles Sherlock hurriedly towards the stairs before Sherlock even has a chance to tie his scarf.

""What's got into you?""

""Nothing,"" John sulks. ""Just go.""









28 days before John and Mary's wedding



John pushes the street door to 221 with his right shoulder, biting his lips in concentration. The two boxes he's carrying contain the kits for making their weddings favours - ones Sherlock had agreed to help in assembling - are not heavy, per se, but they are big and obstruct much of his view. Carrying them from the car park was a challenge that demanded a good measure of coordination and side-stepping, to avoid bumping into unsuspecting pedestrians.

He balances himself against the wall, wiping the sweat trickling down his temple. It's been an unseasonably warm couple of days. Mrs. Hudson's kitchen is quiet, so there's no one to jovially greet him there or maybe, just maybe, offer a cold drink before he trudges up the remaining stairs. Looking up at them with a frown, he takes a deep breath and starts his journey upstairs.

Still grunting, he's far too distracted to register the familiar voice coming from the depth of the flat. ""Would you, er,"" Sherlock clears his throat in uncharacteristic hesitation, ""would you like some lemonade?""

""Cheers,"" a man's breathy voice says cheerily. ""Would love some.""

John freezes mid-movement.


Mr. Pinata.


He'd completely forgotten about him; by the time they came back to Baker Street the other day, the man wasn't there anymore, so John just dismissed Sherlock's wandering eyes as a one-time fluke. Or so he thought.

John, still frozen in place with his mouth hanging open, hears a glass placed on the counter; then he hears what must be the proffered lemonade being poured. There's a short, loud silence in the flat, and then-

""'S lovely,"" The man says, sighing contentedly. ""Did you make it?""

John nearly snorts at the mere thought. As if Sherlock would ever-

""Yes,"" Sherlock says, wiping John's smug smile.

""It's gorgeous.""

Oh, John swallows, his chest tightening. Bloody hell.

""Your name is... Rory?""

The other man hums in confirmation.

""I'm-""

""Sherlock Holmes,"" Rory says. John's brain is a hot, fuzzy mess right now, but it manages to pick up on the man's heavy Australian accent. ""Yeah, I know who you are. They say you're a bloody genius.""

""I don't know who they are,"" Sherlock says haughtily, ""but they're not wrong.""

Rory laughs brightly, easily. ""No Dr. Watson today?""

John tries to swallow again, heart pounding, and it's then that he realizes that he can't because his mouth is hanging open. He stands there, boxes in hands, looking back and forth between the stairs and the door as though even these inanimate objects would agree that this is... weird.

Should he... leave? Is he... interrupting? This is clearly flirting, isn't it?

""Dr. Watson's busy,"" Sherlock says matter-of-factly. ""Wedding preparations.""

""I suppose it's just the two of us, then.""

""I suppose it is.""

And it's then that John's brain rebels in the face of whatever fresh hell this situation is, because - Christ.


Getting married, John. He's your best man, John. 


""No, actually. I'm right here,"" he moves with a grunt to open the door, putting the boxes down - nonchalantly, of course. As nonchalantly as one can muster carrying wedding favors during a hot jealous streak for the person he is most certainly not marrying.

Amidst Sherlock's surprised 'John?' and Rory's friendly 'Dr. Watson!', he takes in their arrangement. Rory is on his knees facing the under-sink cabinet, wrench in hand. Sherlock stands next to him, holding Rory's empty glass.

""Am I, er... interrupting anything?""

""Of course not,"" Sherlock says, finally moving away towards the kitchen table. ""Mr. Adams here was just fixing the sink.""

""Oh, right."" Mr. Adams my arse. ""Didn't you fix that sink a few days ago?""

""I did.""

""I may have..."" Sherlock clears his throat. ""Thrown some things in there that I shouldn't have.""

""Can you believe this guy?"" Rory shakes his head in delight, pointing at Sherlock as he crawls back under the sink.

""Yeah, he's... something,"" John says, his voice edging on shrill. ""Is that lemonade?""

""Excellent deduction skills as always, John.""

""I'd love some.""

""Help yourself,"" Sherlock says as he sits at the table, examining a suspicious looking petri dish. Rory peeks his head out of the cabinet in search of something or another in his toolbox, sending another smile in John's direction.

""Hope you didn't use the ice from the back of the freezer for this,"" John says, rubbed the wrong way a bit, following Sherlock's dismissal.

""Of course I didn't,"" Sherlock says. 

""The things he keeps in there."" John says. ""Not for the faint-hearted.""

""Nothing I haven't seen before."" Rory shrugs. ""Was a Park Ranger myself back home. Takes a lot to surprise me. Ever been to Australia, Dr. Watson?""

""Just an overnight stop on the way to New Zealand,"" John says. Sherlock hums mysteriously next to him.

""New Zealand's nothing compared to Queensland, believe me,"" Rory says. ""Aren't you getting married soon?""

""Er, yes.""

""You should take the missus to Australia for your honeymoon, mate,"" Rory whispers conspiratorially. ""They do 'glamping now these days; you sleep in a fancy tent with electricity and wha' not. It's dead right in the middle of a nature reserve - very romantic. Plenty of exotic nature and time to do nothing much but stay in bed,"" Rory looks between Sherlock and John, adding a knowing wink, ""if you catch my drift.""

John smiles tightly. ""Yes, I think I do.""

""The Indonesian Indian cobra is the fifteenth deadliest snake in the world, and all the other fourteen are in Australia,"" Sherlock blurts, apropos of nothing. The other two men turn to look at him, frowning. ""Let's just say that given their survival skills, the Watsons will have a better time in exotic Brighton.""

John knows he's gone red, flushed from neck to cheeks. ""It was Mary's choice. She's never been.""

""Of course,"" Sherlock says, entirely inscrutable, while Rory nods amiably (""Brighton is very nice too, mate.'').

""So, a park ranger?"" John asks eventually, once the conversation dies down and Rory moves to pour himself another glass of lemonade.

""Yeah, right outside Brisbane.""

""How'd you end up a handyman in London?""

""Oh, you know how it is,"" Rory says. ""Got sick of all of those poisonous creatures. Snakes and fish and spiders. Couldn't stand them after a while. People getting bitten and coming crying to me about it, even though we tell them to be careful. They never listen.""

""Fair enough.""

""You know what the best way to avoid dying from a snake bite is?"" Rory asks.

John raises a curious eyebrow.

""Don't get bitten!"" Rory and Sherlock say simultaneously, exchanging a small, surprised smirk.

""Besides,"" Rory smiles, a charming, disarming, Australian smile that's very clearly not directed at John. His next words aren't, either. ""Always been good with my hands,"" he says before disappearing back under the sink.







There's a flurry of activity in Baker Street later that evening, with Mrs. Hudson bringing up dinner, Lestrade popping in to say hi and drop off a case, and even a client that scuttles away in a hurry before ever reaching the door when Sherlock makes himself quite clear he will not, under any circumstances, be ""aiding and abetting narcissistic Neo-Nazis.""

John barely registers any of it, what with the relentless alarm bells going off in his head.

There's a deep pit in his stomach, getting deeper with every passing second as his eyes bore a hole at Sherlock's nape. The detective sits on the floor with his back to John, gathering the last of the favours into the big carton box.

You're in trouble, a small voice whispers somewhere in the back of his brain. You're in deep, deep trouble, Watson.

""All done,"" Sherlock says suddenly with a lopsided grin, and John feels like a deer in a headlight. He hums, because there's not much else he can say in his current state, and watches as Sherlock gets up from the floor, walking away.

""I'm off for a shower. You can see yourself out?""

John can't feel his hands. He wants to say so many things. Pathetic, greedy, unfair things filled with feelings he should not be feeling, not a month before his wedding. ""Sherlock?""

""Yes?""


Listen, I know I'm getting married but could you please not flirt with the gorgeous Australian? 


(Oh God)


Do you ever flirt back?


(You should, you know. In another place, another time, I would have-)


Have you ever been with a man? 


(Bloody hell)


Have you ever been with anyone at all?


(Fuck)


Why now, Sherlock? Why him?


""John?"" Sherlock sizes him up, his eyes sharp and keen and curious.

""Nothing, nothing."" He swallows again. ""Good night, Sherlock.""








21 days before John and Mary's wedding


The next Saturday is Rory-free and the weather is a complete and utter contrast to the day of The Lemonade Incident, as John has since come to call it. Baker Street is freezing cold, despite the roaring fire in the old fireplace. Sometime last night the sky had opened up and it's been pouring rain ever since, dampening John's already-sour mood further.

He stares at the kettle, waiting for it to boil. While Sherlock and Mary have been obsessing over seating arrangements, he's been relegated to tea making due to his general moping about and grumpily voicing all the (apparently) wrong opinions.

The kettle boils, filling the flat with sounds of whistling steam and burbling water. Mary's hushed whisper travels from her place on the sofa.

""Did you ask him?""

""No, not yet.""

""Well, what are you waiting for?"" She asks in an urgent hush. ""Mrs. Hudson says he's lovely. I'm sure he'll say yes.""

John's hand freezes mid-movement; he half-turns squinting, straining his ear in concentration.


(I'm fine. It's fine!)


""He's in a committed relationship with a woman, Mary."" Sherlock whispers back. ""I don't think he much goes for that sort of thing.""

""You won't know till you ask,"" Mary says in that pushy sort of way she does that John had always found so lovely. ""And there's not much time left, you know. We'll need to know before we finalize everything. I'll ask him myself if you won't.""

""Mary-""

S""Please don't tell me the great Sherlock Holmes is too shy to ask-""

""Alright!"" Sherlock snaps, shushing her. ""Alright.""

""There's a good man.""

(It's all fine.)







John's not fine.








19 days before John and Mary's wedding


""I'm afraid I'm a bit under the weather today, Mrs. Hudson, Mr. Holmes,"" Rory says from the kitchen, wiping his dirty hands on a used flannel. John steals a furtive glance from his chair by the window as he types up their most recent case; an unsolved one, about a guardsman that nearly died in John's hands. ""Would you be very upset if I came back some other day to finish the sealing on the windows?""

""Oh dear, of course not,"" Mrs. Hudson coos, the same way she always does at handsome young men. ""I hope it's nothing serious.""

""You're too kind,"" he waves a dismissive hand. ""Just a little under the weather. Might be a bit of a stomach flu.""

""Yes, that's been making the rounds recently. John here is a doctor, you know,"" she says, dragging Rory into the sitting room. ""John, dear? Rory isn't feeling well. Any doctorly advice?""

""Probably best if you just leave."" John blurts over the static in his brain that seems to be ever-present in the presence of the handyman. When he looks up, he finds six pairs of eyes looking curiously his way. He clears his throat. ""To rest. And drink plenty of liquid, of course."" He huffs uncomfortably, slowly transitioning into incoherent mumbling. ""That's sort of a stupid thing to say, isn't it? 'Cause you can't drink a solid, can you?""

Sherlock's forehead creases in confusion. ""Soup?""

""What?""

""Soup is solids suspended in liquid,"" Sherlock says, ""so it qualifies as a liquid.""

John smiles sourly. ""See that? Sherlock here is a graduate chemist, so occasionally that's useful.""

""Occasionally?"" Sherlock turns his sharp eyes at him, affronted. ""I've built a thriving career thanks to it.""

""I should go. Thank you, Dr. Watson,"" Rory says, offering one last apologetic smile, bending down to pick up his hoards of tools boxes. Before he comes up, though, he doubles back, dizzy. ""Oh.""

""Boys, help him."" Mrs. Hudson commands them with a half-whisper that never fails to get them to do exactly as she says. Both Sherlock and John march quickly across the room. Sherlock picks one toolbox (the lighter one, of course, the wanker), as John picks the other. It's all fine until he straightens up, grunting at the weight of it, and-


Fuck.


He's betrayed by the telling sound of his back cracking like a twig, closing his eyes with a mixture of stabbing pain and embarrassment flushing up his body.

""John?"" Sherlock asks. ""Are you alright?""

""Ahhhr.""

""You're not alright,"" Sherlock says, and John hates himself for loving the hint of worry in the detective's voice.

""Oh, my."" Mrs. Hudson whispers, clutching her own cheeks. He thinks. He can't actually see her, what with his vision has gone black.

""Blimey,"" Rory says, quickly shaking off his own general malaise. ""Let me... take this from you, mate.""

""Mmm.""

Sherlock turns to him, admonishing. ""Always lift with your knees, John-""

""Mmmm-"" He grunts with pain as Mrs. Hudson gently leads him to the sofa.

""You're not a young man anymore-""

""Yes, thank you for the reminder, Sherlock-""

""Mary's going to kill you-""

""Shut up, Sherlock!"" John calls out through a haze of blinding pain and cold sweat.

""What should I do?"" Sherlock looks down at him hesitantly.

""Move the pillows,"" John grunts. ""And something for the pain.""

Sherlock nods obediently, turning on his heels with a swish of his robe.

""Wait, Sherlock, look!"" Mrs. Hudson tuts, pointing to a box by the fireplace. ""He might need that. You go on, don't let him go without it. I'll take care of this one here.""

""But-""

""Go!""

John listens to Sherlock's footsteps as he heads downstairs, shutting his eyes tightly.

""Here you go,"" Mrs. Hudson says, helping him sit up. ""Brought you some water, too.""

He takes the proffered pills and downs them, taking a big long breath as he lies back down. Mrs. Hudson sits on the table next to him, patting his hand lovingly. ""Is that better?""

""Mmmm,"" he croaks, his voice strained. ""Wasn't even that heavy.""

""Looked plenty heavy to me,"" she says kindly, and he can't help but smile at the goodwill. ""It's the wedding jitters, if you ask me,"" she stage-whispers, winking. ""You'll be as good as new in no time.""

""I hope so.""

""You men are too proud to admit that, but you must be nervous."" She says. ""I know I was. I was terrified. I kept thinking, 'Am I really choosing to spend the rest of my life with this man?'. Sounds mad! But he was the love of my life, Mr. Hudson was."" She hums. ""There was nobody else for me.""

John stares at the ceiling, his vision blurring with dread.

""You love Mary,"" she waves dismissively. ""You know what I mean.""

""Of course.""

""Of course,"" she nods knowingly, falling silent for a long, stretching moment. ""He's a nice young man, Rory is,"" she says with a side-glance. ""Isn't he?""

""Yeah,"" he says, his voice sounding unnaturally mechanical.

""He's been coming over a lot. I think he fancies Sherlock.""

John swallows. ""Imagine that.""

""It's nice, dear. So very good for both of you. You moved on, he moved on."" She smiles again, nodding. It's a warm, understanding thing. ""It's going to be a great wedding.""

John lifts his chin, his lips pursed stubbornly, holding back a deluge of stifled words; words he's been expertly pushing down for years. He looks up at her wordlessly and he wonders -- not for the first time -- if she knows.


Of course she knows.


""You rest, now."" She pats his hand one last time, covering him with a blanket. He resigns himself to the powerful wave of pain medication doing its job. Right on time. ""There you go.""











14 days before John and Mary's wedding


""Sherlock!"" Lestrade bursts through the street door to 221b, John in tow, rushing in from the mortuary after receiving a call that the Camden Lock Garroter (a locksmith!) was --to everyone's surprise-- found hiding inside a tree trunk in Hampstead Heath.

Sherlock, who'd spent the morning pestering Molly at Barts, had disappeared hours ago and hasn't been answering the phone since.

Lestrade is, understandably, fuming. ""Sherlock!""

""Sherlock!"" John joins the chorus, running up behind the DI; their adrenaline pumping through their veins, they take the stairs two at a time, excitedly.

""You'd better not be sleeping, you bastard!"" Lestrade says, ripping the door to the sitting room open; he stops in his place so abruptly John is left with no choice but to bump straight into the man's back. ""What the-""

""What..."" John recovers quickly, taking a step back. What he sees when he peeks over the DI's shoulder is so unexpected, so strange, he shakes his head like a dog out of water. ""Sherlock?""

""Don't you knock, Lestrade?"" Sherlock huffs indignantly.

There's Rory, and there's Sherlock, with his shirt sleeves rolled up and his robe thrown haphazardly over his shoulders. The two stand in the middle of the sitting room, all furniture cleared and pushed against the walls.

And they're standing... Close. Intimately close. It's then that John's other senses finally kick in, and everything suddenly makes sense. There's music. A waltz. And the cleared furniture, and Rory's flushed face.


Dancing.


Rory and Sherlock have been... dancing.

""Hello, Dr. Watson,"" Rory says, sending a cheery smile. Lestrade turns to look at John with an inscrutable smile that John really has to work hard to ignore, otherwise he'd have no choice but to punch the man.

Rory clears his throat. ""Looks like our secret is out, Mr. Holmes.""

""It would seem so.""

""What's going on?"" Lestrade asks.

""What do you think is going on?"" Sherlock says petulantly. ""Mr. Adams and I are rehearsing.""

""Rehearsing what?"" Lestrade asks, endlessly amused.

""John and Mary's waltz.""

""What?"" John frowns.

""Mary asked me to teach you how to waltz for the wedding, but I needed help road testing the piece before I take on that monumental, and dare I say impossible, task,"" Sherlock says. ""Rory's about your size and build. It was only logical to practice the steps with him first.""

""Oh,"" John blinks. Oh. Blinks again. Rewinding back through every second over the past couple of weeks. Oh.

""This is all very lovely, Fred Astaire, but we have eyes on Peters in Hampstead Heath."" Lestrade says.

Sherlock's eyes widen in surprise. ""I was right!""

""Of course you bloody were,"" Lestrade says. ""Go, for Christ's sake! Get dressed!""

""Excuse me!"" Sherlock says excitedly, tearing himself away from Rory who stands in the middle of the sitting room, shuffling his legs uncomfortably.

""I suppose I'll just-"" Rory points hesitantly at the door, moving past them on his way out. ""Nice to see you again.""

""Yeah."" John sniffs, watching the handyman leaving, perfect arse and all. ""Off you go.""







John spends the rest of the evening avoiding Lestrade's knowing eyes.







""You didn't have to punch him,"" Sherlock says, his voice deep and warm, as they reach the flat a few hours later, breathless and red-cheeked from exertion.

John giggles, a high-pitched, deeply satisfied thing. ""I didn't, but he's a murderer,"" he says, and a deep rumble escapes Sherlock. ""And a right bastard.""

""That he is,"" Sherlock says, removing his scarf.

""What are we going to call this one?"" John says, stepping into the sitting room.

""The Nestled Locksmith? Behind Trunk and Key?""

""Skeyletons in the Closet?""

""Good lord, John,"" Sherlock rolls his eyes imperiously and John can't help another bellyful of giggles.

""I'll figure something out,"" John promises and Sherlock hums contently in response.

John scans the room again, remembering waltzes and Rorys. He bites his lips. ""So.""

Sherlock perks a brow, curious.

""A waltz?""

""A fairly standard one."" Sherlock shrugs. ""At Mary's request.""

John rocks uncomfortably on the balls of his feet. ""You dance?""

""What if I do?""

John can't help a crooked smile at that. He straightens where he stands, eyes the man standing in front him from head to toe. Sherlock looks back, challenging, measuring. Of course you do, you bastard, he wants to say. You have the body of a dancer. A tall, gorgeous, broody dancer.

""Teach me,"" John says, spreading his hands invitingly.

""What?""

""You've been practicing with Mr. Handyman so you could teach me,"" John says. ""Haven't you?""

""I have.""

""Well, here I am. The real thing,"" he says, taking a step closer. ""Teach me.""

Sherlock eyes him for a long, tense beat, and John finds himself bracing for a brusque rejection, a cruel joke at his expense.

He takes another step forward, holding his breath, closing the distance. They're nearly touching now; almost, but not yet. There's a crease in Sherlock's forehead he can't seem to decipher, so he tries again. ""I've waltzed before, you know. I'm not a complete basket case.""

Sherlock swallows. ""Did you?""

""My aunt loved it."" He nods. ""Said I was her favorite dance partner.""

Sherlock's eyes narrow, sparkling mischievously. ""How old were you?

""Eight."" He says, pushing down a crooked grin.

""That's not very promising.""

""Shut your bloody mouth,"" John says, cupping Sherlock's shoulder blade with his right hand, reaching for Sherlock's hand with the other. ""And dance.""

""What do you think you're doing?""

John frowns, his eyes shooting up to Sherlock's. ""I'm- I'm leading.""

""No, you're not."" Sherlock shakes his head. ""I need to see how you follow first.""

""But-""

""Who's the teacher, John?"" Sherlock says imperiously. He gathers John into his arms, taking over the leading position.

John's eyes slide shut inadvertently, drawn to Sherlock's warmth, taken by surprise by his gentle grasp. ""You are,"" he croaks, all fight in him gone. Doesn't bloody matter, as long you stay right there.

""Ready?"" Sherlock asks, grabbing the remote control with a stretch of his arm.

""Hmmm,"" is all John can offer in return.

And then they dance.







He's downright bereft when Sherlock leaves his side mid-dance, taking with him the comforting wall of heat his body is.

He's left wanting when Sherlock moves to remove his jacket; has to pull his hands away to prevent them from balling possessively around the man's midsection as he steps away.

(He perks right up with the new sensation underneath the crispy-white thin fabric).

He finds -- rather quickly and unsurprisingly -- that he is yet again in very big trouble. He does not want to lose this precious access to Sherlock's body - not tonight, not ever. He definitely does not wish to yield said access to other people, namely bright-eyed Australians in snug, stone-washed Levi's.

The waltz is haunting and unfamiliar; there is something joyous in the melody, but every now and then there's just a tinge of sadness. It is a song of love and pain, a congratulation and a goodbye; it pulls at John's heartstrings, a perfect soundtrack for the beating of his traitorous heart. And Sherlock... Sherlock is a wonderful teacher and a beautiful dancer and he smells like sandalwood and freshly-cut Hampstead Heath grass and home and--


Shit.


Sherlock unfurls himself from John's grip again. He moves to the table, grabbing a pencil and marking something on a sheet of notes. John studies his back, using the moment to catch his wrecked breath. Sherlock's head tilts in concentration, and he scribbles another quick note.

John frowns in confusion. ""What are you doing?""

""An adjustment.""

""To what?""

""To the piece.""

""What piece?""

""The waltz, John,"" Sherlock says, and John's chest tightens.

""You..."" he starts, his face clouding. He feels dizzy. ""You wrote this?""

Sherlock's tall figure freezes at the question. He clears his throat and turns, scanning John's face in that way he always does when he can't be sure what sort of trouble he's got himself into. ""John?""

John wobbles, heart hammering in his chest. ""Did you?""

""Yes,"" Sherlock concedes, ducking his head. ""It's a... gift. ""

""Oh,"" John says. ""For... Mary and me?""

Sherlock hums. He steps back into John's personal space, coming closer and closer. ""Mostly for you. A... parting gift, of sorts.""


Parting?


""Oh. That's--"" He says, blinking hard against a hint of moisture there, slowly scratching his beard. Sherlock is close, so close it's intoxicating. John looks up, searching for the other man's eyes. Where are you going? His own eyes ask. ""That's--""

""John?""

He takes a deep, stuttering breath as his hands bunch a piece of fabric on Sherlock's waist, holding on for dear life. ""You're...""

""What?"" Sherlock frowns, shaking his head in confusion. Everything around John sounds drowned out, as though he has gone underwater and all he can think of is Sherlock's breath mingling with his. And then he kisses him - oh god, I'm kissing him - and Sherlock sighs (lightly, contentedly), and John's hands spread open, holding on tightly and pulling him down (he's kissing me back, he's kissing back).

The pull throws them off their feet and Sherlock sways, teetering forward (good, better, more, more). They kiss, and kiss, until last note hovers in the air, whittling out with a flourished finality that has no place in this moment, in this place.

The sound dies away, the moment gone. John comes up for air, rubbing his cheek against Sherlock's.

""John-"" Sherlock says nervously, breathing hard.

""Shhh-""

Sherlock's hands bunch just as possessively against John's back. ""This is-""

""It's perfect, Sherlock,"" John whispers, hugging him tighter. ""It's perfect.""

The words bring such relief to Sherlock, John feels his chest emptying of air; he leans his head against the crook of John's neck. They breathe loudly, raggedly together, both trying to catch up on the reality of the moment.

""Rory,"" John says, apropos of nothing.

Sherlock snuggles closely still. ""What about him?""

""I thought you two were..."" John says, attempting a smile and failing miserably. ""He's been all over you.""

Sherlock smiles nervously. ""He's not really my type, John.""

""Had to stop myself from punching his beautiful face,"" John says. ""Multiple times.""

Sherlock shakes his head. ""John, please. You know me better than that.""

""I've been so jealous, Sherlock."" He admits weakly, shame rushing through his veins.

""I know the feeling,"" Sherlock says, looking down and away.

The admission hits John like a lightning bolt, and he wonders if Sherlock will ever be able to pick up his remains from the messy heap on the floor. The decision (if there really ever was one) is made swiftly, like a band-aid ripped in one fell swoop. It doesn't hurt nearly as bad as it probably should, and later he will ask himself what his life would have looked like if he'd made another choice.

But that's all hyperbole, and in the past now.

John grabs Sherlock's hand, squeezing it. Sherlock's flushed and beautiful, and John doesn't want another minute wasted. ""I have to go.""

""John-""

""I have something to take care of,"" he says, looking at Sherlock meaningfully. ""I'll be back in an hour. Maybe two. Hopefully one.""

""We're..."" Sherlock says, worried-looking. ""We've not finished practicing.""

""We're... not going to need it,"" John says with a hesitant half-smile, shrugging into his jacket. ""You could write a new one while I'm gone.""

""A new one?""

""'A waltz for Sherlock and John',"" he says, grabbing the door. ""How does that sound?""

And Sherlock smiles, a smile John has never seen before, and he knows that for the first time in his lifetime of misguided, miserable choices, he's finally made the right one.

Usually, these days would be spent moping around the flat, having occasional mental meltdowns and the rare phantom hallucinations of his deceased flatmate moving along the premises of the flat, with his dressing robe dragging on the floor. John had to practically yell at his brain to stop all this nonsense

'God, I wish I had that memory-deleting ability of that bastard. Sure would be convenient to ease all of this'

The thought was accompanied by a vague gesture of both the blond's hands, waving at his surrounding, which was their flat. Despise cursing to forget all of this, forget his time with Sherlock, deep down John knew if he could, he wouldn't After all the memories were too precious to him, almost as precious as the man those memories were shared with. Bloody sentiments

'I guess this is why Sherlock always says - well said that sentiment was a weakness'

The doctor chuckled sadly, his left hand covering his face as he leaned against the wall of the living room. No sooner had he put his hand down than he caught sight of the smiled made by numerous bullets, courtesy of bloody Sherlock Holmes on one of his deemed boring days. Almost instantly, John felt his stomach twist in pain.

"" BASTARD, FUCKING TWAT"" He screamed, punching the wall in a fit of frustration, ignoring the pain slowly creeping in on his hand and the rattling of the wall decorations.

'This is fucking ridiculous. I was a soldier for fuck sake, I killed people, I watched my comrades die before my eyes, and none of that shit managed to break me and yet Sherlock Holmes with his bloody high cheekbones, icy blue eyes, arrogant attitude, mysterious black coat, snarky remarks, inconsiderate nature and that oh-so-damn brilliant mind of his did. I am supposed to be stronger than this. I am supposed to...

Before John could continue to battle with his mind, a sudden knock snapped him back to reality.

"" John, how are you today, dear."" 

It was Mrs. Hudson

"" No better than a man who witnessed his best friend commit suicide right in front of his eyes "" He replied, mustering a light-hearted tone to mask his real emotions, he even added to dismissive wave for good measure.

Unfortunately, Mrs. H here wanted none of that shit. Scrunching her nose up which made her eyes look squinted, looking like she was looking straight through his soul. Though not long after, her face dropped into one of sympathy and sadness.

John shifted his feet in discomfort and slight annoyance. He hated receiving looks like that, they made him feel weak and so exposed. Despite knowing the kind landlady just wanted to help him through his difficult time, it had proven impossible for John to ignore his rather negative emotions about Mrs. Hudson's expression

"" Oh dear boy, I know this is very difficult for you, given the rather intimate relationship between the two of you. Sherlock never had a lot of friends. Believe me, not many have that patience of yours to get to know him truly.""She started 

"" Mrs. Hudson, I have ready told you, I am not gay. Sherlock and I were never a thing"" John retorted. Truth to be told, He himself wasn't even sure if the words that had come out of his mouth were true. It's not like he was disgusted by the thought of being attracted to a bloke but this is Sherlock we are talking about, the one who always deemed relationship to be beneath him. The first meeting had proven and solidified this idea very well, to the point that to John, it was as blatantly true as the bloody solar system or other common facts.

"" Oh, an old lady like I can dream"" She responded playfully, waving her hand around in an attempt to lighten the atmosphere.

Not wanting to upset Mrs. Hudson and maybe himself, John only chuckled along with her.

"" Now since I have gotten you to lighten up a bit, here- she said as a bag of cookies was offered to John- I made a little too much . Might as well let you enjoy some goodies. And do remember to clean all this mess up, dear. I am your landlady, not your housekeeper, John""

And with that, she was out the doors, not without giving a last assuring glance at the army doctor.Closing the doors, John fell back to his robotic state, slumping against the wall

"" God if only you knew how people care about you, Sherlock. Always going on and on about being a sociopath, having no friends but you have friends , people who care about you. They care about you , bloody idiot .-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I care about you""


God, if anyone sees me now, they will think I am a complete nutter, mourning the death of my best friend more than necessary


 


 Ring ring  


John jumped a little in his position, before realizing it was his phone 

'Of course '

He clumsily reached for it to discover who would have the need to call him during the weekend . Definitely not his patients. The word "" Greg"" popped up brightly on his phone .Pressing the green circle  he bought it up to his ear, preparing to hear whatever that was coming

"" Hello Lestrade, what is it? "" He started 

"" Oh hey J-John"" The man on the other line responded  Despite not being as observant as Sherlock, John could clearly sense the shakiness of his voice and maybe a slight tiredness in it 

"" Lestrade ,have you been sleeping well?  "" The doctor in him started taking over. Really wish the doctor in John would also have the consideration to take care of himself 

"" Oh I-i am quite well - the sound accompanied that statement was a slurping one, which John concluded was Lestrade sipping on his coffee. He hoped it wasn't the coffee at New Scotland Yard as the coffee they offered there was disgusting  with its grainy texture and slimy sensation after you swallowed it. Sure it did its job well  providing the police with enough caffeine to get through the day but dear Lord , he was not going to have another taste of that solution that the officers of New Scotland Yard called coffee. He had tasted better in Afghanistan, even during the supply shortages. 

"" It's just that - Lestrade started again, albeit this time less shaky and more somber in a way - I have been having trouble with this case. My team have worked relentlessly on this shit for days and the progress are being made at snail's paceand we have just barely solved it . And now there is a new murder By God, I wish we had Sher- I mean him here . He would have solved this case in less than 20 minutes  I would even endure a damn lecture of his, telling us off as idiots Now with Anderson and Emalia gone , one due to family affair  one due to her child's accident, we are even more stuck on this case "" Lestrade stopped ,realizing he was rambling 

' Probably due to the stress ' John concluded and silently nodded his head in agreement  despite the fact that the detective inspector wouldn't be able to take notice of that 

"" So - John faked a cough - from what I am hearing is you want me to help you "" He suggested 

The one on the other line swallowed a lump down his throat. 

"" Yes ,I know this is hard for you. But I promise it will be quick  I just need to you to look around the case ,see what caused the victim death and anything strange. I can't afford to take another scolding from my supervisor. But I can't find anyone to stand in for the two at the moment and you're my best bet. I know this is a tad selfish  mate but I just need a few hours of your time "" Lestrade pleaded 

John was surprised for a moment, he never thought Lestrade would be this distressed to need help from him. Sure he accompanied Sherlock on a lot of his cases but he was always in the background, just a decoration, someone who could easily be forgotten. 

"" Lestrade,..  ..  I don't think I can-""

"" John please, I am begging you. You just need to stand in for Anderson and Emalia for one or two days ,only a few hours each. "" 

' Well it wouldn't be hard to help him ,he does sound desperate. I can't possibly leave him like this '

"" Fine , I will help Lestrade but don't come at me when I can't see anything more than you okay ? "" 

"" Oh thank god ,I won't ""

 

 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

"" Okay , Lestrade I will be there in an hour or so"" John bid his goodbye to Lestrade after the Detective Inspector had sent him the address 

' Well since I have nothing to do here, besides acting like a complete lunatic, might as well help Lestrade as much as I can. My therapist did say I needed to get out more often and not only for work' Thought John as he reminisced on his latest session


 [?] 



"" John, I believe some getting out of the house would most likely do you some good""  The sound of Ella's voice barely registered in John's mind



"" Believe me, I tried""  John responded, now rising himself up from the couch on which he had just been lying a few minutes ago to end his session. Bidding Ella a half-hearted goodbye, John took his coat from the coat hanger and walked out the doors. They had been having this conversation for three weeks now and it was beginning to drive him up the damn bullet punctured wall, but he wasn't going to lash out at Ella as she was trying to help him. It was her job and he was at fault for being a stubborn bloke who couldn't even get over these traumas despite having gone to therapy for months



 [?] 


'Maybe I am just too weak, too broken to be fixed'  The idea stung him sharply, more painful than the bullet that shot through his shoulder. Shaking his sandy blond head side to side to shut that idea off, he quickly changed to get ready to go assist Lestrade with a case , without Sherlock , and he was damn determined to keep all of his bubbling shit and turmoil together until he was isolated from the eyes of the public in the flat to break down in peace and weep his eyes till his heart was content, lest he be seen as weak or worse a bloody nutter. 

 

 

"" Here dear, some money for you to spend and have fun. "" A woman said with a sweet tone 

 almost too sweet  it was almost like those cheap candy handed out of obligation on Halloween and would soon be throw in the trash since even a kid would say it was too sweet, too artificial 

while handling a few crumbled bills of fivers and tenners to the young child, most likely hers. Having made the child accept the money, she put on a honey smile and pat his blond head before bidding him farewell

"" Just stay here and have some fun. Mommy will come get you soon after she and her boyfriend have had some private time together "" She said and then walk back to her car, not even bothering to wait for a response from her precious child or find out why he was carrying a backpack a little too big for his size and another bag currently residing in his small hands 

' Like hell you will' The boy thought bitterly ' I can obviously see through your lies, running off with your boyfriend while leaving me behind. How typical ' he finished thinking, wiping off the tear from his left eye but he wasn't going to beg mother to let him stay by her side

As much as he hated the idea of being left behind, he was definitely not going stay with his mother any longer. 

As the car speeded off, he didn't bat an eye at it and quickly went to sit near one of the benches of the entrance of the park, whose location was unfamiliar to him so he concluded that he was probably too far from his house so walking home was a no no and even if he could, there could still be a possibility of the house already being sold off to fuel mother and her boyfriend's addiction. 

Face turning into a grimace, he silent vowed to stay away from those disaster-causing things that can reduce humans to just a bunch of mindless, brainless thugs looking for their next hit .Unlike his once-was-brilliant-but-now-a-dimwit-due-to-drug mother, the boy was bright and mature for his age, too mature - well technically, he had to if he wanted to survive and not get taken advantage of by corrupted and vile adults 

'Honestly if mother is this far gone, I wonder how father is doing? What if he isn't even alive? Great another bad thing added to cons of being an accidental drug baby  '

' And the school taught me that a mother would never abandon her child. Yeah right, those sugar coating jerks' Lamented the boy as he looked out to the scenery of the park with people all going on with their lives so peacefully, so carefree. He envied them. 

' I might as well map out a plan since mother decided that this child is too worthless and expensive to keep, and she needs more time for her boyfriend and her"" Happy pills "" '. His pale hand started to rummage through his bag, pulling out a small paper. 

' good thing I managed to nip a map of London from school before summer break started. Never thought I would one day need this though. And the phone I stole from Mother should come in handy. But calling Mr and Miss police now will be risky and I don't think they will believe me, a child. I need to solve this before summer ends, I need to have a good education if I want to get out of this. I hope birth certificate would come in handy ' 

He remained still for arguably thirty minutes, just observing the scene and the people, taking in every detail of them, connecting the invisible dots in his head. It was a good stress relief, he admitted 

A loud sound interrupted his thinking progress. Turning his head around, the imagine of a police car came into view. 

' Brilliant ' He thought, optimistically for once 

' I can request them for help. Everything is going to be fine. I will be safe . I already packed up everything I would need.Honestly , If mother had wanted to leave me, she should have made more effort to hide that desire from me '

Packing his stuff like lightning, he leaped off his seat and followed the car's trace. The following didn't last so long as the car soon came to a stop before the middle of a street known notoriously for being busy, only that it wasn't today. And the large puddle of blood and many various others of lesser size splattered around may have contributed to this 

Despite the many people stepping back from the bloody scene, the boy just felt compelled to get closer and so he did, ever so carefully. 

 

If anyone has anything to suggest or criticize, please put it in the comment section, I am always game for some improvements, especially in this work as it is my first one

"" Okay Lestrade, I am here "" John greeted the silver-haired detective . And his eyes widened in surprise. 

Dear Christ and Satan's left pierced nipple, he looked horrible, like a piece of tuna drenched in sewage and then eaten and regurgitated by a wolf and then finally mixed with mud . Okay it was a bit exaggerated but you get the idea. 

' Hair messy as a crow's nest, insanely heavy eye bags, look like he is at brink of a bloody breakdown. AND DEAR GOD IS ACTUALLY DRINKING COFFEE FROM THE YARD ' 

John knew that Lestrade was stressed but he didn't know he was this stressed. 

"" Lestrade, mate are you really okay? "" John asked, once again his inner doctor Watson making a spectacular return

It took Lestrade a moment to acknowledge John's existence, let alone register the doctor's question but he soon got to it. Fumbling with the cup of disgusting coffee in his hand and a report file in the other, he went up to John to greet him

"" Hey John, y-yeah i'm fine. Just bloody dandy. "" He said, faking a cheery voice which was no way convincing and definitely didn't require a genius to look through that 

"" Lestrade"" John growled, activating his doctor voice, the one he always used when his patient was worrying too much about their pride and not being honest about their conditions and life habits, which was too many times to count, not even mentioning the times he had to use it force Sherlock to eat or else he would faint right after solving the case and you can guess who had the honor of carrying the world's biggest overgrown toddle back to the flat. 

"" oKay - Lesstrade finally fessed up - no, I haven't been fine. It's like all the crime imaginable just started to rise up the bloody damn roof after Sherlock's death . Don't even get me to mention the pricking damn scandals his death has caused, the yard is having a bad reputation for it and several officers have been put off duty due to bad conduct , which leave the remaining ones, including me to deal with all of this shit. And my record these day has been shut and Dearest god everything is so damn shitty with everything. The cases, the scandals, the news, the paparazzi * shudder* "" By the time Lestrade had finally finished, he was out of breath and was breathing heavily like a one of those genetically bred to be insanely cute but also ended up with breathing problems flat faced cats. 

John didn't know how to deal with this subject so all he could do was offering some condolences to his friend. 

"" I am so sorry for that, Lestrade. The news of Sherlock being a fake has really affected you badly, eh"" John nearly choked when he reached the Sherlock being a fake part. There was no ways scientifically or realistically that Sherlock was a fake. It angered him to see people think so lowly of his best friend.Sure he had a lot of shortcomings,. Sure he was , most of the times, an arrogant git who claimed to be above all emotions , But he was a brilliant man, who hadn't done anything intentionally bad in my life and he did care in his own way. Like the way he would always looked out for Mrs Hudson. 

After the fall, he began to despise Anderson and Donovan even more, knowing that they too had had a part to play in his dear friend's suicide. Sure they were just pawns in the sick psychopath 's demented game of chess but they were willing pawns so John's resentment towards them was, in a way ,justified. But he wasn't going to act out on his anger. From what he learnt, doing that always seemed to bite him back in the arse. And he had already had enough baggage to deal with, thank you very much 

"" Yeah"" Mustered Lestrade as he took another gulp of coffee, to which John internally cringed 

' How do the Yard even stomach that? '

"" Anyway I will lead to the crime scene, unlike others, this one is out in the open for all to see so we had to make sure no civilians will get close to it, especially children, They will be traumatized "" 

Lestrade said, gesturing for John to follow 

The crime scene was, as Lestrade had said, out in the damn open for all to see. Three people, one woman and two men, were found dead in their puddles of blood. The scene was discovered by a elderly woman who were walking her dog in the early hours. 


oh poor her 


"" Well pretty brutal. Any comment, mate? ""

John crouched down to the cadavers, examining one of the men first. Wearing the gloves the Yard had provided, he slowly lifted the head up, careful as not to disturb any other part of the body. The body had started to enter the stage of rigor mortis but not completely so the death could have occured only around 4 to 5 hours prior. He did the same to the other two, and found the exact same result , through the woman's cause of death was hard to determine as she had bruises, stab wounds , head injuries and also marks of strangulation around her neck. The woman was dressed rather lavishly, but the old age of her clothes told John that she was nowhere near wealthy, this couldn't be a case of robbery as their wallets were all there, through none of them had their IDs unfortunately . 

"" Well, the death of the two blokes were most likely caused by the stab wounds,made  antemorterm . The woman ,on the other hand , is hard to determine as she has so many injuries of various kinds . This doesn't seem like a case of burglary as their wallets are still there and the woman 's jewellery is still on her.

' Though I don't think they would be much in value as they look fake '

"" Honestly Lestrade this seems like a case caused by violent impulses more than anything, "" 

"" I see "" Lestrade responded almost disappointedly. John felt bad that he couldn't be more helpful. 

"" I guess we- 

Lestrade's speech was cut off by the sight of another person who was definitely not one of his team staring at the corpses at the pavement. 

' A KID???? ' Lestrade internally screamed 

The kid was starting at the corpses almost in a trance. 

Feeling worried that the kid had just been traumatized, he rushed to pull the kid away from the crime scene to both preserve the scene and the poor child's innocence. Dragging the kid to where he and John were, he held the kid in place, hand firmly on both of his shoulders, already to give out a shock blanket. 

' How did a kid even get in here ? ' he wondered, hadn't his team already blocked out this area to outsiders ? 

"" Kid, are you okay.? "" He asked in a concerned manner, shaking the kid in an attempt to get him out of his presumed shock-induced trance

Surprisingly, the kid looked almost unfazed. He just stared keenly at Lestrade 

"" I'm just fine, Mr Policeman "" He started, almost too calm for a kid his age, glancing again at the slaughter in front of him, taking in all the details. 

"" I was just wondering if it was possible that the culprits were among the dead bodies over there "" He continues, pointing at the scene. 

"" What? "" Lestrade and John started, looking at the kid like he had just grown a third arm and a second head 

"" Well, I'm sorry for overhearing what the two of you were discussing earlier, Mr Policeman. But you said that nothing of value was stolen so burglary is out of questions. I think this would be what they call a crime of passion. Judging by the lady's lavish yet quite obviously old and worn clothes, we can see that she wasn't quite wealthy but liked to keep up the appearance that she was. Her death could have been caused by many things but I think strangulation is out of the way as the mark is not very deep in colour so maybe she got it while doing bedroom wrestling, judging by some of the light and nearly healed bruises on her waist. "" He proved his point by directing the two adults' eyes on the lady's waist and sure to his words, there were some bruises there but they were most definitely not made during the struggle. 

"" Which made me think that perhaps this was just a murder out of sheer jealousy. Maybe she was leading two guys on and one night while she was with one of her sweethearts, they bumped into the other and a jealousy fit ensured, ending with all of them dead. There were some traces of skins and blood on both men's fingernails , Mister. I think if you get it examined, it may shine some light on this "" 

For a moment, it was like the whole world had collapsed, that reality was no more than an illusion. 

The silence seemed to put the kid in a uncomfortable situation. Clutching his bag, he looked up in worry 

"" I d-didn't offend you, did I, mister? I am so sorry "" He said in a frantic voice

Being the first to regain his grasp on reality, John shook his head and smiled at the small kid in front of him 

"" Oh no - little lad, this theory of your is brilliant but how can you be so sure? "" 

Beaming at the accident compliment and further inquiries on his theory, the boy cheerfully continued, forgetting the anxiety he felt earlier. 

"" Oh, I found something near the alley there "" He pointed to the alley nearest to where the bodies were discovered, which wasn't even ten meters away and tugged at John's sleeve to guide him to the place. And guess what they found there, near the alley entrance , a switch blade and a knife, all covered in dried blood. 

Still smiling, the boy continued in a gleeful  manner 

"" I found them and thought that the murderer couldn't have possibly be dumb enough to dispose of the weapons here and why would they need two weapons anyway. So I came to the conclusion that the two weapons were used by two different people and were left here quite recently , seeing how new they are. The lady and one of men 's stab wounds were much wider and gappier than the other man's so I thought that the lady and the man were attacked by the other man with the knife, the lady was the first to go down and then the man pulled out his switch blade, which he must likely carries for self defense and started to defend himself, unfortunately both of them died in the process. And maybe during the struggle, their weapons got knocked out of their hands and flew into the alley.And for the lady , obviously she died due tothe loss of the blood and one of the wounds was over her lung so it wouldn't be a sketch to conclude that her lung got puncturee and she couldn't screamed for help "" The boy rambled like a mad man 

After he was done, both John and Lestrade were flabbergasted . Did a kid just solve a case for the Yard? 

' How the hell did the Yard not check the vicinity for the murder weapon? ' John thought, now realising that maybe Sherlock was right about how most of the Yard was incompetent. 

"" Wel- well thank you for your help and enthusiasm,lad. But where are your parents? "" John asked, almost too eager to meet the parents of this great child and give them a pat on the back for being able to create a kid like this, although he would give them advice on how maybe some teaching social norms would be beneficial. After all, the kid probably gave Lestrade a damn heart attack, if his face was any indicator. 

"" Lestrade, close your mouth, you are trying to catch flies, mate ? "" To which Lestrade did, but that didn't mean that he was over the shock. Turning back the boy, John cocked his head and repeated his question, this time more friendly, even crouching down to make him seem smaller and less intimidating to the young lad. 

"" I don't have one anymore "" The voice was so innocent and matter-of-fact that it took John a few moments to register it and gave meaning to the sentence. 

As though understanding the two men's confusion, the boy elaborated further 

"" Mother left me, I was going to head to the police station and then I saw you and curiosity kinda took over "" He said, somewhat embarrassed . 

"" Okay then"" Began Lestrade"" Will you give us some time please, lad "" And he pulled John aside, leaving the boy to wait.

"" I think we have a lost child situation "" Both men started at the same time 

"" And John don't you think this kid looks familiar to a certain someone? "" 

"" What do you mean, Lestrade? "" 

"" Uh, nevermind. We need to get back to the Yard to file up the report and examine the blood on the weapons ""

"" And the skin under the fingernails"" 

"" Yes that too "" 

 

 

 

 

"" And about the kid? We can't leave him here "" 

"" Well of course,we need to get him to the Yard and we will figure it from there. We try to find his relatives, if it's unsuccessful he would need a place to stay,although I don't think many of the yarders would want to let him stay with them for the night. A great deal of us don't have even a decent flat . Lost child cases have never been common here "" 

Finishing their conversation, the two men walked back to where the kid , who was now staring at the other police officers collecting evidence, was at. 

"" Kid, can you come with us to the Yard ? "" Lestrade asked, well it was more an order than a request. 

"" The yard? "" 

"" New Scotland Yard, it's where us officers hang out and file paperwork when we don't have to running around chasing criminals"" 

"" Okay, but can I sit near the window, Mr Policeman sir? "" 

"" Sure, kid and call me Lestrade "" 

The trip back the Yard was rather uneventful, aside from the unexpected kid sitting near the window, nothing was out of the ordinary. As John and the boy sat at the back, Lestrade was trying hard to focus on the road ahead of him but occasionally would glance at the kid. 

' Why does this boy look so similar? ' he ponder. An explanation hit him right in the head but he quickly shook it off 

' No, it's impossible, but then again considering his history. Is it really impossible?  I need to make sure ' 


At the yard 


While Lestrade was busy with getting the report and examination of the evidence done, John was left with the task of babysitting a kid. Not that he was complaining though. The kid had been quite well-behaved, just sitting beside him reading a document that John had given him to entertain himself. 

Remembering what Lestrade had said earlier, John took a good look at the kid. He looked strikingly similar to Sherlock, only that this little guy was blond , his face was rounder and with a smaller nose decorated with a few freckles. He looked like what Sherlock's kid would look like if Sherlock had had any interest in reproducing to continue the Holmes linage. But that was unlikely  ,this is Sherlock "" I'm married to my work "" Holmes. Even thinking about the possibility that Sherlock might have a secret love child was ridiculous , even for John. Whatever woman that managed to get him on deserved a standing ovulation  but then again seducing a corpse buried six feet underground is a bit far-fetch, hell even when said corpse had been alive , the idea was still too ludicrous . 

So caught up in his thought , John didn't even notice the two little eyes that was eyeing at him for the last two minutes during which conspiracy theories were being concocted in his head. 

Snapping back to reality, he found two blue-green eyes staring at him. 

"" Your eyes are pretty ,Mister "" The boy exclaimed gleeful, with a wide smile. 

"" W-what? "" He could only muster  usually no one paid any attention to his eyes, or him in general. He was as plain as vanilla ice cream.Usually it had been his arrogant detective that had caught everyone's attention,   whether enamored by his aloof beauty or frustrated by his sharp tongue and even sharper attitude, hell ,in many cases it had been both. 

"" Central heterochromia , I read about it on the Net when Mother was gone. It is condition where the centre of one's iris has a different colouring compared to the border, due to the uneven distribution of uh- what did they call it again - 

The boy put his hand to his chin, almost into a thinking position. John chuckled, contrasting sharply to the calm and almost unsettling impression he had had on John earlier, the being sitting next to him now was just a kid, no less than thirteen, eager to share what he learnt to anyone willing to listen. John almost couldn't believe this was the same one that nearly gave him and Lestrade a heart attack when he showed up at the crime scene  ,almost like a phantom. He almost thought he was in the movie The Shining. 

"" M-me-melanin, yes, it is caused by the uneven distribution of melanin, causing the eyes to have different color within themselves. I have never seen them in real life, aside from my own ."" Pointing at his own eyes,which were a mix of blue and green, depending on the light,with a sense of pride like any child would when discovering something unique about themselves.

"" Yours have a ring of gold shade around the irises. They are so cool"" The boy finished with a gesture at his own iris to empathize his point. 

John questioned how it was possible that anyone would abandon a bright child like this to fend for himself . People could be so cruel , even to their own kin

"" Y-yeah  I guess they are. Say, what's your name  little lad  ?"" 

' Might as well get to know him better ' he thought fondly 

Almost in a instant, the boy replied

"" My name is Arthur Miller , Sir "" 

Seeing a child so happy at a chance to talk with someone really tugged at his heartstrings  ,John always had a soft spot for children. They were , at their core,  innocent like a white sheet , whether the sheet would be painted with bright colours or drenched in black ink and then stomped is unclear. In the latter situation, there was a chance the cycle would continue 


Hurt people hurt people


He hoped Arthur wouldn't become like that. No children deserve to suffer at the hands of anyone , less so their parents 

"" Well Arthur, I am John Watson, you can call me John .Mind telling me something about yourself? Like age or whatnot ?"" 

' Yeah that is a good enough conversation starter '

"" Well I am eleven year and 4 months old, Mr John


' So young '


-. There is not much about me "" 

The kid was beginning to tense up. John had seen this more than enough. More often than not, when he was examining children or asking them about how things had been recently  they often had a hard time answering, whether it was because of interrupting parents always putting words in their children's mouths or just general anxiety a kid would have when facing an adult . Fortunately  he knew how to handle situations like this. 

"" Well let's start out small. Where are you from? "" John reassured. When faces with such a broad question, some kids can be a bit tensed so it's best to start out small with casual question to create a familiar atmosphere first. And asking where the kid was from would give them  ,at the very least , an idea on how Arthur's home life was. This was very essential. 

"" I was born here sir, in London, have been here all my life "" 

"" And what do you usually do in your free time ? ""

"" Not much, when I get bored, I try to keep myself entertained,reading books from the library, researching things on the Internet. I tried to keep quiet so Mother wouldn't get cranky "" The last part was said in a lower, but quieter voice ,which made John's face drop but he quickly put it back on as not to distress Arthur even more. 

"" What about you , Mr John? "" 

"" Well, I usually just go about my day . Reading books is also an interest of mine, though nowadays I don't really have much time . ""

' Since these days I have been too busy mourning my flatmate and been going insane from the bloody hallucinations ' that part was left out for obvious reason

"" Is it really true that being a doctor is hard,  Mr John? "" 

The question caught John off guard a bit 

"" Well it depends. And how did you know I am a doctor "" 

Arthur tilted his head a bit to the right

"" You have the smell of medicine but not the kind that used to preserve cadaver but rather the type used to treat common illnesses like headache, indigestion,... The tone you use reminds me of how some doctors try to cheer up children before an injection. Also there is a chemical stain on your jumper. It smells like disinfectant used in hospitals "" 

At this point, John didn't know if whether to laugh or to cry.He could only managed a choked chuckle .The kid was like Mini Sherlock, only more polite and definitely less walls built around him. 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

"" That was amazing. Brilliant even. You're a bright kid "" John said, suddenly remembering his and Sherlock's first meeting. Those were the good old days.Hearing the compliment, Arthur's eyes lit up like fireflies in the dark, a smile beaming on his face, making him look more like a kid his age rather than the kids with the unblinking eyes that came straight out of horror movies. 

Seeing the kid up close now, John noticed how weird his clothes were,an old t- shirt clearly meant for thirteen-year-olds and above , an equally worn pair of brown trousers, topped with a pair of brown shoes and a knitted cardigan, all of which looked a bit oversized for the boy and frankly speaking, they all looked so worn , with some of the colour already starting to fade from his beige T-shirt. All of that made him look so small, couple with the fact that he was a tad bit thin for a boy his height. 

John felt his fist tighten. 

' What kind of parents would abandon their children? Why did these people even have kids in the first place? Could they have bloody bothered to put a damn rubber on or maybe pull out in time or better yet have birth control on hand? At the very least take responsibility for what you did ' .

So many anger-fueled thought were filling John's mind . He should be desensitized with this by now. Back in Afghanistan, it was not uncommon to find dead mangled, even blown up corpses of innocent children. Sometimes, you would be hanging around in a village, chatting with the locals, giving the kids there piggy back rides, making small talks and then BAM the little lads you were just playing with were now dead, gone. They had had their lives taken away at a young age, most had their eyes wide open and their faces twisted into an expression of fear and pain. When this happened, you just had to suck it up and grab the nearest thing to make a make-shift weapon and head straight to battle, sometimes even stomping on the exposed guts or brain matter of some innocent villagers. It was quite literally bloody hell.

No matter how hard he tried, John couldn't get the images  of those children's faces out of his face , twisted in pain and their body mangled beyond recognition, with guts oozing out like spaghetti and organs littered near the place they died.

By and large, John should be unfazed by this and yet here he was, worrying about an unknown kid ( who looked suspiciously like his deceased flatmate, who he may or may not have seen as more than a friend. Had it not been for his sandy blond hair and round small nose , the yard would be swearing up and down that he is Sherlock's kid.Like just put a black wig on him and the whole yard would think there is a secret love child of Sherlock walking around in plain sight and surprisingly not deducing and insulting people simultaneously) and getting all riled up about the possibility of said kid being mistreated. 

"" Mr John"" The voice bought him back to reality 

"" D-did I offend you? "" Arthur asked with worry in his voice 

"" Uh yeah, I am fine , just got lost in Memory Lane, nothing important, lad. So anything you want to ask about me, lad? I take it that the conservation have been a bit one-sided so we might as well mix things up "" 

"" Well I do want to ask something  , Mr John. How come that curly- haired lady over there keeps staring at us? "" 

Okay that was not a question John was expecting 

Looking towards the direction Arthur was pointing, John quickly located the mentioned being, which was. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Donovan. 

' Great ' John thought unenthusiastically

As if noticing that John and Arthur were staring back at her stalking arse, Donovan cautiously approached. 

"" Lestrade needs you "" She said bluntly

John merely gave a hum in response , stood up and gestured Arthur to follow him. 

Just as they were entering Lestrade's office, a distinct sneer came from Donovan 

"" Didn't know Freak had a child? "" 

It took John all of his restraint as a soldier and his good conscience not to turn around and verbally assault Donovan. The urge was tempting but he knew nothing good would come out of this and God's sake there was a child here. 

Entering his friend's office, they were instantly instructed by Lestrade to have a seat , which they did. 

"" Okay lad, I will just ask ya a few questions okay? "" Started Lestrade, already with note in hands

Gaining a nod from the young boy, he began . 

"" What 's your name? "" 

"" Arthur Miller, sir "" 

"" Age? ""

"" Eleven ""

"" What school do you go to? "" 

"" Chester middle school, sir "" 

"" What grade are you in? "" 

"" I will be starting Year 7 after summer ""

And so on, so forth, questions were answered. Personally to John, the process was too mechanical and bleak, not to mention too much pressure being forced on a kid. He could tell that Arthur wasn't feeling too comfortable being interrogated like a suspect of a triple homicide. 

Fortunately, the interrogation was short . 

"" Well, that's enough for now. Thank you, lad "" Lestrade said, reaching into the nearby bowl of candies , grabbing a few pieces and gave them to Arthur who accepted them, though the look on his face indicated that he didn't like the lemon-chocolate favoured hard sweet that he received. 

"" John, can I have a few words with you, mate "" Lestrade said and pulled John outside, leaving Arthur who was looking at the sweet with a disgusted look, which was understandable, I mean who even had the idea to combine lemon and chocolate as a candy favour. 

"" What is it, Lestrade? "" John inquired, a bit done with being pulled aside to have a private conversation twice this day. 

"" Well, remember how I said that if we can't find the kid's relatives, he has to stay at someone's place for a night or two and how I said most of the yarders can't let him stay with them. "" 

"" Wait - you don't mean ""

"" Yes ""

""Lestrade, I am not even part of the police. How can I? Why can't you do it? "" 

"" John, please, I know this is all too sudden for you, well, us but you're basically the only one I can trust on this. To be frank, I don't trust most of the officers here and the ones I do, I doubt, they have the space and time to look after a child. And we can't leave him  "" 

Much as he hated to admit this, but Lestrade was right. Leaving Arthur here was a no no and John didn't think that he could trust the yarders with the kid seeing how Lestrade remarked that they had never had this type of case before. Normally lost children got reunited with their families within hours of arrival, but what can you do when said child's family didn't want him. 

And it's not like John couldn't handle a kid for a few days, sure he needed to work but the kid seemed to be able to look after himself for a few hours. But John feared that he may have a breakdown while at the flat and scare the kid away. The last thing he wanted was to be seen as a lunatic by a child. 

After a good while battling his turmoil, his inner goodness and inability to watch a child be left alone won out. 

"" Fine, I 'll do it "" John said, letting out a sigh

"" And for the love of God and everything holy Lestrade, rest for bloody hell's sake, mate. You look like utter shit"" 

After John left with Arthur, Lestrade took a sip from his cup of coffee. 

' Taste awful but it does it's job ' he thought and then rummaged through his trousers' pocket to pull out his phone, dialing a series of number 

"" Hey Myc, yeah I know, miss you too, I need a favour, something surreal happened today... 

If you told John a few hours earlier that he would be taking care of kid for the next few days, he would have laughed it off as a bad joke and yet here he was at the entrance to the building where his flat resided, with a eleven-year-old child. 

"" What am I going to tell Mr Hudson? "" He whispered to himself 

 

I can't bloody believe that I have made it this far. Thank you beautiful darlings so much

Arriving at Baker Street, John fumbled to get his keys. Holding onto Arthur's hand to guide him the way to his temporary home. The boy looked around the building, eye changing director like the spin of a helicopter to take in the new surroundings. 

"" It's okay Arthur, you will be safe here. No one in this building bites, well there may be a few noise now and again but nothing too much "" John reassured the small child beside him, who seemed to still be on edge despite his reassurance. This was reasonable, John remembered how shy and nervous he had been as a child, especially when in a presence of a new environment. The sense of the unknown had always gave him anxiety. 

Opening the door to the flat, John guided Arthur inside, looking at the oh-so familiar place, yet it wasn't the same without the world's only consulting detective. And somehow this was made even intense with the appearance of a small being that looked  so similar to Sherlock

' Funny how human genetics work' John thought as he rubbed his shoes against the doormat, removing all the dirt and filth, before placing them in their rightful place. 

Seeing this, Arthur seemed a bit confused but decided to mimick John nonetheless , first getting rid of the filth and then setting his shoes next to John's. 

"" Well"" John started in an attempt to break the awkward silence between them 

"" You want a cup of tea, lad? Or juice? "" Said John as he reached into the fridge to find the bottle of orange juice he had bought a few days earlier. Since now there weren't any organs or heads, of any species, lying around in the fridge, John was able to easily locate the bottle of orange juice. 

"" Tea, please Mr John "" Arthur  replied""  Can I sit here please? "" , pointing at one of the chairs in the living room, John's chair to be specific. 

"" Yeah sure, go ahead, Arthur."" 

Hopping on the chair, Arthur tried to make himself comfortable. All the walking had made his legs a bit tired , but that didn't mean that his mind was. Far from it, his mind was spinning around, taking in the details of the flat, connecting the clues to better understand his new environment and his new supposed caretaker. 

Despite still having some uncertainty towards John, he didn't think he would be much of a threat. To be honest, he thought John was friendly and nice to him, maybe even more than his Mother had been to him, even if he was dangerous, Arthur wouldn't need to worry, he had already mapped out an escape route and the pocket knife he had in his cardigan would come in useful. He may not be able to defeat an adult but with his small size, he could inflict some damage to his legs and then make an escape. 

' Of course, I am not going to do anything to harm Mr John, after all he seems nice ' but Arthur knew people can be deceptive so he had to be careful. 

' Better safe than sorry '

While John was waiting for the water in the kettle to boil in the kitchen, Arthur looked around the flat. 

' Seem spacious for a man to be living alone. Maybe Mr John has a flatmate or maybe a wife ' 

Moving his head around, Arthur looked up and noticed the room upstairs had had its door slightly open, enough to reveal that it was a bedroom. Lowering his head , he noticed the door to one of the rooms on the floor he was on was locked. 

Getting up and carefully stepping to peer through the keyhole, he could barely make out the outline of a bed in the dark

' So a flatmate then '

Quickly returning to the chair, Arthur sat down, pretending to have nothing to do. A minute later, John returned with two cups of tea in hands. 

"" Milk and sugar, lad? ""

"" Yes, please Mr John"" 

Nodding his head, John added a little milk and sugar to Arthur's cup 

"" You know that you don't have to call me Mr all the time, right? "" 

Arthur seemed confused before opening his mouth once again

"" Isn't calling someone significantly older than you Mr or Miss a polite gesture? "" He asked, scratching his head, ruffling his hand through his curly blond hair. He liked his hair colour, it wasn't like Mother's and from what he had heard from Mother about Father, it was the same case with him. Arthur felt a sense of relief, as ridiculous as it was, that he was , at least, different from his parents in that aspect. He couldn't have imagined turning into a junkie like his parents.He had already had enough defects from being a drug baby. He didn't need more. 

"" Well yes, but sometimes it can be a bit too formal "" John replied. Arthur liked the way he didn't treat him like a little kid unable to have a single coherent thought or worse, a pest or a mistake. He hoped that there weren't some deceptions involved . It would be a pity if there were 

"" But I want to show respect "" Arthur replied , slightly pouting . He always felt uncomfortable referring to people older than him without stating Mr or Miss or Mrs. It showed respect and a level of unfamiliarity, which was perfect. 

"" Alright, lad "" John chuckled, settling a cup of tea in front of Arthur. It smelled nice, unlike the bitter solution he had made with the cheap tea packets he had found at home. 

Lifting the cup to his nose, Arthur inhaled a lungful of tea, feeling a bit relaxed thanks to the calming smell of tea. From what he had learnt, tea has a calming effect on the nerves but when he tried to make it, the taste was so horrendous that he had to spit it out. That was probably due to the cheap and probably expired quality of the tea packets, plus his limited knowledge on how to make tea. 

' I need to learn more on this ' Arthur thought to himself. ' It doesn't smell drugged ' he thought as he took another whip of the tea . Taking a small sip, it tasted good, very aromatic and didn't taste funny. 

' Then again why would Mr John try to drug me? He seems respectable. Though I have heard that human trafficking can earn one a lot of money but again he doesn't look like the type of scum to do that. He actually seems a little sad , if his aura and the slump on his shoulder when he walks are anything to go by. Perhaps he has lost a loved one ' Thought Arthur as he drank the rest of the delicious tea. 

"" It's delicious, Mr John"" Complimented Arthur as he set his cup down. 

John let out a small smile, it was nice to be able to smile genuinely after months of possible insanity caused by his hallucinations and his thoughts. 

"" Thanks "" He said hesitantly 

"" No really, Mr John. It's better than what Mother made. Despite being so proud of being full British, she is never able to make a decent cup of tea or even cook"" 

John felt as if he was about to choke. The kid in front of him was talking about his less than ideal home life like it was nothing, which made him wonder what kind of shit Arthur had gone through to be so... unfazed. But he wasn't going to pity him. Sometimes pity can make a person feel even  worse than they already have. He could say that from experience. If anything , he admired the kid for being so strong. Not to mention how aware of the situation the kid was. Not many kids know where to head to when they are abandoned by their family. 

"" Y-your mother was not a nice lady  , eh? "" 

At least he could offer an ear to listen to the other's problems. An sympathetic ear can make one feel better by being able to let out their frustration. 

"" No, I mean she used to be but she got messed up. She used to care about me but not anymore. All about her boyfriend and "" Happy pills "" . 

' Stopping rambling, you idiot. You're over sharing ' The voice in his head shouted but his mouth just kept going. 

"" I hate her, I don't want to see her ever again. I WISH SHE WAS DEAD "" As soon as the words were out, Arthur covered his mouth. 

John looked so shocked, his eyes wide and mouth slightly agape. 

' Shit, he's going to get angry ' The irrational fight or flight response of Arthur was going into overdrive. Why did he have to share that unnecessary detail. 

' Oh god, he is going to think I'm a psycho, a demented freak. Why mouth? WHY CAN'T YOU SHUT UP FOR ONCE ? ' 

Arthur started shaking, held his hands to his face, ready to cry out a string "" I'm sorry- I'm sorry -I'm sorry "" over and over. 

Instead of shouts or hit that he was expecting to receive whenever he dared overstep his boundaries, John gently parted Arthur's hands from his face, which were clawing at his face so hard that blood was threatening to leak out. 

Seeing the bright kid who had been smiling at him so preciously a hour ago curling up in a ball , begging like he was going to be beat up and mostly likely having a full on panic attack, it made John feel even more angry about the kid's situation, he didn't do anything wrong and yet was abandoned by his family. Oh how he wanted to give his mother a piece of his mind, he wouldn't even hold back on the swearing. This was full on child neglect and abuse. John felt horrified and furious how people can do this to their kin, their kid nonetheless.

It's like they were less than an animal.Sure there are some animals that would kill or abandon their young if stressed or endangered but human were above that, they developed morals, sympathy. That's probably why they are so advanced compared to the rest of the Animals Kingdom. 

Finally succeeding in keeping the kid from literally clawing his face away, John quietly sat beside the kid

"" It's okay, I won't hurt you, you are safe. Keep breathing. Yeah that's good. Breathe in, breathe out, you're doing great  "" He reassured the little soul that he was safe, no one was hurting. It's what John wished people would do for him whenever he had war flashbacks, but after an accident where his colleagues had been too scared or disgusted to even approach and just acted like nothing happened afterwards, John decided it was better to deal with this in solitude. 

Slowly pulling Arthur into a hug, John gently pat his back, rubbing small circles on its middle to calm the young kid down. Despite the initial flinches, Arthur gradually sunk into the hug, his breathing slowly calming down till it was at a normal rate. After a while sitting still, the young boy's voice broke the silence. 

"" W-why aren't you mad ?"" He croaked, his voice all hoarse and dry from all the crying. 

And seeing this just broke John's heart, he knew the world was a cruel place, and sometimes it's the innocent ones that suffer, not the bloody tossers that always prey on the weak. Looking at the boy's scared, tear stained freckled face, somehow John saw his child self and many other children who suffered from mistreatment. He understood the helplessness and irrational thinking progress that everything was about to get them, harm them, torture them. It wasn't death that they most feared, but rather the long and likely painful way it would be delivered . 

Struggling to push through the painful sensation at the depth of his stomach, John began to open his mouth, ever so gently and carefully, in order not to distress the boy even more. Panic attack is a terrible, irrational thing, it 's a caged, scared animal, ready to lash out and attack or run away from any hands that approach it, be it a amiable or a malicious one. 

"" No, Arthur, I am not mad. Like I said earlier, you're safe, I won't hurt you"" His words, soft and steady, really had a calming effect on the young boy, or at the very least, had stopped him from falling deeper into the panic attack and risking hurting himself. That was the last thing John wanted. 

Still hugging, Arthur clinged to John more, almost like this was the first hug he had ever received, which was true, as least from what the young boy was able to remember. Mother's hugs were never for him, they were always for her string of boyfriends whom she would bring home and have bedroom wrestling or do happy pills. That were what she had told him to keep him oblivious but Arthur wasn't stupid, at least he hoped so, praying that whatever damn drugs his Mother had put into her body while carrying him hadn't affected his mental development . The thought of being mentally underdeveloped had Arthur sick to his stomach. He , definitely sure as damn bloody gutted hell itself, didn't want to be one of those drooling, brainless kids unaware of the world around them. In some fortunate cases, people would just take pity on them, some less unfortunate ones , however, those kids would be perfect target for child trafficking , which either resulted in them being labour slaves or sex slaves. Or get their organs ripped out and sold on the black market. 

' It's a miracle that Mother didn't abandon or kill me sooner. Good grace, what am I doing? Being a damn weakling, who breaks down at the slightest sign of misinterpreted danger. How can I survive being so weak? ' 

So caught up in his thought was the boy that he didn't notice that John had let go of the hug, leaving Arthur to start to cling to his own limbs. Pouring a new cup of tea, John held the cup up to Arthur, who was starting to tear up again.

"" Here, drink up, Arthur. You need to replenish fluid "" John said, knowing fully well that it was a lie just to get Arthur to drink the tea. It was a trick John had accidentally stumbled upon during one of his times researching as a med student. It is said by researchers that evolutionary psychology dictates that humans only drink or eat when they feel safe, whether it is about the things they are consuming or their surroundings. By making people have a drink or eat something when in distress, it can help trick the brain into thinking everything's okay, which can help a long way when one's brain is always screaming that you're in danger. 

John may not be as intelligent as Sherlock but he still knew many useful knowledge to aid him through his life, whether it was about being a soldier or a doctor. It's amazing how his medical knowledge could come in so handy when being a army doctor during his tours. Guess it's quite easy to defeat an opponent when you already know what a human's typical weak points. Sometimes it stunned John how a human body can be so fragile in some situations and resilient in others. 

Staring at the cup of tea, Arthur accepted with hesitation, his hands still a bit shaky, eyeing John almost in disbelief, his facial expression similar to the one John himself had made when this brilliant child had managed to speculate a possible story behind a case, while the Yard hadn't even bothered to check the vicinity for the blooming murder weapon. 

As the young boy slowly drank the tea, John noticed his sniffling had stopped, so had his hiccups. After having drunk the tea, Arthur lowered tea cup, which John carefully retrieved  and placed it on the table , before pulling out handkerchief to wipe the tears from the boy's face. While doing so, he couldn't help but think that the boy was so like Sherlock and at the same time wasn't. The boy was bright and clearly had a bit of deduction skills, yet he didn't seem - how should John put it - so aloof, so emotionally constipated, which was good because as much as John admired Sherlock, he really didn't approve of the late consulting detective's way of dealing with emotions. 

"" W-why? "" The boy started, a expression of disbelief and confusion plastered on his freckled face. 

John only managed an equally confused ""uh? ""

"" I don't understand Mr John. Why are you so kind to me? "" 

At that moment, John wondered what kind of hell had Arthur gone through to make him believe that he was undeserving of kindness. John hoped he wouldn't meet the kid's mother or else there would be another kill hanging over his head. 

Clearing his throat, he responded. 

"" Because you deserve it, Arthur ""

A simple response but enough to convey the meaning

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

After comforting the young boy for a good half an hour, just reassuring and telling him he was worthy of being treated with kindness just like any other beings. 

That is, until a noise startled them both,it seemed that Arthur was getting hungry, if the growling of his stomach was any sign. 

"" Want something to eat, lad? "" John asked, although he was pretty sure he already knew the answer. It was getting late, around 8pm and he was sure that Arthur wasn't eating well, given how thin he looked, especially with those clothes that were simply a tad too big for someone his frame. John decided the best action now was to get him fed and make him more comfortable for the time being. 

"" Y-yes, please "" Arthur muttered, a slight blush on his face as the embarrassment seeped in, clutching his stomach. 

Going to the fridge, John pulled out some eggs, cream , tomatoes and leafy green before reaching up to the cupboard to get the dried pasta and some herbs and seasonings. 

"" Is pasta okay for you, Arthur? "" John asked, to which Arthur just nodded, still a bit embarrassed about earlier. Starting up the stove, John bought the pot of water to a boil , dropped the pasta and brought out a pan to make the sauce. First cream, then garlic, egg yolks for richness, chives, salt and pepper and finally a little bit of mozzarella to add texture. For the tomatoes, he simply grilled them to get them caramelized , thus more juicy and easier to eat. 

"" You're really good at cooking, Mr John "" Arthur commented, standing near where John was finishing the sauce and draining the pasta. 

John jerked up a bit, wondering how had he managed to move so quietly. Maybe that was how he had sneaked through the yarders at the crime scene, either that or the New Scotland Yard officers were more incompetent than John gave them credit for. He hoped it was the former rather than the latter

' Honestly, this is impressive ' John mentally remarked, in his mind he was already forming theories on why Arthur moved so quietly

' He did mention that his mother gets cranky easily . Could it be -' thought John before shoving those ideas to the back of mind, where they sat along side his complicated feelings for the late detective, although some curiosity still managed to resurface. 

'Now it's not the time to question him, I just need to focus on getting food on the plate. He needs time to slowly open up.' Concluded John as him dumped the freshly boiled pasta into the sauce and stirred for it to cling to the pasta. While doing so, he couldn't help but wonder how the yard would handle the boy's case. If they are unable to find any relatives to take the boy in, he will go into foster care, which has like a 50-50 chance of it being better for him than his previous home. He felt his hand tremble as the imagine of Arthur going into a foster home where he is ignored, treated with indifference, only kept for the sole purpose of financial gain and good popularity. It was hard to laugh at the irony of the situation, how he had just met this boy for less than 24 hours and already cared for him, similar to how a parent would. John attributed this to his doctor nature, his need to take care of people, not to mention the subject of his worry bore a eerie likeness to the person that he used to spend time caring for, most often after cases involving fights. 

' Maybe I can take him in ' the thought appeared as abruptly as the acnes on a teenager's face. It was simple but there were too much things to consider. How can John, a single man living alone,be deemed as better for the job of taking care of a kid than ,said , a couple consisting of two people. Not to mention taking care of a child means making sacrifices. What if the boy grows to resent him. 

After a while lingering at that thought, John's mind decided to advance the ante and had him wondering about the boy's origin. 

' He has only mentioned his mother and not his father. Maybe he is absent. If so where and who can he be? '

A speculation popped into his mind but John quickly swatted it away like one would normally do to a fly, quick and forceful. It was silly and blatantly ridiculous to even consider that idea as no way would someone as married to his work as Sherlock would ever have had the desire to do it. Even if he had, not like Sherlock would be heartless enough to do something like this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, ? 

' No , he wouldn't. Sure the wanker had his own shortcomings and "" high-functioning sociopath "" status but he wouldn't be cruel enough to.. ' the thought was cut short by the smell of the dish being done. 

' Dear god, I am going insane '

Turning off the stove, John divided the dish onto two plates. If  in the near future his most terrible and abhorrent speculation is proven to be true , then John really needs to reevaluate how good he is at choosing candidates on whom he places his trust. But that was another matter for another day, right now his only concern was to make sure his little guest feel welcome. 

"" Food's ready, lad. - John said as he set the two plates on the table , before realizing he had forgotten to retrieve the utensils and turning to Arthur- Could you be so kind as to grab the utensils near the sink, Arthur "" 

To which, the boy quickly obliged, running to the sink to get the utensils and returning back to the table before giving them to John who organized them beside each plate of pasta. 

"" Well dig in, Arthur. ""

The rest of the dinner was a bit weird to John, mainly because he hadn't eaten with someone for months now, so he was a bit unsure about how he looked while eating, though he soon realized he didn't have to worry much as his company was only a kid, so no need for any too proper table manner. 

"" It's delicious, Mr John. You're a really good cook "" Said Arthur, who was devouring the pasta with much vigor. Kid ate like he hadn't eaten for days. Chuckling lightly, John pulled out a tissue to wipe the sauce that got on the boy's face. Despite the initial flinch, Arthur let him. 

"" Thanks ,Arthur ""

Despite thinking it was just an attempt to break the awkward silence, John accepted the compliment nonetheless. It's not everyday that he gets a compliment, given how plain he seems. After all, it was Sherlock who got all the attention  with his good looks, brilliant mind and equally dickish personality. Plus,it was good that Arthur was willing to talk and possibly open up more to him. In order to help the kid , he needed more information on him. 

 

After dinner and the washing up of dishes and kitchenware ( with the help of Arthur, who insisted that he help, despite John's numerous assurance that he could handle it himself) . After a minute of discussing, John gave in to the boy's insistence, deciding that this was probably his way of showing thanks. John admitted that it was endearing. 

After that, it was already 9:30 pm, which was a bit too early for him to hit the hay but he was too tired to wait another hour and Arthur, being a kid, probably needed his sleep by now, seeing how he had been yawning and rubbing his eyes for the past 10 minutes while holding his bags. 

"" Well I guess it's time to go to the bed "" John said to Arthur, who was halfway to dozing off while standing, jerk up. 

"" O-okay "" Arthur half-said, half-yawned, and started to walk towards the sofa, settling one of his bags down, before proceeding to hop on the sofa, using the other softer bag as a makeshift pillow. 

He was halfway to lying down on his back when John said 

"" What are you doing, lad? You're not sleeping here "", which seemed to startle him enough for him to sit up 

"" O-oh - his eyes looked down at the cold, hard floor - then am I going to sleep on the floor? "", his tone a bit sad but no trace of surprise could be found. It's not like he couldn't get a few shut-eyes sleeping on the floor, he had had worse. 

"" W-what- John quickly retorted to clear the misunderstanding , he looked disturbed at how Arthur came to the conclusion that just because he was told that he wasn't sleeping the sofa,he would be sleeping on the floor - You're not sleeping on the floor. J-just follow me""

Holding Arthur's small hand, John guided him to the bedroom upstairs, his bedroom. 

"" You will be sleeping here for the time being, lad. So get comfortable "" said John before walking to the closet to pull out a pillow and a spare sheet. 

"" Well you best go to bed now. The bathroom is downstairs and if you need anything, I will be downstairs too. "" With that John was out of the room. 

Staring at the decently furnished bedroom, so different from the thin dirty mattress at home that had been his ""bed"" ever since he could remember. Reaching towards the bed, he could feel the soft, bouncy material beneath his palm. 

' It feels nice and comfortable ' 

Sitting on the bed, he could feel how bouncy it was, unlike the deflated one back home. There was also no foul smell or discoloration that could make him rather sleep on the floor. Letting his body lay down on the bed complete, Arthur felt like he was dreaming , that any seconds he was going to wake up and be back at home, smelling the putrid smell of vomit, sexual intercourse and alcohol and hearing all the grotesque noise and the sight of the white mind-destroying powder and colourful pills. 

Grabbing his wrist, he pinched it hard in an attempt to "" wake up"". It had been nice, but if he were to stay in his dreamland any longer, he might end up crying for something that isn't even real when he wakes up. 

' Maybe the pain isn't enough ' thought Arthur as he bought the back of his right palm up to his mouth and bit down hard , enough to leave a slight mark but not enough for blood to leak out

Letting go and wincing at the pain, he saw that nothing had changed. He was still in a bedroom with a comfy bed and he was safe, at least for the next few days. 

' So it's real and not my wild imagination '. Lying back down on the bed, he succumbed to the softness of the material and dozed off to dreamland. 

Meanwhile, John was downstairs, pondering what kind of hellish life did Arthur go through. Remembering his expression when he had thought that he would be taking up residence on the hard and cold floor of the flat just made John want to punch the kid's parents even more. Who would even do that to a child? A monster that's for sure. 


She used to care about me but not anymore. All about her boyfriend and "" Happy pills""


'Drugs' concluded John, letting a sigh of exasperation. Oh how he despised this side of humanity. 

As a doctor, he had heard about many stories involving drug addictions of all kinds such as heroine, morphine, acid, hallucinogen, etc,.. within the medical community, but none of that compared to seeing the damage it caused for the innocent with your own eyes. Drugs, the illegal and extremely dangerous kind, can turn a kind human into a raging savage who would do anything to get their next hit to the point that that is all they care about, ignoring everyone else, even one's own children.Coming from a not so happy home life himself, John could sympathize with Arthur. The boy was strong and bright but abuse and neglect like that can affect anyone, especially children whose mind hasn't matured and so can be easily led astray. Children who grow up with drug addicted parents are said by researchers to have a high risk of committing substance abuse when older. The thought of the cycle being repeated in the future sickened John so he decided he was going to deal with that tomorrow. Right now, sleep was what he needed. 

 

 

 

Hello there, sorry for not uploading, schools in my country just started again so I am going to be a tad busy for next coming month. Apologies beforehand for the slow updates. I will make it up in length, hopefully

As the light of the sun shone through the uncovered window, Arthur groaned and rolled over. Instead of the short transition from the mattress to the floor like he had anticipated , he received a rather pain-inducing fall. 

"" Ouch what the hell ?"" He grunted, rubbing his side to ease the throbbing. At least that wasn't the only one he had. It took him a moment to clear his foggy mind and register that he wasn't at his home. 

"" Oh yeah"" He muttered, rubbing his head as he recalled the events of yesterday. To be honest, it was still a bit shocking for him that his mother would abandon him. As much as he hated his mother now, it was hard to deny that a long time ago, there had existed feelings for his mother ,other than hatred and resentment. Standing up, he reached for his bags, joyful to find that nothing was lost. Reaching into his knitted cardigan, he let out a sigh of relief that his pocket knife was still in place. 

' I wonder who thought of the idea for pocket knife. Did that person just one day think "" Hey, I want a knife that can fold into itself so that I can surprise my enemies. You think this is a piece of wood, bam a knife."" Maybe I will look into that later '

' People may think I am a deranged psycho for carrying around a knife but better have some protection than none, right? Especially in my situation ' thought Arthur as he settled the knife back into one of the pockets on the inside of his cardigan. which all seemed to be of a different material than the rest of his cardigan. They were worn pieces of scrap fabric cut and neatly sewn onto the cardigan for better holding ability , they even had  buttons used to close the pockets to ensure further that none of the contents slipped out.

' Good thing I know how to sew. I will have to admit I really outdid myself on these , thought I did pricked my fingers a great many times ' he smiled at the result of his meticulous and patient sewing while shuddering a bit from memories of the sharp pain experienced when sewing, feeling a sense of pride and like he was one step closer to proving Mother that he wasn't useless. 


 But what if you are??  


Honestly he thought it was weird how people were so adversed to carrying knives as self-defense weapon. I mean would be inconvenient for someone to accuse you of being a murderer just because you were carrying a knife. He hoped the officers wouldn't that gullible. But then again he had managed to sneak through a bunch of official police officers, all with badges and other authoritarian stuff, to get into a murder scene. Even Mr Policeman there - what was his name again - L-lestrade, yeah, even Mr Lestrade, a likely trained professional that had been working the job for years, indicated by his age ,posture and general familiarity with gore, had looked like he had just seen a ghost. Reminded of the event, Arthur couldn't help be feel proud for having been able to fool several police officers. 

Realizing that it was still early in the morning, Arthur decided to look around the room. 

' Dog tags, polished frequently, probably hold some sentimental value , so Mr John was in the military. No wonder he always walks like the soldiers in military documents' 

The though frightened Arthur a bit. Now knowing that he was in the same house with an ex-military, he needed to come up with a different strategy to fight back and escape if need be. No one knew Arthur had a knife on him so maybe he could aim at a vital organ or maybe go for the legs and slice the tendons. Humans can be so fragile if you know where to inflict damage

He knew that his thinking of ways to kill anyone that came close to him was a bit ridiculous and if not all but demented, deranged, psychotic and insane from a sane person's view.Not like he was in any potential danger, even if Mr John had wanted to hurt him, he would have done it in his sleep. And what use would he make of killing a child, especially when said child had been reported to the police about his abandonment. If Arthur were killed, his murderer wouldn't get off scot free easily. 

' Still it can't hurt to be careful ' the voice inside his head illustrated. The voice was annoying at times but it had saved his arse more than once so he didn't have much complaint about his anxiety for now. 

After all, Arthur essentially had no one to lean on. If he is going to be put into foster care, which is muchly likely, adoption, on the other hand, not so much, as few would want a child his age, too rebellious and stubborn, then he will run the risk of being used a tool for good population, a trophy that his "" caretakers"" flaunt to prove to the world how they are good-hearted beings to have the courage to take in a deranged child. 

Unfortunately, seeing how disappointing human kind can be, the public will, most likely, eat up those lies like a pack of hungry wolves spotting a juicy piece of meat. 

' Mr John has an a large amount of jumpers. He must love wearing them' Arthur commented as he spotted the arrangement of neatly folded jumpers in the closet. 

' I can't argue with that. Jumpers are comfortable and cozy, they are like hugs personified as clothes. I wish I had one '

Awakening from his restless slumber, John stretched his arms over his head and arched his back. Sleeping on the couch wasn't exactly comfortable but he still managed to get some rest, despite the minor nightmares. John was surprised that he hadn't waken up screaming like a madman during the night, which would be very awkward for him and Arthur. 

' I wonder how he is doing ' John thought as he slipped out of the sofa and walked upstairs. 

Opening the door to his bedroom, expecting to see the blond boy still sound asleep, to his surprise, Arthur wasn't asleep, in fact, he wasn't seen anywhere within John's vision. 


oh fuck


""Where the fuck is he? "" The doctor muttered, turning his head in all directions in search of the blond-headed boy, any signs of the head of curly blond locks. 

Scrambling around, lifting up the bed sheets and  pillows, opening up the closet and looking under the bed, John basically checked every nook and cranny for the boy. 

' oh bloody hellish fucking tossing shit of the motherfucking Lord of the damn above ' Cursing out every kind of profanity John had learnt during his army time, he realized that Arthur wasn't even in the room. Rushing out of the room, John was just, quite frankly, moment away from turning the flat upside down. 

' HOW THE FUCK DID I MANAGE TO LOSE A KID ?' 

Fortunately for him and quite possibly the flat , the sight of the blond curly hair came into view. 

' Oh thank god ' John let out a sigh of utter and utmost relief. That was like the second near heart attack he had had in the last 24 hours, and they were all caused by the same individual. What an accomplishment!! 

After the relief, John noticed someone was standing in front of Arthur. 

It was Mr Hudson, who frankly looked puzzled as to why there was a small child here in John's flat.

' Knew I would have to explain sooner or later ' 

Pinching the bridge of his nose, John approached to resolve the awkward and puzzling situation that was definitely causing both parties to feel very confused, although on Arthur's part it was more uncomfortable and uncertain. 

"" Hi Mrs Hudson "" John started, showing a smile to increase the chance of this going smoothly

"" I can explain "" he continued , pulling Mr Hudson aside to have a chat with her while telling Arthur to go freshen up in the loo and that he could find a spare toothbrush in a bag hanged on the door. 

After explaining Mrs Hudson the reason why Arthur was staying with him for a few days at least until they could locate any of his relatives.  He only talked about the accidentally solved a case vaguely as he didn't want another one making the comparison between Arthur and Sherlock.(*cough cough* Lestrade)His slowly going mad brain had already been doing a wonderful and fantastic job at that. 

' Honestly the kid's looks are similar enough, had not been for his hair and some facial features . Maybe I do need to go the loony house.'

"" Poor boy "" Mrs Hudson said, eyeing Arthur who was sitting on the couch, reading one of John's medical books. He was probably too absorbed by the book to notice the worried stare of Mrs Hudson, which was good. 

John only nodded in agreement with Mrs Hudson. 

I am back, my lovelies. Thank you so much for supporting me through the story. I appreciate it, hope you enjoy the rest of the story as well if not more than what has already been posted.

After having explained the situation of Arthur to Mrs Hudson, John might as well get the two acquainted. It might help ease the discomfort now being made by Arthur's relentless and unblinking staring, like that of a doctor preparing to perform a surgery or a pathologist doing an autopsy. 

"" Well Arthur- John started, pulling the two face to face, well more like face to chest or collar since Arthur's height was still that of a child- this is Mrs Hudson, the landlady- Mrs Hudson glanced at John- also not the housekeeper. Mrs Hudson, this is Arthur, the one who will be staying with me here for a few days. ""

Looking down at the small boy, Mrs Hudson flashed a friendly motherly smile

"" Oh aren't you just absolutely precious, dear boy "" She said, cupping Arthur's two cheeks still full with baby fat, thus making them extremely impossible not to pinch or in Mrs Hudson's case, squish. 

' Soft like marshmallow'

"" Nice to meet you too, Mrs Hudson""  Arthur replied, struggling to get his words out due Mrs Hudson's hold on part of his face. He still wasn't used to people being .............................................. kind to him. Being touched normally meant incoming hits to the body part being touched. 

The egg donor had suck awful taste in boyfriends. 

'Perhaps Father or maybe I should call him sperm donor, after all I have never met him and possibly never will, is even worse. God knows if he is even alive and has not, by some miracle, overdosed or landed himself in prison. '

The thought amused Arthur and he felt a bit too ecstatic for imagining his biological life giver's suffering. 


What if he is doing well and doesn't even know you exist ? 


That really got on Arthur's nerves, leaving his hands tighten into fists and his teeth grinding like he was chewing through a newly mauled prey . The thought of being essentially forgotten, it is even worse than being a mistake who only existed due to two people being horny and didn't think thing through, and also drugs. The idea that the fucking sperm donor was out there living life, hell, what if the fucker already had a family, partner and kids and all of that shit. If Arthur were to show up saying"" Hi, I am the accident that came from your one night stand with your fellow drug addict when you were high off your bloody mind "", the results wouldn't be good, not in the very least. 

' Can the word really be "" forgotten "" when your existence means nothing to them ? ' thought Arthur, that was another thing to add to the list "" Reasons why I may have parental issues""

Snapping back from his mind, he heard 

"" And you're so thin, we need to fatten you, boy. Put some meat on your bones"" Mr Hudson said, eyeing Arthur's appearance and deeming him to be in need of some good nourishment. That made Arthur look down at himself. His choice of clothes was off, but what could you do when you hardly had any clothes to alter between? And he was a bit on the thin side, though not enough to make his ribs poke out but it was still a bit concerning. 

It's not like he was picky about food, it's just that he couldn't stomach the nearly spoiled mush at home. 

' Poor boy needs to be fed ' Mrs Hudson thought and decided that she was going to bake him some goodies to fatten him up. 

"" As a matter of fact, Mrs H. I was just going to make breakfast for us. Would you like to join? "" John offered , already on his way to the fridge to get the ingredients. 

"" That's a delightful offer, John but I can't. "" Mrs Hudson politely declined. "" Still got some work to take care of. I only came here cause you have been so quiet yesterday. I thought-"" She closed her mouth before finishing her sentence 

John knew what she was going to say, he couldn't blame her for worrying too much. One of her boys had already died, so she couldn't afford another tragedy to happen. 

Saying a farewell, Mrs Hudson went off to continue her business, leaving only the two blonds in the flat. 

""Come on Arthur, let's go make some breakfast "" 

"" C-can I help, Mr John? "" 

"" Of course, lad""

After having breakfast (bacon,eggs, buttered toast and caramelized veggies), both of them sat on the couch , both trying to get used to the other's presence.

Arthur was feeling a bit uncomfortable, he never had breakfast often.

The conversation Mrs Hudson and John had had earlier had piqued Arthur's interest. Despite the lack of social skills, he could tell that the topic they were discussing was a bit on the sensitive side, due to the fact they intentionally lowered their volume so that he couldn't hear. He knew that he shouldn't get nosey but curiosity eventually got the best of him. After all he needed to better this new environment to avoid risking any provoking the people around here. 

' Now I think about it, I haven't seen Mr John's flatmate anywhere. And he looks like he slept on the couch yesterday ( indent on the couch, and the pillow and blanket on it confirm it). Why didn't he choose to stay in the other bedroom? Maybe he and his flatmate aren't close. '

Glancing at the furnishing of the living room, all the books, decorations, especially the skull that sat on the fireplace. It looked real and Arthur had to resist the urge to go and touch it to confirm his suspicion. 

' Impossible, the mingling of the furniture proves otherwise. Normally, people won't let their possession comes into contact with those of someone they don't trust. Insecurity, fear of thievery and being taken advantage of and the like. Then again the door to the bedroom is locked so maybe Mr John can't get in, even if he wants to. '

Recollection of the glimpse he got into he bedroom flashed before his eyes. 

'WRONG,  disastrously wrong. 'His mind shouted

' The inside was dusty.Even in the darkness, I could make out some of the dust on the floor and the other side of the door. So that bedroom haven't been used from some time now. What happened to his flatmate? They didn't move out that's for sure, the furniture and personal belongings were still there, in the bedroom. '

If you hasn't before then you maybe thinking that Arthur was peculiar and too aware for a kid. 

Due the lack of social interaction and loneliness, Arthur had developed this habit of keeping himself busy. Sometimes it was reading the books that hadn't been sold off with the intention of fueling mother's addiction, sometimes it was researching things off the Net in the local library, sometimes it was just going to the nearby park,  and see if anyone had left anything behind. Sometimes he would do that at school. ( he actually got his knitted cardigan that way and also a couple of jackets lying in his bags).

He never got caught, which was good. 

' Maybe the flatmate is dead ' the idea popped up in his head. 

' It's logical, and would like explain the aura Mr John is giving off, like someone who is in mourning'

Quickly enough, it was time for John to go to work. Seeing Arthur who had been sitting silently on the couch for a little too long, with his hands slightly raised and his finger tips touching each other, John decided to take one of his books off the shelves. The book was "" The hobbit"" , one of John's personal favourites

' I hope the kid likes this one, he seems to like reading ' 

"" Arthur, i'm going to go to work. Stay here and behave, okay lad? ""

Arthur nodded

"" Oh and here's a book to keep ya company. If you finish it early, you can grab another on the shelves . If you grow hungry, food is in the fridge. The telly remote is over there. OH and your clothes, I don't think I have any your size-""

"" I have a few in my bags, Mr John. ""

"" O-okay, well bye""

"" Goodbye Mr John, thank you for the book""

After John left, Arthur looked down at the book

""The hobbit"" He muttered 

"" Seems interesting "" And started to open the first page. 

On John's part ,  the work was as usual. The common cold, sprained ankle, sore throat, the like. The work was boring but fulfilling in a way, knowing he was doing some good curing the ill.After examining one of his patients,

' Stomach indigestion, typical '

John sat down at his table and lean back to get some rest.

Feeling his phone ring, he pulled it out. It was a text from Lestrade. 

It read:"" Bring the kid to the Yard at 3pm today. We need to do a DNA test "" 

"" Weird how they have already got a possible candidate "" John said under his breath. 

From what he knew, this type of cases usually didn't end with a relative being located. Being put into foster care was the normal outcome for case like this. 

Standing up , John headed to see Sarah his boss, to ask for an early leave. When she asked for the reason, John explained the situation vaguely, only telling the outline of thing, leaving out the fact said child in his care accidentally solved a case. 

Being kind and understanding, Sarah allowed him to leave early by two hours. John thought part of it was because they were low on patients today so what's the harm in allowing John to leave early to do some good. 

 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

As for Arthur, he was  back at the flat, nose deep in the book, reading each word with much vigor. 

It was more interesting than he expected, although he wished there had been more elaboration on the characters but this was a children book. 

Finally finishing the book after three hours of continuously reading, minus the time he had to close it temporarily to digest the knowledge that was dropped on him like a bomb. 

"" I kinda like this Bilbo fellow "" He muttered, a bit sad that the story had to end but then again, what didn't? 

After finishing the book John had given him, Arthur was, with all honesty, bored. Usually he didn't have any free time like this. He wondered if he asked nicely, could he go outside to gather some plants to observe. Back at home, there was a poison ivy bush growing near his house, he would pick some leaves( using a piece of paper as a barrier between his hand and the itch-inducing leaves) and make potion out of them, mostly just boiling them in an attempt to extract the substance inside that caused the itching and rashes

It had been silly but he had been only 8 or 9 at the time so his knowledge on chemistry had been rudimentary.He wondered if he had left them to dry out, would them still be as effective. If they were then it would be hard to distinguish them once mixed into dried tea leaves.

' That's a neat little idea' he thought, wondering if poison ivy would be strong enough to kill a person if enough was used 

There had also been mushrooms growing from the floor of his house. He knew it was due to the unhygienic circumstances, but they were still interesting to him nonetheless. 

He would pick them up, clean them, smell them, cut them open to observe the squishy inside, tries to see if he could grow more by planting one into the soil of the nearby park. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. 

It had been unclear to him whether they were poisonous or not. He had been tempted to pop one into his mouth. 

' If it's not, I will have something to eat, if it is, then I can escape this hellhole' was what he had thought at the time. To him, it was basically a win-win situation. And so down the mushroom went to his stomach. 

Fortunately ( for us of course ) , he only had a nasty urge to regurgitate, and he did. 

"" Maybe I should have put them into mother's food "" He said subconsciously while placing the book back on the shelf, considering the action seriously

  He decided it was best to move on to something else. No use thinking about the past

His mind wandered to the thought of all his new academic books for his year 7 in his bags, which were  gifted to him by the school since he was among the list of students living in poverty.

' Honestly we wouldn't be so bad off if she actually had some brain cells in her drug filled skull'

' Maybe I should get a head start in studying but it's so tedious sometimes. All the bloody formulas of mathematics. '

Despite being very capable of remembering those pesky formulas, he still groaned at the thought of doing things that were, in his opinion, not his cup of tea. He was more interested in human anatomy, biology, chemistry, medicine and lastly history than mathematics. 

He knew that mathematics is the very thing that helps human advance to this point of almost having mind-numbing conveniences. He knew the basics and everything required to work out everyday problems, how weird phenomenons can be explained with science and basic logic. 

"" Well that's enough over thinking for a day "" Arthur said, jumping off the couch and walked off to find something to do.

Back to John, he still had an hour left till he could leave, which was 1pm . Now was 12am , he still had about one or two patients left so it wasn't too hard. 

' Maybe i should seek out other place to work' he thought since this had become quite boring and mundane for him. 

' God that bastard rubbed off on me ' he thought, wondering how the dead could have such an impact on the living for being...........well dead. 

After all patients had been examined and diagnosed, he bid his colleagues and his boss good bye and gathered his things. 

On his way, he kept thinking of how he could get Arthur to share more of his home life prior to being abandoned. 

' He seems to be unaware of how devastating this kind of treatment is' John thought , remembering the tone Arthur had used when talking about his mother. It was cold, without any warmth, like when talking to a stranger. 

' Children coming from abusive or neglectful household generally don't grasp the full extent of their mistreatment, especially those who have endured this since young '

At least that was he knew about the subject. 

There were cases of the abused growing to become abusers themselves. It's ironic , in John's opinion, to become the one you once hated with every fiber of your being. In worse cases, they can have a complete breakdown, breaking their fragile psyche permanently

It's understandable that emotions can be unpredictable, it's the thing that can make us or break us. Emotions give us motivation to do things, but they can make us feel so crushed to the point of losing ourselves and grip on reality. 

John once heard a story from one of his military friends. When she ( the friend) was a teenager, a string of murder started happening in the neighborhood. The killer targeted women with blond hair, blue eyes, basically girls that were considered attractive. The bodies were mutilated, their skin ripped off their face, their vaginas stabbed with a, what the police assumed, kitchen knife,their breasts cut clean off and laid beside their bloody cadavers.

Turned out the killer was a girl, who was always shamed by her mother and father for not being "" perfect "", at school she was ridiculed for being one of the ugly ones. Due to this, the first time someone showed affection for her, she leeched on like a leech. Unfortunately for her, the guy only took advantage of her and then left. 

All of this broke her and she started to have the illusion that she could kill these "" perfect girls"" and get their most best assets, which were faces and breasts. She only left the breasts behind because they weren't good enough, in her broken mind. 

When the police caught her, she killed herself. 

The case was sad in John's opinion. It just made him feel both sorry and not sorry for the killer. Though he still leaned towards the idea that she should have been responsible for her horrible actions, a thought still lingered in his head 

What if they had gotten the girl help? 

What if she hadn't gone through all the mistreatment? 

So on and so forth, but it was quite useless to worry about the past now

And yet you're still hung up on him .His annoying mind taunted him. 

He quickly swatted that  input away, locking it in a chamber with lots of locks and chains in his mind dedicated to unwanted things, where it sat alongside some of his war memories and other complicated feelings and thoughts that couldn't be said. The chamber always had whispers and screams emitting from it but John could brush them away easily enough


"" First time? "" The other emotions and thoughts that John had previously locked away greeted the newcomer


 

 

Arriving at Baker Street, John walked up the stairs leading to his flat. He hoped Arthur didn't get bored being in the flat all day. 

Opening the door, John could still see the hallucination of Sherlock, just standing there in all his glory, trench coat, suit, scarf and all, staring through his very soul. He had been having these for a few months now. At the beginning, he would find himself waking up, carrying out an entire conversation with fake Sherlock, nearly forgetting about the suicide, until reality kicked in and Sherlock would vanish, leaving John behind questioning his sanity. Mycroft had revealed his supposed "" concern "" about John's condition. John wondered why the governmental official even bothered with him. His brother was dead, John had no uses anymore. Why choose to keep helping him? John would never understand that.

He even threatened to admit John into a mental asylum, which wasn't something that John took to. 

He was already considered pathetic enough, in his view, he didn't need another reason to hate himself. To please the ginger demon and possibly get some peace, John had decided to ignore all his hallucinations. Sometimes it worked with fake Sherlock slowly fading away, sometimes he broke down crying, mumbling incoherent noises and reaching for something sharp. 

Watching the vision slowly fade into nothing, like many times before, he called out for Arthur

"" Arthur, I am home. Where are you? ""

Sure enough, a head of blond locks immediately came into view

"" Ah, I see you have freshened up, lad ""

Arthur was now wearing a pair of dark grey trousers, a cream coloured wrinkled shirt. On the sofa, he could see the clothes Arthur had worn yesterday. Walking over to the sofa, John carefully picked up the pile of clothes, Hearing Arthur audible gasp and the hesitation to let him come in contact with the clothes, John said :

"" No worry, lad. I am just going to put them in the laundry basket for a wash"" 

Arthur maneuvered his raised hand down, feeling a bit red in the cheeks for having reacted so rashly, despite the fact John didn't seem to mind.

"" Well good news, Arthur. Lestrade managed to locate a possible relative of yours."" John said, taking off his beige overcoat to hang on the coat hanger. 

"" Though it is weird that you will need to do a DNA exam "" He continued 

"" Well mother never was close to any of her family members "" Arthur said, remembering all the time mother would drunkenly reveal a lot of her issues to him during her high, with profanity , sex, trauma and all. 

"" I won't be surprised if they try to deny my existence. ""

"" o-okay "" John let out, not knowing whether he should proceed with the conversation. In the end, he decided to push forward with it

"" Anyway, you are always about your mother. Mind if you tell me more about your father? "" John said gently

"" You don't have to, if you don't want to, Arthur "" He added, seeing Arthur's hesitant expression. 

"" No I want to "" He replied, after a minute of contemplating. 

"" Well - he started, a bit nervous, he had never had to to talk about father , he didn't even know what he looked like - I don't know much about father, he has never been in the picture. ""

Well, John's speculation was confirmed. 

"" I only know that he was mother's one-night-stand or one-night-fuck ""

John was a little surprised at how Arthur knew that word, okay maybe not much considering the kid's home life but it was still startling to hear that word coming from a kid. Maybe it was not that fact that he knew the word rather than how he discovered the meaning and the situation in which he learnt it. 

"" Whenever she was drunk or high or well both,- the images of numerous beer bottles and pill containers flashed before John's eyes, he wondered if this imaginary imagery of his was any close to the real one - she would cry and lament and blame everything in existence, blaming father, blaming me, despite the fact that I am sure that part of it was because of her horny arse "" The last one was said in a mutter but John still caught it. 

"" Sometimes she would force me to listen to her lamenting about how her passionate night with father was, how she should have used me to pin it again him and force him into marriage. She said he came from a rich background. 

Fortunately for the sperm donor, she never found him ""

Finishing his story , Arthur added a flick of both his hands, as if this was just a normal topic to come up in conversations. John 

John opened his mouth to speak but closed it again , rethinking his question again. Finally he said 

"" So, do you have any idea what he looks like? "" 

"" It would help with our investigation "" He added quickly. 

Arthur seemed to believe it

"" Well, Mr John, I only know what mother described to me. If I remember correctly and mother wasn't deliriously making things up, he has black hair ( though I doubt that will narrow anything), is tall and lean. But that could be anyone. "" He said, trying not to remember all the graphic depiction mother provided about his lower region. 

"" And what about demeanour? "" John asked subconsciously, honestly he didn't even know why he would be asking such a question. 

"" Oh mother never mentioned it, that's how she is, always saying how much of a bloody looker he was and how she should have trapped him to the old balls and chains. Though I do remember one time she said that he wasn't such a gentleman, but he made up in - Arthur shuddered at the exact words of his mother - other ways "" He said, hoping that John would get the meaning without him having to outright say it. 

And he did, indicated by his wide eyes and slight redding on the face

Can't believe I am already on chapter 11.Hope you all like the development of Arthur's character.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Looking at the time, John saw it was time for them to get going , can't keep Lestrade waiting. Putting on his overcoat again, he helped Arthur put on his cardigan ( it was cold out today despite being summer,and John's doctor instinct wasn't having a kid go out without any things to keep him warm). John didn't have any spare scarf for Arthur so he took a deep breathe and walked to his bedroom to grab a dark blue scarf that once had been in the possession of the world's only consulting detective. After his death, John had taken the scarf to his room. There were times he would cry into it until he fell asleep, times he would wrap it around his neck, pulling a tad too tight and contemplate whether he should do it. 

The option was so tempting. But he hadn't gone through with it ( lucky us), only because of his stupidly stubborn belief that Sherlock was alive. Another thing to keep him going is to see the day when Sherlock's name was cleared and he was in fact innocent.

Walking back downstairs, John pulled the scarf around Arthur's neck, wrapping it neatly and snuggly around the young child. 

And off they went to New Scotland Yard, catching a cab and instructing the driver about the location. 

Arriving at the Yard, they hopped out and came in the building. 

The place wasn't particularly crowded that day and most, if not all of the officers, didn't exactly bat an eye at the two blonds, few would give a quick glance, the more unsavoury ones would openly snarl, knowing how John had worked together with Sherlock on many cases. 

"" Hey it's the Freak's little dog again, look like he has got a mini Freak with him? "" One of the annoying officers whispered to his other colleagues, who all giggled, not knowing that John had heard every single bit of it. They only mentioned the mini Freak part because of the fact Arthur was with John, not because of his appearance. Those fuckers weren't able to get a good look at him, partly for the long scarf covering a portion of his face. But the single fact that he was with John was enough for their fat, greasy, donut-eating mouths to start moving. 

Glancing at the group of officers shit talking, he could see among the members there were Donovan and Anderson. 

' Go figures'

' Calm calm, peace and damn gutting quiet, just calm down John, you can do it. You're better than these fucking tossers' John reassured himself while simultaneously swearing in all the languages that he was fluent in, which was surprisingly lots for someone deemed as so painfully average and forgettable. 

' Honestly how did they even get this job? Those wankers!! Bloody fannies '

John was starting to understand why Sherlock had always complained of the Yard being filled with"" idiots with less intelligence than a primitive amoeba "" . He hoped that Arthur hadn't heard any of that. 

They quickly their way to Lestrade's office. 

They met Lestrade at his office, who was actually looking better than yesterday, he no longer had the crow nest of a head and bloodshot eyes. 

'Well he doesn't look like total shit anymore ' thought the two blonds. 

He guided they to where Arthur would take the DNA exam

"" Where's the candidate? "" John asked, seeing that there was no one in sight beside them and another person who would be taking Arthur's blood sample to send for examination. 

"" Oh- he is busy, he has already given us his blood sample. "" Lestrade answered, scratching his head. 

' he? ' John thought

"" Who is this guy supposed to be in relation with Arthur? "" He asked. 

"" Well he is speculated as his uncle but it needs to be confirmed "" Lestrade quickly replied, almost as if he had expected John to ask

"" And what can he do for Arthur's situation ? "" John pressed forward, honestly not trusting this supposed uncle, especially if the wanker couldn't even come here and see his nephew's face for himself. 

"" Well-well, we're looking into it "" 

And no other additional answers were provided for the rest of the procedure. No matter how he asked, Lestrade would just clam up, saying that they were still looking into it. 

After the procedure was done, they were informed that the result would come in after a few days, so in the meantime it was decided that Arthur would keep staying with John. 

""So do you wanna to go anywhere, lad? It's still quite early "" John asked, looking at his watch and realising that it was only about 5pm.

Looking up in the sky, Arthur thought for a moment. 

"" Can we go to the park, Mr John? "" 

"" Of course""

Arriving at the park, John sat down on a nearby bench while Arthur went around , taking in the view. He had never been to this park before. It was greener than the one he had gone to. 

Meanwhile John looked around the park. It had been a while since he had been out this much. Truth to be told, he had been burying himself in work and in his extensive  mourning to even find the energy  and motivation  to go out. His mind began to wonder what would happen when the DNA result came. 

He didn't trust this supposed uncle of Arthur at all. I mean who would even not bother seeing the face of unknown close relative. Not to mention that Arthur had said that he didn't know any family members besides his mother. 

' Surely this can't be one of those human traffickers. One can't simply be that stupid. It's like be willing to get caught by the police ' John thought, glancing at the small frame of Arthur, making sure he hadn't gone so far. The young boy was poking at the ground with a stick he had found nearby. 

' And if the guy really is Arthur's uncle then can he really help him? What if his whole family is fucked up? What if his family doesn't accept him?' 

Ah yes the caretaker's instinct was kicking in yet again. 

Standing up, John started walking towards where he last saw Arthur with the intention of checking up on the boy, after all he hadn't seen a sight of the blond head for the last 25 minutes now and he was beginning to feel anxious. 

Turning around the trees with their uneven branches and overgrown roots , he searched for any signs of the boy, occasionally yelling his name in hope of catching his attention. To everyone else, he probably seemed like a dad looking for his overactive son that managed to slip out of his sight when he had least expected it. 

If you paid attention, you might even see some parents nearby chuckling sympathetically , with the "" Yeah we all have been there"" look on their faces. 

John, however, was too focused on the task at hand to notice it. 

Arriving at the less populated area of the park, John finally found Arthur leaning against the trunk of a large tree. 

""Arthur, there you- John stopped when he registered the soft whimpering, bruises and scratches on the boy's face. His cardigan had been made worse by the appearance of some brown spots, most likely caused by dirty, other than that he seemed alright. 

He quickly got closer, worried that Arthur was hurt. Crouching down to Arthur's level, he slowly reached for his face, cupping it gently before slightly raising it up for easy examination. 

' Face slightly bruised and scratched, still some evidence of dirt, probably from face colliding with the ground. Dirt got in eyes. Slight dirt and leaves in hair'

Next to check were his arms and legs. Trailing his eyes downward, John noticed a little bump rising up from the midsection of Arthur's cardigan. It was moving, wiggling upwards. 

A yelp startled John and out popped a little kitten, full black with the only exceptions being a third of its face, on the right , being orange and its front paws being white(as least from what John could see since it lower half was still nested in Arthur's cardigan)making it look like the creature was wearing tiny socks. Upon closer examination, he noticed the small feline was bleeding a little from its left front leg. 

' So the whimpering was from the cat ? ' thought John, a bit relieved that it wasn't Arthur  

Reaching for the cat, John was caught off guard when his wrist was soon held in place by Arthur's hand. 

""Don't-don't hurt i-it, please"" He pleaded, in his eyes John's image was beginning to fade out and be replaced by that of someone less merciful of small unexpected creatures appearing in front of them. 

"" P-please, just d-don't "" He repeated

 

 

Writing this has made me realize how fucking wild my imagination is .You may realize this by now but I just love having the characters' thought process and inner turmoil be heard. The narrative is a mirror, reflecting the characters' inner thoughts.I hope this doesn't get on your nerves.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          






Mother was never kind to him these days or ever. 



"" What the hell do you have there, brat? "" She spat out venomously, almost like one would to a convicted felon, eyes once intelligent now were nothing but dimwitted 



"" A dog"" Arthur replied, managing not to choke on his own words. He had only wanted to help the poor canine. Eyes widened in anger and reddened from all the drugs and alcohol, the woman yanked the dog out of Arthur's clutches, still yelping and weeping in pain, and threw it out of the door. The poor dog landed a bit harshly but was lucky to still be able to run away, albeit with a noticeable limp



' No broken bones ' noted Arthur, glad that at least the dog would live another day, in peace at least. Unlike Arthur, who was about to face yet another onslaught by the hands of the being that was supposed to care for him. 



"" You listen you fucking dirt face, we already have a pest in this house- she said, pointing her long fake nails accusingly at Arthur, almost making contact with his face, especially the freckles he was quote-unquote "" cursed"" with, and then pulled away a mere second later like he was evil reincarnated



'Narrow-minded fanny.Don't even know that freckles are a natural occurrence, not some bloody voodoo magic of the damned ' 



' Well, maybe you shouldn't have been such a cock sucker and should actually have taken birth control. And better yet, not have sex when high as a damn kite on a windy day. But no you had to get your bloody cunt filled with bloody fucking sperm, eh? ' was what Arthur wanted to retaliate with but he knew better. He had to keep the facade of being oblivious lest he get beatened and starved, more often that is. It's great he didn't stand out so much and could easily blend in the background when needed. 



' Probably think I am retarded or some shit ' he thought bitterly. Despite not showing any signs of mental underdevelopment and always getting good grades in school (' not that the egg donor would care ' thought Arthur, remember the fact that she had never attended even one of the many parent-teacher conferences) , the woman would always call Arthur"" stupid"", ""idiot "", "" retard"","" brainless"", "" fucking mistake"", "" dirt face""



' Impressive how she manages to pronounce all of them right and yet always slurs when she speaks.Must be the drugs getting to her brain. Honestly, it's like all the pills and drugs have sucked out all of her brain matter' he commented. His biological birth giver was no more than a damn ditzy, brainless whore going through a string of boyfriends in the span of one night. 



 He shuddered at the thought of being anything like her or the sperm donor. The egg donor was once a brilliant lady, with a bright future



' Too bloody bad she gave it all up for drugs '



Sperm donor, on the other hand, wasn't known much by Arthur, other than the fact that he fucked egg donor, thus resulting in him being born into this barren, loveless household



' I would rather die than become like them' Arthur concluded strongly



' Hell, I don't even know what that dickhead looks like' 



And Arthur didn't intend on finding out. Sure he like mysteries but this was no interesting one, just a plain and sad one. Two people shagged, the lady got pregnant, birthed child, the child got neglect. 



' What will come next? Me becoming a damn serial killer ? ' he lamented his own fate 



By the age of 8 maybe even 7, Arthur already had known all the swear words and profanities there were in the book. He liked using the terms "" wanker"", "" tosser"","" fanny "", "" bollocks"".He still knew some of the more offensive ones,sex-wise and race-wise, but he didn't like using them much due to their severity.



After the verbal bashing and a few slaps to the face, Arthur quietly walked back to his small room, not able to find a silver of emotions for the woman that wasn't hatred, bitterness, or resentment. He had long stopped caring about her. 



 Cleaning the floor the best his then little 9-year-old hands could, he proceeded to prop his body down on the floor, not bothering or wanting to get on the dirty mattress less than a meter away from him. He closed his eyes, used his hands to try and shut out the moaning going downstairs. He really hoped he wouldn't be getting a half-sibling. They didn't deserve the same fate he was enduring. 


This is why some people just shouldn't be parents.

Now back to the present

Arthur, still holding John's hand in place, ( he was surprisingly strong for a kid of course but John could easily overpower him if he wanted but then again he wasn't a heartless bastard, plus, he actually had morals ), continued pleading John not to hurt the poor creature, that he would just help it and then it would be out of John's sight, all the while holding the little kitten close to his chest, fearing for the little creature's life and also his own. Seeing how John's fists tighten sent him more into a panic attack. He was dealing with an ex-military man, who knows what he was capable of. 

In actuality, John wasn't even mad or upset at Arthur. All his anger was directed to Arthur's ""parent"".

' Hell, that bitch doesn't even deserve such a damn title ' deemed John, honestly wanting to punch the living daylight out of the kid's parents. The mom was sure to receive a sock in the face for neglecting her child to the point of abandoning him in broad fucking daylight. Despite being raised to always respect women, that women were never able to do any harm( what bullshit) , John was still a firm believer in the lifestyle of "" Don't care what you have in your pants,mate if you're a dick, you deserve a kick, preferably in the face or crotch "", though in this situation it should be ""kicks"" 

In the midst of his rambling, Arthur didn't notice that the curious little furball in his care had dropped out of his yellow cardigan. Rolling down the track that was Arthur's legs, the kitten uncurled itself from its ball-like position and looked up at John with its forest green eyes. 

As the little bundle of softness reached for the doctor, he instinctively picked it up, first sliding his hands under its armpits and gingerly lifted it up to his eye level, getting a small ' meow' aimed at him. 

No sooner had John lifted the little creature into his arms than Arthur opened his eyes wide, realising that the kitten was no longer snuggled up in his cardigan.

""Don't- began Arthur in a shaky voice, toe the line of being almost jelly-like. 

"" Lad -John started with a gentle voice, lowering himself more in a subconscious attempt not to frighten Arthur more - I am not going to do anything to the kitten, except nursing it back to health of course "" He finished with a light chuckle, glad to see that Arthur's expression was lightening up.

"" Come on, Arthur. Let me get you cleaned up first "" John said, pulling out a handkerchief ( glad he brought it along) and rubbed the dirt off Arthur's face till he could clearly see the little boy's freckles once again. Next up was pulling the leaves and twigs out of his curly locks, which unexpectedly didn't take so long. Padding off any dirt on his cardigan and trousers, John helped Arthur stand up. 

"" Now mind telling me how a kitten managed to land in your care, lad? "" 

Looking down in slight embarrassment, Arthur began:

"" I-i was looking for plants to observe- Arthur scratched his head in embarrassment. At school, he was considered weird because of his fascination with collecting, observing, and dissecting, fortunately, he often blended in( just another figure in the background)so well that most if not all would just forget that was him. It was one of the many ways he had avoided bullies- I was picking up some snails near a bush and then I saw a bunch of kids, more precisely four- he raised four of his fingers for greater emphasis-, about twelve years old to fourteen years old, throwing pebbles at the poor kitty. I asked them why they were doing that. They said the cat was bad luck and why anyone would miss bad luck. I couldn't let them kill it so I snatched it off the ground and ran off, diving into a bush to hide from the kids.- looking at the ground, he grinded his teeth together- Why those morons would believe in such superstitious gibberish is beyond me "" He said the last sentence in a mutter but still audible enough for John to make it out. 

' Well I am starting to lose hope in humanity ' John thought, absolutely baffled as to why anyone in this time and age would still believe in such nonsense. 

"" I didn't do anything wrong"" Arthur quickly added as if he would be blamed had he not done so. 

"" No, you didn't, Arthur. You did the right thing, lad. Now let's go, we need to buy some stuff for our new little furry guest "" John exclaimed, ruffling Arthur's hair into a puffy mess and letting him take hold of the kitten once again. 

"" Hold its injured leg out for me, please lad? "" John said, pulling a small piece of cloth from his handkerchief. 

"" Okay Mr John"" Arthur replied, doing as he told. 

The small kitten hissed a bit in pain but allowed it nonetheless. 

Looping the cloth around its bleeding leg, John tied a moderately secure knot in hope of not causing it much discomfort. 

"" There, that should do until we get back home and fix the fella up for good ""

Thankfully, a local pet shop was nearby. Walking into the shop with Arthur walking closely behind, John requested a small bottle of disinfectant made for pets and a bag of cat food. 

' I already have bandages and cotton back at home so no need to buy that '

"" Having some father and son time, eh, mate? "" The shop owner asked, a fond smile appearing on her face, giving her a motherly vibe. 

"" U-uh yeah "" John lied, knowing that doing so was better than risk saying no and causing any suspicion on why a grown man was being accompanied by a child that wasn't related to him. Misunderstanding can lead to some very disastrous situations and John wasn't in the mood for any of those. He figured that it was the hair and nose that were making them seem related. 

"" Well make sure to make the best use of these years, kids you know, they grow up so fast, "" The shop owner said fondly, packing up John's purchase before giving it to him with a warm smile

John breathed out a thank you, giving her a friendly smile before bidding her goodbye. Arthur also waved back a goodbye to the lady who waved gleefully. 

' The kid really inherited his dad's smile' she thought before turning around to help another customer who was looking for the perfect brand of food for her picky eater of a parrot. 


Bonus part: a doodle I made of Arthur( i tried guys but at last I am no artist)



 










Hope you enjoy the little flashback, I hope to include them more to give all the characters more depth. It will be a while before Sherlock shows up so buckle up for the ride, my lovelies. And also hope you like the little doodle I made after finishing my exam early

' I hope Mrs Hudson won't mind having a cat roaming around the flat. She has never mentioned any policies against having animals in the flat. ' John thought as he recalled when he first moved into Baker Street. 

Arthur was looking down at the little feline all snuggled up in his cardigan, purring and kneading at the fabric of Arthur's clothing. The creature looked no more than 3 months, its long tail all curled up around its torso. 

On their way home, the kitty would occasionally get a little antsy and start to climb out of the cardigan, either to claw its way to Arthur's head or onto the pavement. Fortunately, they managed to tuck it back to safety before its small head hit the cold, hard concrete underneath. 

Arriving at the flat, John dug through his belongings to pull out a med kit. Reaching into said item, he pulled out some cotton balls and bandages. 

'First, disinfect the wound' 

Soaking the cotton ball in pet disinfectant, he gently dabbed it on the kitten's wound, earning a light hiss from the creature's pink mouth adorned with small yet piercing fangs and a few thrashes in a vain attempt to wiggle it's way out of Arthur's hold. 

After a few minutes and an near assault straight to John's face later, the two of them managed to patch the kitty up, which was now sitting on the sofa ,innocently licking its paw, like it hadn't been an absolute menace to deal with a few moments ago. 

"" You prat "" John said jokingly to the cat taking up residence on the sofa with Arthur sitting beside it,scratching its soft underside.

"" You nearly did a number on my face ""He added, feeling his face for any scratches that he was made unaware of 

Relieved that was none, he relaxed. 

' Injuries on the torso and limbs are easier to cover than ones on the face ' he thought, clutching his right arm. Still stung a little. 

"" Arthur, can you go to the sink and grab a bowl for me, lad? "" To which Arthur gladly obliged, nodding and letting go the soft puffball and heading right to the kitchen. 

John pulled a specific brand of cat food that the shop owner had recommended to him. 

He figured that from an outsider's perspective, this would look eerily domestic, like father and son adopting a pet. 

While he did admit that he liked taking care of people, he feared this would all be temporary. That in a few days, everything would go back to "" normal"" , with John coming home to an empty flat and having to face the illusion of Sherlock that his mind had made, with no one to remind that the Sherlock standing in his flat was not real, that Sherlock wasn't telling him he meant more to him than in actuality( oh how John wished), that Sherlock wasn't telling him to follow him, eyeing the window of the flat or the drawer where John kept his gun and looking back at John, with that bloody knowing grin, showing exactly what the doctor thought the madman was hinting at. 

"" Look at you now John. Taking care of a dull child. How boring "" Fake Sherlock sneered, standing in the hallway in his dressing gown, hair and face looking like he had done an experiment or two. 

' Sod off' John thought, ignoring the abomination that his deranged mind had projected. 

He feared one day he might listen to what fake Sherlock had to say. 

Fake Sherlock was as much of a dick, if not more than the real one. 

"" I am real, John.You know it "" The illusion scoffed back, crossing his arms 

John honestly didn't

He shook his head lightly, relieved to see that when he opened his eyes, Sherlock was gone. 

' Guess I get to keep my sanity for another day' he thought humourlessly 

Seeing Arthur returning with a bowl, John tore open the bag and poured it into the bowl. The rattling of cat kibbles landing into the bowl caught the feline's attention and it started charting towards them, meowing its head off. 

"" Here you go, kitty"" Arthur said, placing the bowl, whose content was quickly being devoured by the cat. 

""Mr John, what is going to happen to kitty? "" Arthur asked 

"" Us nursing it back to health "" He replied, putting the kettle on the stove. He was in great need of a cuppa. 

The rest of the night went on as well as it could. 

In morning, John was up making breakfast when Arthur came down, still a bit sluggish and dozy after awakening from his slumber. 

"" Why didn't you sleep in the other bedroom, Mr John? You look horrible."" He asked absent-mindedly

John froze, he never told Arthur about Sherlock's bedroom. 

""W-what? "" Managed John

"" Your flatmate's bedroom, I am sure he wouldn't mind "" Arthur replied, still a bit too sleepy to acknowledge the fact that his mouth was slipping too much

His response astonished John even more

"" How did you? "" 

Still sleepy and not hit by self-realization that he was showing his other side that he rarely put on display. It always managed to freak people out. 

"" The flat is too big for you, a man living alone, to need or even want, given your humble appearance and personality,not to mention it is in the centre of the city. I assume you have a flatmate. Yesterday morning, I noticed you had slept on the couch, indicated by your hair,posture, pillow and blanket on the couch. At first I thought it was because the two of you weren't close but the style and arrangement of furniture here said otherwise. One would never want their belongings to mingle with those of a being they don't trust. The inside of the bedroom was dusty so perhaps he hasn't been home for a while .-

Looking around the flat, John realized that every one of Sherlock's belongings were still here, every single one taunting him about the death of the detective. 'Yesterday I noticed a dressing gown, made for male.It was too big for you so I concluded your flatmate was male -'

As if his brain had finally flipped on the emotional intelligence switch , it dawned on Arthur that he was getting too comfortable around John, letting out useless speculations like that. They were correct, going by John's reaction.But it was basically asking for a ridicule or worse, a beating. 

Arthur managed his best not to tremble, reaching into his cardigan to catch a feel of the pocket knife. Despite knowing he was safe, his body just decided that danger was near and he needed to go paranoid. 

"" Brilliant"" was not the reaction he had expected, even without the additional anxiety. 

"" W-what? You're not mad or annoyed"" It was Arthur's turn to be confused. 

"" Of course not, well surprised yes - John began, walking towards Arthur and crouching down- but I am not angry, I told when you came here that you would be safe ""

"" Sorry, Mr John"" He said instinctively, he always made sure to apologize for whatever it was that was upsetting anyone. No one ever bothered to tell what he did wrong.

John's glaze softened

"" You don't need to apologize, Arthur. ""

"" Do you want to talk about your flatmate, Mr John? "" Arthur asked, noticing the choke John forced down, like he was going to say something and then decided not to. 

"" It's too sensitive for you, lad ""

A bit indignant, Arthur said back:"" Mr John, you have already witnessed me having two breakdowns. I know more than the average kid should ""

The man had done so much for him these last few days, the least he could do was offer a sympathetic ear. 

' Maybe he loves the flatmate ' thought Arthur. ' that would explain so much. Maybe he died and Mr John never had the opportunity to confess his feelings. Unrequited love perhaps? Seem possible ' 


 I don't want you near any of those filthy sinners 


The egg donor's voice echoed within the premises of his skull

' Wrong'

He always thought the hatred was unnecessary and frankly disgusting. The world was overpopulated enough as it was, with all the accidental babies here and there, him being one himself.What was wrong with letting people love freely? To Arthur's mind, who you shag didn't matter nearly as much as your personality. 

John let out a chuckle , one he hadn't had the privilege of having for some time now. Arthur thought he should laugh more. 

"" Well you ask for this, lad. Just don't blame me when you get traumatized "" Setting up another chair to sit on, John began:

"" His name was Sherlock Holmes and he, despite being an arrogant dickhead, a genius with no people skills whatsoever , was the best thing to happen to my life""

"" How does one be arrogant and still be considered in good light by anyone? "" Arthur muttered but going by John's uproarious laugh, he probably overheard it

"" That's what I thought too. But he just made me feel alive again, he saved me in a way. I wish I could have done the same. "" John began to choke up, Arthur tried to comfort him like he had done for him, placing his hand on John's forearm, to which John immediately jerked back due to the sharp sting

"" So-sorry lad, I got startled. That's all "" John lied through his teeth. 

"" Now eat up your breakfast before it gets cold""

A meow interrupted their conversation

"" I guess kitty is also hungry "" John remarked as he saw the little furry head popping out, stretching its petite body,its claw on full display. 

"" I will take care of it, Mr John "" Arthur said, snatching the cat food to go feed the hungry knife retractor. 

He wondered how long this would last 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Getting Mrs Hudson to agree with the cat staying here wasn't as trialing as John had imagined. Once she saw the puny little puffball popping out it's head and meowing at her, showing its tiny squishy toe beans , Lord knows she couldn't resist such cuteness. 

"" Fine, you can keep the little fur ball in the flat but remember to take care of it. I am not your housekeeper, dear "" She said, pointing a finger in a teacher-like manner to John, who was nodding sheepishly, just glad that he managed to overcome this trivial trial. Turning back to Arthur, she pulled out a small bag of cookies. 

"" Here dear, have some goodies, you need some fattening up "" She said, pinching Arthur's soft cheek

"" Thank you Mrs Hudson"" Arthur replied, practically beaming. 

Something about this scene just warmed John's fractured heart. 

"" Why would you take such an interest in such a dull and predictable pest? Surely I am much more fascinating"" Echoed the illusion taking the imagine of the dead as he stood near the innocent kitten napping soundly, face twisted into a snarl, before averting his attention to Arthur already with a chocolate chip cookies hanging from his mouth

"" Absolutely dull and idiotic "" He scoffed, accompanied with a dramatic flick of his hand. 

' Well this Sherlock is probably even more of a prick than the real one.

Probably '

Taking in a deep breath, John told himself that once Arthur and the cat were relocated to a safer place, he would have all the time in the world to break down ,cry and relieve the stress within the walls of confinement, without any judgement or pity from any living beings 

"" It's terribly dull, John.It's simply not interesting to be alive anymore . Everyone is an idiot compared to me. They would bring you down to being ordinary- Disgust immediately got plastered on the detective's face - Why don't you follow my guide and join me already? We can be together again"" The baritone voice spoke again, still as rich and velvety as the first time John had heard it.

' Look mind, if you arsehole is going to recreate an illusion in the shape of Sherlock bloody Holmes, at least make it accurate and not based on what I damn bollocking feel about the madman ' John thought,muttering to himself that the real Sherlock "" married to my work "" Holmes would never say the last part, that sentiment to Sherlock was basically what dead body parts kept in the fridge was to ordinary people disgusting beyond comprehension, except in Sherlock's case, it was with an addition of hatred, indifferent and inferiority. 

Even if John had had the balls to confess before all this, it would most certainly have just ended up in John being mocked and ridiculed for his "" idiotic and superfluous feelings "" by the mad genius himself. Hearing that would probably devastate him. 

' Though maybe I should have told him, better getting hurt and then having my feelings rejected than whatever the damn tossing hell this is .And Sherlock would forget about it in a day or two, at most, given how he always deletes useless memories '

John honestly thought it would have been better if he had just got rejected by Sherlock. It would be better to just bear some hurtful ,sharper than a knife and sting worse than a bullet wound words , put on a smile and move on.It would have helped him get over this turmoil of his faster and get some closure. 

Killing one's feelings is always so much more manageable if the object of your affection wants nothing to do with you. What is better for your feelings,a quick death or a slow one dragged out unnecessarily long and painful that it lefts a massive hole in your chest and makes you wonder what is wrong with you. 

"" So what is her name, John? "" Mr Hudson asked, having two handfuls of fluff in her hands, tickling the kitten's soft and pump tummy. 

John stopped for a moment, he hadn't thought of keeping the cat indefinitely. Pets take a lot of responsibility and mental stability, something that he wasn't even sure if it was still in his possession or not. 

"" I... haven't gotten that far yet? "" He admitted 

"" Typical of you, John "" Fake Sherlock remarked in a huff , brows furrowed together, face grimacing ,teeth baring, still glaring daggers at the two new guests of the flat. 

Glancing quickly at the deranged hallucination that his broken mind had conjures up with all his guilt, grief and doubt 

"" I am real, John. Do stop being an idiot "" He retaliated as if knowing what John was thinking

' Then again, Sherlock always did so kudo to you brain for getting that right, you prick '

"" CLAWDIA "", a child-like voice boomed 

"" Her name will be Clawdia. "" Arthur added, eyes looking at the little ball of cuteness nomming on one of her paws. 

"" Is that okay, Mr John, Mrs Hudson? ""He asked, looking for affirmation. 

"" That's a good name, Arthur"" John responded with a smile 

"" It's lovely, dear"" Mrs Hudson followed, patting the boy's curly head of hair, amazed at how soft and fine it was. Then again blond do general have finer strands of hair. The rest of the morning and afternoon was the same old thing, going to work, dealing with incompetent patients who apparently couldn't even tell the truth about how they forgot to take their medication on time. One even had the audacity to accuse John of giving her cheap medicine and one particularly unsavory man was just boasting all about his nights of passion with all the young, hot curvaceous ladies

' Yes, Mr Harness the story of your carelessness leading to you getting AIDS is so inspiring that I am about to drop down and cry .Oh bloody blimey the inspiration!!' was what John had to resort to biting his tongue to keep from spilling out. Last week, one of his fellow co-workers had slipped up and made a comment on a patient's health,which was no doubt true in every sense of the word and was just made in attempt to show concern but the patient just threw a damn hissy fit, threatening to sue the clinic for "" defamation of her character "" . 

' Rich considering she insulted one of the sweetest janitors there is in the whole clinic the moment she walked her diabetic arse in here ' judged John as he finally was done listening to the bastard's conquests and sent him off with a dry smile and an indifferent goodbye which were hard to distinguish from his real ones, something he was immensely glad for.

Finally time for his lunch break, John let out a sigh of utmost relief, thanking all the holy beings in the damn universe. 

Reaching into his bag to pull out his wrapped sandwich and tea thermos, he was about dig in when Sarah walked into his office. 

"" Oh hey Sarah, what brings you here? "" John greeted, putting his lunch down. 

""Can't I just want to chat with a friend,John? "" She said playfully

"" Fair enough. So what's up? "" John replied, unwrapping his sandwich and opening his tea thermos 

"" Oh I'm fine. And you, John? "" 

The stiffness in her voice and the undoubtedly strained smile made John's eyebrows raise. Finally a lightbulb lit up above his head and he frowned

"" Sarah, you don't need to unwillingly talk to me just cause I look lonely ""

The fake smile immediately got washed off her face. 

"" John- her voice softened, fill with pity and..... maybe concern, John wasn't sure - I am just worried about you. Ever since that day, you have been.... down. You rarely speak to any of us unless necessary. ""

John was about to open his mouth but Sarah was fast. 

"" I know that your work performance is just as good as always but you should know that I am not just your boss, I am your friend and i'm worry about you. In fact all your co-workers are. You know you can tell us if anything bothers you"" 

' Can I really ? What if I told you that I have been having vivid almost eerie illusion of my dead flatmate that is always urging me to follow him? Would you still look at me with those sympathetic eyes? Would any of you do? '

"" Sarah, I appreciate your concern over your employee but really, I am fine. I'm a grown man, not some small fetus, I can take care of myself ""

"" If you say so, John but promise me that if anything happens, you will seek help "" Sarah's eyes pierced through his soul. Oh how he hated those looks packed with so much pity, it was like he was some broken thing that would break at the slightest touch of the wind. 

"" I promise "" He said, forcing a lump in his throat

And with that Sarah was out of the door, leaving John with an utter loss of appetite. He quietly wrapped back his uneaten sandwich and took a large gulp of his tea, trying hard to keep it together. 

The rest of his shift continued as normal, thankfully his last patients were sick children, accompanied by their concerned but not so aggressive parents. The kids were well-behaved, albeit a bit shy, which was something John understood given how much children are afraid of doctors with all their needles and bitter pills. 

After bidding the patients and their parents goodbye, John packed up his things, took of his lab coat and went home. 

 

Finally after a fuck ton of mid term exams , I am back with some more final mid term exams but no worries I will try to update as soon as possible ( thank you my school allow students to use their phones after they finish work) , . Anyway hope you enjoy the latest chapter, I am astonished as how far we have come but there is still a long way to go so buckle up my dear. Remember to comment, give kudo or bookmark my work you want to see more


Two days later 


' I wonder when the DNA results will come? ' John questioned( for the fifth time these past two days) while reading the newspaper with Arthur sitting beside reading one of his medical documents on the topic of cancer and Clawdia in the doctor's lap. It was 10 am already and normally John would be at work dealing with his first or second patient of the day ,fortunately for John , he didn't have to go to work today. 

Putting down the newspaper, he looked over to Arthur 

"" Hey Arthur, I'm going to Tesco to get some grocery. Would you like to go with me, lad? "" 

"" Can I ? "" Arthur asked, not used to being able to go anywhere far from home. Mother said that she couldn't bear being seen with him

"" Of course lad "" John chuckled, letting Clawdia jump off his lap before standing up to grab his overcoat. 

Entering the dairy aisle, John picked up three bottles of milk and rested them in the basket before getting every else that they needed. Bread, butter, vegetables, pasta, rice, some chicken breasts,.. 

Turning over and seeing Arthur eyeing the candy aisles

"" Arthur, time to go, lad ""

"" O-okay, Mr John ""

Exiting the shop, John reached in one of the plastic grocery bags

"" Here, lad "" He said, letting the chocolate bar land in Arthur's hands

A look of confusion appeared on his freckled face. 

"" Consider it a little treat for all the help with the meals these past few days"" 

Having walked for a few minutes, John noticed that a certain slick black car had been following them for a while now. Wanting to confirm his suspicious, he glanced back at the car. 

' Oh bloody course ' he thought, recognize the iconic design of the car sent by the Ice Man himself. 

As the car got closer to them on the empty street

' Prefect place to kidnap someone ' acknowledged John. He wasn't going to get involved in any of this. 

Holding Arthur's hand tighter in fear of getting the boy involved whatever that the government usually encountered, John picked up his pace and consequently Arthur's. 

"" Mr John- he wheezed at first, a bit confused but catching a glimpse of the car approaching them closer by the passing second made him realize at least part of the reason why John was suddenly anxious to get home. 

They were being followed. 

As they were about to enter a busy street in hope of losing sight of the car, a voice caught their attention. 

"" JOHN, LISTEN TO US "" It was Anthea- well at least that was what she wanted John to refer to her as, with her head poking out of the car. 

"" So the bloody British Government is so lazy that he can't even oversee a kidnapping committed in his personal interest "" retaliated John, turning around to get a good look at his supposed kidnapper. ( or kidnappers - after all Mycroft's minions never worked alone) 

The hard, stoic glare he had was mixed with a bit of confusion after witnessing the assistant's expression who actually looked...................................................................... worried and a bit shocked 

' It's a trick ' his brain shouted 

"" I'm not getting in the car "" John stood his ground, awaiting for the next persuasion from the assistant, putting himself in front of Arthur, who was clinging onto John's forearm,to create a barrier between the boy and the car. 

"" John, please just listen to us. I beg of you "" Anthea pleaded, still wearing a distraught expression. Either what she had to say was true or she was a damn excellent actress. 

' Or it could be neither and I'm just a damn fucking idiot ' John reprimanded himself

Ignoring the sharp sting that emitted from his forearm due to Arthur's clinging ( it wasn't the boy's fault anyway. Only John's) , John was about to open his mouth to tell Anthea to fuck off and leave them alone. 

"" Please, John. This concerns Sherlock "" 

That line made John freeze, every single muscle of his suddenly forgetting how to relax. 

"" H-has his name finally been cleared? "" He asked, not vocalising what he really wanted to ask

Anthea shook her head sadly "" No, we're still looking into it. But I beg you, John,just get in the car "" . A hint of desperation could be detected in her voice. 

John considered for a moment, before glancing back at the young boy currently in his care. 

"" No."" He said sternly "" I'm not getting Arthur involved in whatever you government officials do "", a vague gesture of his hand was added to emphasize his point. 

"" Please, John. It's a matter of utmost importance to Mycroft"" 

Covering his face with his free hand, he took one last look at Arthur, who simply wore a look of confusion but otherwise no visible signs of fear. 

Cursing under his breath, he finally gave in. 

"" Fine but if anything happens to Arthur here, I swear to all the holy deities in the bloody universe, I will strangle all of you tossers with my bare hands "" Threatened John as he and Arthur got escorted into the fancy black as night car. 

"" Thank you, John "" breathed Anthea before ordering the driver to keep driving. 

"" Mr John--Arthur said, finally managing to get back his voice -- Who are they? "" 

John let out a long sigh of exhaustion. Where would he even begin. 

"" People sent by a nosy, overprotective government official"" John informed before pulling Arthur into a hug to ease off some of his anxiety

"" Don't worry, lad. I won't let them hurt you "" John reassured, thankful that he still kept his gun close to him today 

' Thank god for oversized jumpers ' he thought, reaching down his waist to catch a feel of the butt of the gun. 

Arriving at Mycroft's manor , they were let off and escorted to his royal Umbrella himself. 

' Posh git ' thought John as he took in the fancy decor of the manor. He admitted that it was beautiful and elegant but personally it was a bit too flamboyant for his taste. Then again the Holmes brothers were known for being drama queens. 

He swore if there was a sniper awaiting their arrival at the end of the escort, he would find Mycroft and murder him using the man's precious umbrella. It didn't matter if John would make it out alive or not, he was still going to murder that bastard. 

"" Mr Holmes awaits you, Dr Watson"" The escort said, opening the fancy carved wooden door to reveal none other than Mycroft Holmes himself , sitting in his designated chair, with a "" Don't be afraid, be terrified "" look on his thin face. 

' Look like the tosser hasn't slept in days ' John noted, taking in the man's heavy bags and haggard face,usually the doctor in him would rise to the occasion but he couldn't exactly muster a care now. 

"" What's it now, Mycroft? Oh let me guess. You're going to kill me to erase every evidence of Sherlock's suicide. If it is then just do it you fucking bastard. Just leave the kid alone. He isn't involved in this, you heartless tosser "" John spat, signalling Arthur to get behind him. He knew he wasn't making much sense now but honestly he could care less. 

"" Rest assured, John. I won't do such a thing. It would be like going against my dear brother's wish-- John rolled his eyes -- This is a difficult time for you. I understand why you would hold such animosity for me. I truly love my brother, there is simply no doubt about it. I devoted a great majority of my time to making sure of his well-being-- His voice stiffened for a moment before continuing-- Yet I am partially to blame for his........ permanent departure from us. However, I understand that your companionship with him, though shorter than the number of years I spent knowing him, was more directly emotional than my fraternal, and somewhat paternal, affection for Sherlock. Whatever turmoil I am suffering now is only a fraction of yours"" 

John struggled to stop the burning of his eyes and the lump in his throat. 

"" Now you're just pulling my leg. Look. If you're going to start getting sentimental about his death then you should have done so during his funeral. If this is all you're going to do now then excuse us but we're leaving"" John said, holding Arthur's hand gently , ready to guide him and himself to the exit. 

"" WAIT, DR WATSON "" shouted Mycroft, "" This isn't what I had you come here for. Like my assistant has informed you, this matter concerns Sherlock ""

"" Unless it's about his name being cleared, I don't want to hear it. Damn sake, Mycroft, I have a child in my care "" 

"" Why yes I can see that, as a matter of fact he is why we're having this discussion "" Mycroft said, glancing at Arthur hiding behind John, like a scared duckling hiding behind momma duck, only that this duck wasn't scared but rather upset and angry, with a clear grimace plastered on his face. 

Clearing his throat, Mycroft continued:"" You see, John, before meeting you and consequently getting back on his track, my brother did some unsavoury deeds, many of which are kept as secrets shared only between us. Since your arrival, I am sure you have heard a good deal of said secrets. However, I am afraid that there are some deeds with serious consequences that I was unaware of and , thus, couldn't take action in time--

"" Oh just get to the point, you twat "" John snapped, patience wearing thin with every passing moment spent listening to him. 

"" I believe that in cases like this, seeing is preferably better than hearing"" The government official responded, unfazed, before reaching into his drawer to pull out a file and handing it to John, who looked at it suspiciously, as if there was going to be a bomb popping out 

Opening up the file , it was revealed to be a DNA result, in particularly, a paternity one. John traced over the information ( just all the standard conclusions of a DNA test)before his eyes landed on this one particular part. 


Child : Arthur Miller



Alleged Father : Sherlock Holmes 



Probability of Paternity= 99.999%


The floor seemed to shake and come to a stop simultaneously the moment the two blonds got hold of the information. It all made sense now, it was a truth John had been denying for the past days .Suddenly, for once, John was dead on correct and he wished he hadn't been. Looking at Arthur, all he could see was Sherlock's face. 

Honestly if the high-functioning sociopathic bastard was still alive now, John would probably kill him with his bare hands and then use his gun to shoot the bastard's face off. 

And for once in the history of being inconsiderate to other's feelings, his royal  Microsoft, oh great powerhouse of Great Britain actually and graciously gave the two of them time to process the shock. 

After a few minutes, Mycroft continued with the discussion

"" As you can see, it seems that my brother, Sherlock ,made yet another mistake during his drug-ridden foolish years ""

' Mistake'. Oh how that word made Arthur want to rip out the man's throat, if only he could get close enough and dip his pocket knife deep in his throat, ripping out the windpipe.

 ' well hello there violent thought . Glad to see you're up ' he thought. 

Clutching the DNA results in his hand, John felt like he was being torn in two different directions. Adding to the already as complicated as a twelfth grade geometric equation feelings he harboured for the detective was anger and a hint-- NO a fuck ton of disappointment towards how careless and bloody irresponsible Sherlock had been. 

HELL WHY SHOULDN'T HE? The tosser's action led to a child, a living being with emotions and feelings, being born in a loveless household. It amazed John how the boy even survived to this day to find out about his sperm donor of a father who was never in the picture and never would be because he was dead now, buried six feet underground with his name being tainted by rumours and quick arse conclusions. What kind of kid deserved this? 

He hoped --no prayed that Sherlock hadn't been aware of the existence of Arthur during his time of living. Because if the wanker had and had chosen not to do anything for his child then John really had to consider his sense of judgement and his taste in potential love interests. 

' Maybe I should scratch the ""potential"" part out ' echoed John's mind

"" John, as much as I know that this news is rather................................ jarring. I myself was also taken aback by the result. Never thought there would a day that I would become an uncle, at least from a genetic standpoint. But we must move forward to other matters, in particularly Arthur's accommodation . Now I don't think you would mind introducing me to my nephew "" Mycroft said, looking at Arthur( who was staring right back at him with those those big round eyes of his, unlike the Holmes brothers' cat-like ones) his glaze suddenly softened , as if reminiscing of a simpler time and the imagine of a once small exquisite child. 

"" I do have to say, he is much more well-behaved than my brother was when he was young "" Crouching his ridiculously tall frame down, finally able to take a good look at his newly discovered nephew. 

"" This is truly ironic "" He added in a whisper, almost wearing a sad smile, noticing Arthur's hair ( a sandy shade of blond similar to John's) and nose ( small, round ( just like John's) , giving his face a more good-natured appearance rather than the sharp and ethereal one of his father and uncle)

Would he even see them as such? 

' Eleven years ' that was how long Mycroft had remained ignorant of his existence. Frankly, even he ( as arrogant and prideful of a Holmes he was ) had to admit that all of this was unexpected and shocking to say the least. Trailing his eyes down to Arthur's clothes( old, worn and simply didn't fit him), he noticed some tell-tale signs of the boy's rather unhappy home life. 

' That simply won't do ' he made a tsking sound in his throat. 

' Never thought he would  do something so reckless like this, even taking into account his drug addiction at the time ' he thought sadly, a bit of disappointment on his face 

Unfortunately, in Arthur's eyes, the disappointment was directed at him, the mistake that should never have happened, a drug baby whose existence only came to be because of two individuals' horniness and carelessness, a creature that was well on the way of getting rejected by his sperm donor 's side of the family. 

' At least I can figure a way to survive in an orphanage or in foster care. Well it was nice knowing Mr John' he thought melancholically, accepting his fate. What else could he, a powerless child with no rights, do? 

"" I will arrange for all the essentials for him to be sent to you "" Mycroft said, breaking the silence. 

"" W-what? "" John inquired, honestly expecting less of the government official. Maybe he really did have a heart under all that ice and fancy suits. 

"" All the financial support and materials for him to grow up, of course. With you as his guardian"", elaborated the umbrella carrying man. 

"" Yeah I get that, Mycroft, but why me? "" John asked, already having deemed himself as unqualified. 

Arthur hoped John wasn't hinting at the fact that he disliked being with him. 

"" I am afraid I will be unavailable to take up that position for the upcoming period. You see, John, the government has caught wind of my breaching information about Sherlock's suicide, I will soon be up for an examination. Should I prove to be more of an inconvenience than an asset, I will be terminated "" He answered, taking in John's look and what he was thinking. 

"" It is exactly what you think, John. To make this matter worse, every individual, no matter what age, that is involved will also be dealt with, leaving no trace whatsoever. That's why I can't take Arthur under my wing "" 

John's face paled and twisted in disgust

"" You heartless bastards would murder an innocent child? ""

"" Unfortunately, that how things work in my profession "" said Mycroft sadly, his eyes slowly looking down. 

"" I acknowledge that it's a hard favour to ask of you but if you can't do it for me then at least do it for Sherlock's child "", pleaded the Ice Man

' He isn't just Sherlock's child . He's more than that' thought John

"" I will do it "" He replied determinedly, not too keen on the idea of an innocent life being taken . 

"" Thank you John. You must know that I, by and large, don't want to put my newly discovered nephew in harm way. I have already lost my brother, I can't make the same mistake again. "" 

"" I know, Mycroft "" was John's only response. 

Before he could stand up right and walk back to Arthur, he heard a small whisper from the government official 

"" You might want to do a check up on the boy, John"" 

Before he could demand a further explanation, the two of them were already in the process of being escorted back to John's- well their home. 

"" Well Mrs Hudson is going to be baffled "" said John as they returned to Baker Street, with a great piece of news to tell the landlady and the fact that Arthur was going to stay here longer than initially intended. 

' What has my life come to? ' he said, flopping himself down to the sofa. 

"" Hey lad, you're alright? You have been a little tad quiet "" John asked, concerned about the fact Arthur had been non-verbal through their entire trip home. 

It took a moment for John's question to register in Arthur's mind

"" I-i just didn't think I would ever find out sperm donor-- no father's identity, let alone his death. "" He said, with his legs pulled up to his chest and his arms wrapped around them, too uncomfortable to even say the word ""father"" without feeling repulsed yet he still pulled through with the intention of not making John upset,clutching his hair in an attempt to make sense of something, anything. It was like the fabric of reality was collapsing in front of him. He wished he hadn't seen Sherlock's picture, at first he was puzzled as to why the two of them looked similar , but now , knowing the truth,he couldn't look into the mirror without the thought of becoming like him plaguing his already messed up mind. 

What if they're just keeping you to fill his place? A Sherlock Junior? 

That thought haunted him. He could already feel another the urge to peel away his face in order not to look like him. 

' Maybe if I pull out my eyes, I won't have to deal with this ' thought Arthur darkly, deeming his issues as messed up and ridiculous. Normal kids didn't have these thoughts poking at their minds, tearing them apart and yet still leaving enough for them to acknowledge how fucked up they were. 

"" You don't have to call him that if you are uncomfortable to do it, Arthur"" assured John softy, feeling the tension in the boy's voice. 

"" B-but you love him, don't you? Disrespecting him means disrespecting you "" whispered Arthur, not even understanding his own emotions.  He hated, resented the sperm donor for years, maybe even all of his life. He hated how he existed because of him, hated the fact he was messed up because of them. He hated the fact he was nothing but an accident, a mistake made in the high heat of the moment by two individuals who weren't in their right bloody mind. 

' Why couldn't the egg donor just have a damn abortion back then? Did she really want to see me suffer? ' lamented Arthur, thinking how easy it would be to just wrap his hands around his own neck and squeeze hard. It would hurt but the pain would be worth it in his mind. After all the pain, there would only be silence, a forever state of slumber. He frankly thought it was tempting

John stopped for a moment. Was his love for Sherlock that obvious? He always thought of Sherlock as not being interested in sex or romance, but now the proof of how Sherlock had been completely able to get it on just fine was sitting right before his eyes . 

' Idiot, it was just a scratching of a biological itch to him. He didn't love anyone. Even if he had, that person wouldn't have been you ' his brain reprimanded him. 

' No  this isn't about me .This is about Arthur ' decided John , mentally punching himself for being so self centered. After all  he was nothing but a puppy following the genius ,stroking his ego with praises and making him feel so superior to others. 


That was all he had been, no more no less


"" Come here ,lad-- he said  pulling Arthur into a hug , letting the boy cry all over his shoulder, -- it's okay, everything will be fine, I promise. What's in the past is in the past, I know it's a lot to take in. But there's no need to worry , as your guardian, I will help you through it ""

' But then who will help you ,Mr John ? "" thought Arthur, whose throat was too clogged up with all the crying and hiccuping to voice out his thought. 

 

 

I am back, my darling, please let me know what you think of the latest chapter.

 

For the sake of confidentiality and protection of Arthur, for the time being ( at least until the news about Sherlock's suicide died down), the news wasn't disclosed to anyone( otherwise the poor boy would be bombarded by the press within hours) ,aside from John, Lestrade( due to him being the one to suggest the DNA exam)and Mrs Hudson. 

Speaking of telling Mrs Hudson the news. 

The next morning was when all the stuff needed to take care of a child that Mycroft had arranged for was sent to the flat. There were clothes, study equipment, toothbrush, footwear, books, even toys such as a teddy bear and among many other things that John thought was simply too much. He wasn't even sure that all these would fit in the flat without removing some of his own things.............................................. or Sherlock's. 

' The wanker really thought it through ' John facepalmed, a bit amazed at how fast the transition was. 

' It's like he expected all of this and prepared in advance, although it's more likely that he just had a bunch of people buy everything at the child section of the mall. ' 

Before John was able to think further into the working mechanic of bloody Mycroft Holmes, he was met with a confused squeal. Walking upstairs taking two steps at a time, he was soon greeted with the appearance of Mrs Hudson, who were trying to nudge through the crowd of Mycroft's minions while wearing a puzzled expression as to why there were people carrying boxes among boxes of things into John's flat. The other tenants were equally baffled, whispering to each other and asking what was with all the people wearing all black entering John's flat while carrying boxes. Honestly to the outsider's view, it looked like a bloody FBI raid or rather aid in this case ( complete with people wearing all blacks and covering their faces with masks). 

Delivering the news to Mrs Hudson was.........., in a way, like reliving the shock for John. 

At first, Mrs Hudson thought it was a prank ( oh how John wished ) but one look at John's expression and the recollection of Sherlock's history had her no longer doubtful. To make sure of getting rid of any lingering doubt the kind landlady might still cling to, he produced the daunting DNA result, now wrinkled due to him squeezing it in his trance , from his drawer and handed it to her. 

"" Oh poor thing - she exclaimed, raising her hand to cover her agape mouth, with which John could only silently agree - First abandoned by his mother and now he found out his father is dead. Oh if Sherlock were still alive and I could find that nasty woman, I would strangle them both "" She continued in a hiss, angry at the sweet boy's misfortune.

"" Oh you and me both ,Mrs H "" John replied, waiting for the crowd of people to be done with their job so he could proceed with his mundane routine. He hoped the people wouldn't bother Arthur who was in the living room playing with Clawdia last time he saw him, which was only 10 minutes before all this aid came in. 

After all the ruckus, John was glad to see the backs of Mycroft's people. Entering the flat, he first saw Arthur sitting on sofa with Clawdia sitting contentedly on the top of his curly head. John felt an amused grin creep up on his face. 

"" The people were moving around and she got scared so I let her rest on my head "" Arthur explained, feeling the feline jumping off his head to resume her daily mischief, before starting to stare off into the distance again. 

' The lad really has got a staring problem'

"" So- how are you taking this, lad? ""John asked, not exactly expecting an answer. The kid was doing significantly better than he imagined. Not everyone could stay calm after being abandoned by their mother and then discovering that their father was dead through their government official of an uncle, at least that was what they were to him biologically. But being biologically linked doesn't always ensure a close bond

"" Better than the standard kids my age, I guess "" He replied bluntly, before looking down, looking he had to ask something but was too afraid to do so.

' Fingers fidgeting in an attempt to get hold of something,eye slightly twitching, legs shifting in discomfort. ' the doctor noted. 

"" Ok, out with it,Arthur "" John said, crossing his arms, his face soft but firm. He wasn't going let the kid bottle up his emotions just like Sherlock. 

' You think he had emotions. You are pathetic ' John quickly shoved that into his chamber of unwanted emotions, adding more locks and chains to further ensure its entrapment. He didn't have the sanity to deal with this for the time being 

"" W-what? "" Arthur responded in a defensive tone, fingers curling together, eyes staring piercingly, just like Sherlock when he had been in one of his dark moods. 

John sighed at the resemblance. 

' Not now, you bloody loony ' he thought, reprimanding himself. He could almost hear the tone Sherlock used when insulting him. 


  You're an idiot, John  


' Dear god, maybe in my next session, Ella will put me in the psych ward if I disclose this to her. Next thing I know, I may be wearing a straitjacket and locked in a padded cell ' he lamented, a bit torn between telling or not telling his therapist about his vivid hallucinations. The first time he had told her, she had advised him some methods and tricks to get rid of the visions. And they had worked .............................................................. for a while before the visions had gotten more vivid and more convincing. It was unbearable, everyday waking up and being expected to act like you're still okay in the head when you are clearly not. At this point, he might as well be considered clinically insane and depressed. In spite of the desperate attempt at humour,John feared one day he might believe them, the dreaded visions of Sherlock that were always telling him how much he meant to the detective and that with just one pull of the trigger, they would be together again, as if no one had never left. 

' Oh never mind with these thoughts and visions, I have a child to take care of ' 

Once again repressing his emotions, John cleared his throat before speaking in a soft voice. 

"" Arthur, I know you want to ask me something. It's okay to do so, you have the right to know about him"" He said, expecting the boy to inquire information about his biological father. No matter how much the boy resented his parents ( which was understandable, taking into account his circumstances), he must be interested in knowing what kind of person Sherlock had been during his living time, maybe in order to validate or invalidate his resentment towards the dead. 

It was like an eternity had passed when Arthur decided to speak. 

"" I don't want to make you upset. "" He said, before lowering his head down

"" This is ridiculous, utterly ridiculous"" said the boy in whisper.

John was a bit taken aback. "" W-what? ""

"" Six days, not counting today, that was how long you have known me and I have known you, Mr John. It's hardly enough time for anyone to form attachments to anyone and yet you have done nothing but showed me kindness. I just don't understand, I can't comprehend why you would do this. You even helped me take care of a stray cat I found. - He slowly reached for his face, the one that he was slowly growing to hate, despite knowing how illogical it was to do so ( Am I that insane and illogical ?) - Is it because I look like him that you treat me so well. You think I am going to become like h-him, don't you? That I will become a Sherlock Junior."" His hands were starting to shake and move like he was trying choke something. Why was it that he cared so much about making John upset? 

' Nice job, stupid. Now he will truly think you're fucked up, you soon-to-be-serial-killer' 

"" I don't want to become like him. I don't want to become like either of them "" Pictures of white powder, colourful pills contained within bottles and the rattling of the containers of alcoholic drink were bombarding his senses. Why couldn't he be a normal kid with a happy home life? Why was he so sacred of becoming like his parents? What if his father wasn't so bad and he was disrespecting him in front of the person who loved him? 

He was going to get into trouble

' Maybe I am just being a lunatic, there are other kids who have had it worse than me. So why am I like this? Why am I such a freak, a weirdo, a mistake?'

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"" Just forget it, please Mr John"" Arthur suddenly said, standing up to walk to his room- well it was John's but it was being used as Arthur's for the time being. It was an attempt to shut off the conversation to avoid spilling out bottled feelings. 

Reaching out to hold Arthur's arm, to hold him  back from furthering his plan of bottling his feelings ( he couldn't let him do that, not after Sherlock ), he was surprised to receive a sharp hiss of pain coming from Arthur, who was trying hard not to let John know but did a rather poor job hiding the pained expression painted on his face 


You might want to do a check up on the boy, John


' It can't be ' he thought  despite knowing how absurdly likely it was for this to be true. 

He quickly brought Arthur closer, pulling up the sleeves of his oversized shirt ,in spite of the boy's protest. His stomach dropped like a large boulder sitting on top of an unstable platform when the sight of the bruises and cuts littered on both of Arthur's arm caught his attention ( greenish brown, happened about a week prior ,showing signs of healing but seem to still cause him pain ). Some of the bruises were in shape of a hand, a woman's to be precise. John hurried checked the boy's torso, only to discover that it was in similar state. There were signs of healing but risk of infections was not negligible. 

"" Sit down now Arthur "" John said, pulling the boy toward the sofa, before going to fetch the med kit. Arthur only silently obliged. 

"" You should have told me earlier, lad. "" He continued upon returning. "" It may be a little painful. Bear with it a bit, okay? "", bringing up a ball of cotton soaked in disinfectant to more recent wounds. Arthur hissed at the contact but remained well-behaved nonetheless. 

"" Don't worry, it will soon pass "" reassured John, doctor mode activating. After cleaning all the wounds properly and applying medicine to them, he moved on to his torso. 

' No broken ribs ' relieved John

 

 

Arthur's torso had suffered some wounds, similar to his arms, but thankful none of his ribs were broken, although there were some cuts and scratches that needed to be cleaned and bandaged to prevent future infections. Tracing his fingers across the boy's torso, John was a bit horrified to how malnourished he was ( not to the point of ribs poking out but he was close). John was glad that his mother had abandoned him sooner than later. He wondered how much longer Arthur would have survived if he had still been in his mother's care. The image of an emaciated Arthur on the verge of being beaten to death flashed before his eyes but he quickly shook it off, resuming his task of tending the very much alive and on the way of getting better boy before him. 
"" There ya go - John said, finally finishing patching Arthur up - the injuries should heal in about a week or so"", he added before putting away the med kit.
"" Usually it takes me only 5 days more to heal from this "" Arthur said, admiring the skillful wrapping of the bandages around his torso. ' As expected of a military doctor ' he thought, wondering if he could master this given enough time. Maybe John could teach him?
""U- usually? "" John breathed, sad to know that this had been such a daily occurrence to Arthur that he would simply disclose it without a bat of an eye.
' But then why was he so insistent on not letting me check on him? Oh , of course subconscious reflexes ' John thought
"" I can stop spilling these details out if you feel uncomfortable, Mr John"", offered Arthur, noticing the sudden silence from John. It would be awkward to keep creating this tension between the two of them. Might lead to difficulties in their cohabitation.
John quickly declined the offer.
"" No, you don't have to, Arthur. It's okay. I was just-
"" Feeling sad about my condition? "" He inquired
"" Well yes - John trailed off, having trouble trying to find the right way to say - but I also admire how strong you are""
A look of confusion flashed onto Arthur's face.
"" How can a child like me be strong? --He said, tilting his head to the side and gesturing at John's shoulders-- I don't even want any defined muscles like you. I can barely lift anything more than 20 pounds "" 

John let out a light chuckle, sitting down on the sofa beside Arthur. 

"" Lad, strength isn't just about the physical kind, strength can be about how mentally resilient you are. The ability to go through something terrifying and still come out strong is admirable and not a trait that everyone has. ""

"" But I didn't come out strong. I came out unstable and illogical "" Arthur said, staring at his hands, remembering all his thoughts about how it would feel to strangle the people he hated( oh how he carved to see their faces twisted in anguish), namely his mother. 

"" Trauma can be a bitch,you aren't at fault for what happened to you. Anyone would be a bit messed up after what you have been through, of course it doesn't excuse any potential detestable actions in the future but you shouldn't be too harsh on yourself,lad. What's in the past is in the past. It's maybe hard to move on but don't worry, you'll have me alongside you--"" John said, pulling Arthur face to face with him--"" And you're not like him, Arthur. Just because you're his son biologically doesn't mean you're bound to grow up like him. --""

"" B-but--

"" No but, Arthur. You're not bad, lad. Hell, I think you're more compassionate than most kids I know. You risked getting hurt just to save a stray cat. You care about my feelings.These things aren't actions that Sherlock would have done when he was alive. Believe me when I say you are not like him. And don't worry if you feel more comfortable calling him ""sperm donor "". After all he isn't here anymore to hear it "" He added, guessing that Arthur probably felt more better if he could feel a sense of dissociation when it came to his relation to Sherlock. He didn't blame him. Even he himself didn't think Sherlock would have been a good parent, especially in his druggie years. The man after all had seen all sentiments and emotions to be beneath him, scoffing at the sheer sight of anyone catching any hope of forming a bond with him. John's heart cracked a little more at that fact (? ) but he would rather face the truth as soon as possible and get this over. Right now someone needed him. 

"" B-but you love him, don't you? Why would you bear my disrespecting him? ""

"" It's complicated. Arthur. I will tell you another day when I am ready "" John let out a sad smile. 

Despite feeling a bit impatient  , Arthur knew not to press forward on the matter. He knew what it feels like for someone to keep pressuring you to tell things you're not comfortable telling. It's a weight is on your chest and your ears are ringing with sound of "" Tell me! Tell me! You're being difficult. Why are you so dramatic? "".The ringing won't stop no matter how hard you try,it won't cease until you break down crying and they accuse you of being emotional and then laugh at you or accuse you of being the one who is mean when you decide enough is enough and lash out. 

' Thankfully that took place outside of school. I can't risk my record being tainted ' Arthur thought, vividly remembering how much he yearned to tackled those kids to the ground and sink his knife into them.

' But then did them really deserve that? ' he thought again, knowing fully well those kids hadn't known any better. Not like everyone had endured traumas and forced to mature quickly like him. Nonetheless the thoughts still persisted, filling his head with increasingly dark ideas, whenever they were about ending his or others' life. 

Returning to reality, Arthur asked "" But you will tell me one day right, Mr John? "" , to be on the safe side. He needed all the information to validate his feelings and to distinguish which were his trauma-induced ones and which were not. 

"" Of course, lad. You have the right to know who he was. But maybe not now, it can be a lot to take in. How about we talk about something else for now? ""

John really didn't know if he was saying that for Arthur's sake or his. Maybe both? 

"" Can you teach me how to bandage wounds? It would be a useful skill later on in my life "" Arthur requested. He had always been interested in the medical field. There are simply so much usefulness in knowing these knowledge. He couldn't comprehend why more people didn't care to learn more about medicine. The information could save their lives one day. 

"" Of course, lad "" John smiled, grabbing a roll of elastic bandage. 

"" Now put your hand forward. The first lesson will be about the basic first : how to bandage an injured hand. I will make an example and then you try to replicate it , okay? ""

"" Okay, Mr John ""

The first time wasn't prefect, like at all. And Arthur was a bit disappointed ( am I that incompetent? ) .

""It's okay, Arthur. First time is never the charm. It's okay to make mistakes. Let's try again "" John reassures him, unrolling the clumsy bandage from his own hand. In spite of that, the boy's expression was still a bit sour 

"" I will let you in on a secret lad. When I first tried to learn how to bandage, I accidentally bandaged my hand so tight that I couldn't get it to unwrap for nearly half an hour. ""

"" Really? ""

"" Yep, I nearly tripped myself trying to unwrap it in a hurry""

A muffled huff could be heard from Arthur. John reconsidered this a mission accomplished. 

"" Okay, now, let's get going with our lesson. Time doesn't wait for anyone"" He said, ruffling Arthur's blonde hair. "" Remember to pull just tight enough and make sure the bandage is secured -....... 

The next morning, Lestrade decided that it was time to pay a visit. 

"" Oh hello Lestrade "" John greeted

"" Just call me Greg, John. I am not on duty right now "", Greg said, entering the flat and turning his head around

"" He's fine, mate "" John replied, noticing his friend's actions. 

"" O-oh yeah, thanks, I was just-  ""

"" Worried? Shocked? Yeah I know, not everyday you discover that a sociopathic consulting detective has a lovechild. "" John said, putting the kettle on the stove. He needed his morning cup of tea. "" Honestly Greg,I wouldn't have thought that just because of his appearance that you would urged a bloody DNA test. "" 

Greg made an offended face

"" John, the kid literally walked into a crime scene guarded by official police officers and managed to sneak in without anyone noticing. Not only did he not get traumatized but he even stared at the corpses in fascination. And he even made a damn deduction. How was I supposed to NOT make a connection? --

"" True "", John said amusingly, pouring hot water into his mug of tea "" Would you like a cuppa too, Greg? ""

"" Yes, thank you -- But seriously when Arthur showed up out of nowhere, I nearly got a heart attack. I think that it was one of my crazy ideas. But when the result came --

"" Yeah I know, Greg, not everyday we discover that the late only consulting detective in the world has a lovechild ""

"" I know that he was low during those years but I never thought that he would do something this reckless. Oh bloody hell eleven years, John. Do you know how that can affect a child? ""

John nodded, having read a good deal of psychology books during his medical student years. He still did now. 

"" But he's strong, Greg. With enough help, I am sure he can overcome this""

' Unlike me '

"" If you think so, John. You're the one with good judgement "" Greg sighed. 

' I don't think so considering how I trusted Sherlock ' John thought sadly, remembering all the time he should have just given up on ever confessing his feelings, killed them off and thrown them off a river to rot into nothing. It would hurt but at least it wouldn't be as slow and agonizing as this. 

Catching a glimpse of his deranged replication of Sherlock, in his trench coat and suit,John turned his head away and shut his eyes but not before he saw the vision mouth"" I love you, John "" 

When he opened them, the vision was gone. 

' At least this time, the vision isn't such a dick.'

"" You okay, John? "" Greg asked 

""Yeah, just haven't woken from sleep yet. I have been sleeping on the sofa for the time being. Maybe I will move into Sherlock's room after this. My back have been killing me.""

Greg 's face turned into a sympathetic one. 

"" John, this must be hard for you, with no doubt. I, just, hope you will get better soon. In the meantime, I don't think it's time to rush anything "" 

"" Really? A currently sleep-deprived detective with blood shot eyes and a hair messy enough to rival a crow's nest is giving me advice on being healthy? "" John teased

"" Oi you arse, I just have too much cases on my plate these days. After this, I will probably sleep for a whole weekend "" 

"" Sleeping too much can cause harm, Greg ""

"" Whatever, doctor ""

"" Mr Lestrade "" 

It was not an exaggeration to say that Greg nearly jumped off the floor two feet from where he stood. 

"" Jesse Chris, Arthur. You scared me there ""the inspector said, wondering how the hell could a child move so quietly without making a sound. But then he did have Sherlock's genes 

""Sorry,i didn't mean to ""

' Well he is more polite than Sherlock '

"" It's okay,kid.Anyway what do you want to ask?"" ""How was the result of the case, Mr Lestrade? ""

"" Well you were right, Arthur, although we did find out that the attacker had actually planned this out beforehand. Too bad it didn't work according to plan for the bloke ""

"" But i was still right 90% , right? ""

"" Give or take, kid ""

"" YES "" Arthur said excitedly, doing a little happy dance of his own, which just involved tapping his feet on the floor to a make-up rhythm

She plants it on your lips and steps back as you both break out into giggles.

            'I want to kiss John too!' you hear a voice cry, and you turn and see that it's Simon, his lip trembling and his eyes watering. Bethany rolls her eyes at the sight and you laugh louder before grabbing his hand, small but still bigger than yours, and pull him close.

'Here, Simon,' you say as you place a kiss on his trembling lips, watching as Simon's eyes and smile grow wide and Bethany's giggles grow shrill, her plaits swinging as she doubles over.

The bubble of childhood innocence bursts as you feel a hand - much, much bigger than your own this time - grasping your arm, pulling you from your reverie. Bethany quiets instantly, and the tears reappear in Simon's eyes.

You spend the next hour in the headmaster's office, his droning voice teaching you what's appropriate for a young man to do. You're not a young man, you think, you're five, but you say nothing until your dad arrives to pick you up. His blue eyes are cold, and you make sure you stay quiet.

Tears well over as your dad shouts himself hoarse on the car ride home and he gets even louder when he spots them trailing down your cheeks. You're disgusting, he says, a shameful poof, and where did he go wrong in life to have a pansy son? You don't know what these words mean yet, not really, but you will soon and you can feel an anger settling in under your skin, a vibrating mess that you itch to let out.

The next day at school you push Simon to the floor when he asks you to play, and you look the other way when you see his expression of betrayal, heartbroken.

You wish it were yesterday, when you were both laughing so hard your ribs ached.

 

You're eighteen years old and holding your acceptance letter into King's College whilst trying to ignore the way Harry's shouting is getting louder and higher, the way it does when she's truly distressed. The paper is thick between your fingers, probably the best quality paper you've ever touched, and you brush your fingers over where your name is printed. Mr John Watson.

            You're going to turn that Mr into Dr even if it kills you.

            Harry's boots stomp down the stairs for the last time in this house and you wince as the front door slams against its hinges, your dad swinging it back open and shouting at Harry in the street. You put the letter on the bed and move to the window, shifting the drab net curtains to the side. Harry spots you and aims a quick, watery smile up at the window before slinging her stuffed rucksack over her shoulder and running to the car where her friend Emma is waiting. (You know they're more than friends, but you can't find the words to use for the way Harry's cocky grin turns shy when she talks about her, and your heart jumps into your throat when you go to ask. It's only later that it becomes easier to call them girlfriends, and it only happens when you've moved into dorms.)

            'Bye, Harry,' you say to the banged-up Ford as Harry pulls the door shut.

            Your dad stays in the street, still shouting, until the car squeals out of the street, and you find yourself mirroring his squared shoulders and clenched fists and feel bile rise to the back of your throat. It's good Harry got out and it's about time somebody did, but you can't help but feel a little betrayed that she left you here with him. You turn and your gaze falls to the letter on the bed, the back type and cream paper stark against the greying sheets.

You won't be here for much longer, and you won't be coming back.

 

At twenty-five, the roiling pot of anger inside you has quieted to a simmer, too exhausted from ward placements and essays to feel anything other than a fatigue that's only kept from consuming you by a steady buzz of caffeine, thanks to the tea you drink.

            Your uni mates have already begun their plans to move cross-country, to their hometowns where they'll be pediatricians 'til they retire. You'll miss them, of course you will, but it's easier to breathe now you're getting closer to a time where you don't have to meticulously plan bathroom trips. You've done your best to avoid bumping into half-naked housemates in the hallway, their hair still dripping and towels slung low over angular hips, but it's getting harder to ignore the way your mouth goes dry when you laugh it off with them.

            You're not gay. A steady stream of girlfriends over the years has confirmed to you that, yes - you still like women. A lot. Your mind drifts back to memories of Siobhan's soft curves and small-but-wicked hands sometimes when you're in the hospital break room and your brain actually has a chance to slow down and think, and Kathy had been a good girlfriend for the three months that you went out. (It was the longest relationship you've had, but your head wasn't in it. It's been too busy with work and ignoring slurred voicemails from Harry.) So you don't understand why that can't be enough for you.

            You don't understand why you can't just be normal.

            Running through the corridors of the hospital keeps the questioning at bay, keeps it under the skin where it's happy to lie quiet, but you dread the day that your studies are over and you have to face the real world. There's no way you're following in your mates' footsteps, you'd rather gnaw off your leg than go home, but with no girlfriend and no specialty lined up - though you're good at emergency surgery, very good, with the steadiest hand that the rest of your placement envies - you're not sure what you want to do with the rest of your life. You've made something of yourself, and that's all you've ever wanted to prove, but there's no plan there.

            Which is why when the Army asks, you say yes, and you fall into the rush of St Bart's and eventually, Afghanistan.

            That's where it falls apart.

 

You're thirty-fucking-five and you can't keep still. The Foxhound's engine rumbles as you cross the desert, swaying in your seat as you ride over divots and craters in the dry earth. Some are probably natural formations. Others, you know, are all that remain of days and nights of endless bombings.

The squad sat with you in the back are your family now - good men and women that you stitch up and send off running again with a clap on the shoulder. You squint through the sunlight to look at Peter sat opposite to you, his legs wide and exuding confidence and familiarity. He looks at you and raises an eyebrow, smirking, and you lick your lips before looking to the horizon. It's not a good idea. But it's an idea, and you know that it's not just your own. You can feel the weight of his gaze lingering on your mouth before he turns to joke with Jackie. It's her you should fancy, she's all steel eyes and take-no-shit attitude, but there's something about Peter's chestnut skin deepening even more under the excruciatingly dry sun, stretching over his strong arms and lightening the hair there that you want.

'Heads up, check-point ahead,' Rocky says from the driver's seat through the hatch. You turn round to the window and see the weathered building no bigger than a shed and your hands clench in your lap, expectant. It's a familiar feeling nowadays, channeling the adrenaline your temper gifts you. It's - good. You think. It is what it is, anyway.

'Anybody want anything from the drive-thru?' Peter jokes with a grin, and Jackie punches his bicep whilst rolling her eyes, but her lips are twisting up reluctantly and so are yours.

You know something's wrong when there's a moment that's just too quiet, too still, and then your suspicions are confirmed when the car overturns.

Blood blurs your vision and there's a ringing in your ears that won't stop when you shout, 'Everyone okay?!'

You think you shout it, anyway, but you can't hear yourself nor anything else for that matter. You unbuckle your seatbelt with trembling hands and grunt when you slump upside down against the roof of the patrol car. Wiping the blood away from your eyes and quickly feeling for injury - it's superficial, a graze or split skin that's bleeding loads because that's what heads do - and you scan over the squad. Jackie's out cold but you can feel her pulse thrumming under the thin skin of her wrist when you reach over, Peter and Rocky are - God. Oh, God. The metal of the car is crumpled around them, half of Peter's head caved in like a deflated football.

You swallow the sick that fills your mouth back down, choking on it for a moment, and move to carefully unclip Jackie's seatbelt before the Foxhound's engine decides to explode. Her lean body slumps against you as you try to kick the back door open but your leg is weak, too weak, but the other one kicks fine when you try it and the doors fly open, the left half falling off its hinges as you move to drag Jackie out.

Your skin is thrumming and your ears are ringing and you barely even feel the bullet when it rips through your shoulder, sending you flying into the sand besides Jackie's unconscious body as you beg, 'Please, God, let me live.'

 

You're thirty-six, chasing a mad genius across London on the daily and you know that you're screwed.

            Life with Sherlock is... consuming. He's mental, and amazing, rude but sometimes sweet and an absolute cock at times. You can't get enough of him and it terrifies you. You were lost from the moment you laid eyes on him, his dark curls farming frankly ridiculous cheekbones and a voice like heavy velvet. It was exhilarating; he was exhilarating, with just a hint of danger that you could feel pulling you in, magnetic.

            The high you get from solving a case with him electrifies you, hums in your fingertips that ache to pull him down into you as he stands beside you (too close, he's always too close god you wish he'd never move) and your chests heave as your eyes meet, and you know you aren't imagining that there's something there begging to happen.

            It's familiar though, too, and your mind flicks images of Simon and Peter behind your eyelids, and you move away eventually because Sherlock never moves first. You wish he would, just once, but then again you aren't sure whether you'd want him to lean in or look away.

            You're not gay, though, and you prove it by dating a string of women that you can't remember the details of and fucking away the image of Sherlock's wiry frame spread out across sheets. No girlfriend deserves to be strung along by a man who doesn't know what he wants, though, so you give it up eventually and try not to wallow in the guilt.

At this point it's just instinct to deny it.

'I'm not actually gay,' you say to the woman, Irene, before she blows your mind.

'Well I am,' she says, smirking at your confusion, 'look at us both.'

And that's when it hits you that other people feel the same way you do, that you're allowed to want men whilst liking women, too. (You'd heard of bisexuality before, obviously, but that had been - background information. You'd never actually seen it in practice, never met somebody who feels the same way you do.) Of course it's The Woman that tells you this, and of course it's her that Sherlock actually wants.

Your fists clenches at your side, pushing down the tremor, and Irene looks at you in that 'I-see-everything' way that her and Sherlock do and she smiles in delight at getting a reaction out of you. You curse when you hear Sherlock's customised text-tone and Irene just smiles wider.

She dies and you can't fully quash the evil, jealous relief that swells inside.

Sherlock dies and you feel nothing again.

 

You're thirty-eight when Mary picks you up, dusts you off and makes you feel something closer to alive again. She's quick as a whip, though, and you predict the question before it comes.

            'So,' she starts, swirling wine in her glass as she leans over the table towards you, and the buzzing under your skin starts up, 'you and Sherlock. Were you...?'

            Mary lets the question hang, and you could deny it easily. She's giving you an easy out, but you owe it to her not to take it.

            'No, we weren't,' you say, taking a sip from your water glass that's shaking slightly in your hand.

            'But you wanted to,' she says, and it's then that you get the idea to marry her. Mary is beautiful, truly, her wide eyes glittering in the candlelight and her mouth stretched into a small but kind smile, and you take a moment to appreciate her before you speak.

            'Yes,' you admit, and it comes out breathy, punched out of you by the force of admitting something that you had pushed down for so long. You expect her to down the wine and leave the table to never return, but she doesn't. She puts down her glass and puts her hand over yours, resting them both on the table together.

            You pay the bill when it arrives and the next day you buy the ring.

            Then Sherlock keeps a promise you asked for at his grave and turns your world upside-down, in the way that only he can manage.

            You fight with yourself through the next year: through the traumatic reappearance of Sherlock, acting for all the world like he hadn't ripped your soul in two when he left. Through your wedding, sat between the two people that love you most and whom you aren't sure you love more. Through the discovery that Mary wasn't as perfect as you had imagined - she was more. Just like Sherlock was more.

Mary, though, gives you Rosie, who actually is perfect, and through the terror you swear to her that you'd be the father you wish you'd had.

You grit your teeth through it all and act like you aren't being pulled apart.

 

Pushing forty already feels like hell, your knees clicking when you move too quickly and your head throbbing the day after you have a single beer, but it feels even worse when Mary dies and the vibrating, simmering anger is let loose.

            You don't mean to aim it at Sherlock but it's so easy because none of this would have happened if he'd just done something, if he'd just taken you when you were available and wanting him so badly you ached with it.

            You still want him. You just want to hurt him too, and although it's not fair you can't control it.

            Punches are thrown and venomous words are spat out at the broken man you've loved since you met him, and you're so like your dad in that moment that it's only the thought of him being proud of you that slows your next punch. Rosie deserves somebody who is nothing like your dad was.

            So you get on with doing what's expected of you, like you always have. You save Sherlock's life because he's busy saving yours and you help him pull himself back together like the sight of him doesn't wake you want to scream what-ifs, like what if you'd kissed him that first night, or any of the other ones that you wanted to? What if you carried on limping away when Mike Stamford called your name?

            Instead, you confess your sins to Sherlock and let him hold you when the tears spring to your eyes. You duck your head down and away because dad had hated when you cried so much, but he just pulls you closer and you hate that you wish you were closer still.

            'It is what it is,' Sherlock says, softly. He's shaking from the withdrawal and you want to soothe, help or scream but he just strokes a hand over your hair and guides you through the breakdown that's been waiting almost forty years to happen.

            With each shuddering breath, you let yourself be the hurt one. You mourn Mary and the life she'd given you. You mourn the boy you never really got to be. You mourn for close to fifteen minutes, swaying with Sherlock on the worn carpet of 221B.

            'I have to get back to Rosie,' you say, your voice cracking somewhere in the middle.

            'Of course,' Sherlock says, but he doesn't let go instantly, his arms cradled around you for a lingering moment, 'Give her my love.'

            Your smile feels close to genuine when you look up into his open expression. 'I will.'

           

You're forty now. Forty today, in fact, and it feels - good.

            You smother Rosie with kisses throughout the day, basking in her gorgeous giggles and sass that no baby should ever have mastered (thanks, Mary's genes), before making the trip downstairs and dropping her into Mrs Hudson's arms for the evening.

            'You have a good birthday bash, John,' she says, winking and smiling more than she ever used to when you were dropping Rosie at her or Molly's door every day just to cope.

            'I plan to, Mrs Hudson,' you say, grinning at her laughter and placing one last kiss on Rosie's brow.

            You take the stairs back upstairs two at a time, eager to get into the living room where your friends are waiting. Lestrade is on the couch, telling a story of a difficult drugs bust and gesturing wildly at Sherlock, who is smirking at him and probably deduced where the drugs were hidden thirty seconds into the tirade. Lestrade gets up when he spots you at the door, cutting himself off and giving you a very-special-birthday-handshake.

            'Forty, mate,' Lestrade jokingly winces, and he pulls his hand back when you start to twist it round, laughing.

            'I've felt forty for a decade, it can't get much worse,' you say, before Molly walks into the room behind you and hands you a very lovely card.

            Sherlock passes you a beer, his fingers brushing yours as it's handed over, but you don't wince away from it this time. You thank him and look him in the eyes as he watches you take a long swig, before turning to greet Molly.

            There's cake at some point, supplied by Tesco's finest, and you blow the forty candles (Sherlock insisted on counting and placing them himself) out as quickly as you can lest the fire alarm goes off. You have three cold beers and by the time Lestrade and Molly leave you're sinking into your armchair comfortably.

            Sherlock is stood at the window, violin in hand but not playing, and you study the lines of his tall body, dressed in a fine maroon shirt and those damned black trousers.

            'You've decided, then,' he says suddenly, turning around to look at you, and you blink up at him.

            'Sorry?' You ask, but the tips of your fingers are beginning to tingle with what could be excitement.

            Sherlock moves over slowly, and you realise that he's completely sober. Thinking back on the night, you're not sure you ever saw him with a drink in his hand.

            'What you are,' Sherlock explains - and although you probably shouldn't, you know exactly what he's referring to. You swallow dryly before standing up from your armchair, facing him.

            'I'm bi,' you say, and you're proud of the way your voice only slightly wavers when you can practically hear your heart thundering in your ears.

            'Good,' Sherlock says, and you have a moment of confusion before you notice how close you're standing together, breathing the same air between you.

            He's waiting, you think, and you push up on the balls of your feet to press a kiss to his mouth. Sherlock presses back, and the hum beneath your skin falls silent.","['KayB90', 'Calais_Reno', 'sandra42', 'johnnyboyy', 'Mmarika', 'Moon_Ainsworth', 'orianamaia', 'RoseMartial', 'wwubd', 'Daybora', 'veowens', 'LHR_etc', 'Dee_Laundry', 'MargueriteSomebodyoranother', 'actualtrashrat', 'RuthRaven13', 'MehOolongTea']","['Nickkirk', 'orianamaia']"

I need you to tell me what do you think.' Sherlock's voice was coming from the bathroom, so John sighted and stand up.'Oh' he whispered in horror. Sherlock was standing there with his face covered in blood. The left eye was red with brow bleeding. The worst was the cut on his cheekbone - quite deep and about five centimeters long from his eye to the ear. 'What the hell happened?' John stepped into the bathroom stopped in shock.'I wanted to consult this cut with you. I suspect it needs stitches, but I believe I shouldn't do it myself.''Yeah, but Sherlock... what have you done? It's 9 AM, Saturday morning?!' John said while pulling out his emergency kit.'I told you I am going out.' He murmured and sat on the stool to make it easier for John to examine his injuries.'I thought you were going out to the store! Oh my god... Sherlock, you are so lucky. You might have lost your eye!''I didn't. I had everything under control.''Oh, Sherlock. I am so much worried about you.' John sighed but started to disinfecting the area. After few minutes everything was alright. Well, as much as it can be when your best and only friend shows up bleeding on, what was supposed to be, a peaceful Sunday morning. 'Is that the only one?''Yeah, no more cuts.' Sherlock said and stand up, holding his stomach.'Why are you holding your hand like that?''It's nothing serious, John.''Oh come on, Sherlock! You need to tell me if you were hurt. Come on, take off your shirt.' He said frustrated. 'Now!' He added after seeing hesitation from his friend.Suddenly the doorbell rang. Sherlock wanted to answer the door to leave the uncomfortable situation, but John stopped him. 'Not now, we are busy. However, it is will wait.'Sherlock sighed and unbuttoned his shirt. His stomach was bruised, but there were no cuts. John touched the stomach in multiple places. Everything seemed fine, but...'What are those?' Said John pointing kinesiology tapes covering his pectoral muscles.Before Sherlock could answer they heard someone unlocking the door.'I saw the footage and wanted to check on you... brother mine' Mycroft finished his sentence slowly trying to judge what is happening. You see... John sleeps only with boxers on...'I'm fine. We can talk in the living room.' Sherlock uttered and stormed out of the bathroom living John with his question unanswered.John sighed and started cleaning the bathroom. It took some time until he dressed up and was ready to join Holmes brothers.'Are you sure?' Mycroft sounded more worried than usual 'I don't want to mess with your choices, but... I want you to be safe.''Oh, fuck of. I've lived with him for three years. I know him.''Alright. I am going home, but John seems to be waiting behind the door. Come in!' John blushed and come in. Sherlock was sitting on the sofa with his shirt already buttoned up. 'Remember I am always there for you. Call me anytime brother mine.''I am sorry, I wasn't...' John started, but Mycroft already left.'It's okay John, sit down.' Sherlock said and smiled sadly. 'Mycroft insists on telling you something. Well, maybe also it was the situation we were a few minutes ago.''Is something wrong?' At this point, John was seriously worried.'No, nothing's wrong. I just have a... statement to make, a coming out one may say... I am transgender. John, do you know what this means?' Sherlock looked at John who opened his eyes wider.'What?''Transgender means that my masculinity is an effect of my own efforts, not the by-product of socialization. In other words - I am the one who created myself. From the basics as my name to the rest. Of course, it's all based on observation of others, but I like to say I made myself on my own.' Sherlock smiled mischievously.'Yeah, sorry. I know what transgender meant... but umm okay. I am a bit surprised.' John was struggling to speak. 'Of course, I don't have a problem with transsexuals...''Transgender, transgender people' Sherlock corrected him automatically. 'Please continue.''Thanks, I don't have a problem with transgender people, I just wasn't suspecting that. Umm so... what does it mean in terms of our relationship? How should I refer to you?' Sherlock saw John's struggle to be polite and laughed.'Sherlock. You should refer to me as Sherlock - that's my name. I also use he/him pronouns just I have before this conversation.''Yeah, right.' John nodded and suddenly his eyes opened wider, he looked at Sherlock's shirt and blushed.'Yes, the tape is covering my breasts, John.' Sherlock answered the unasked question 'If you have anything else to ask now is a good time.''Umm... Why... Umm... What was Mycroft doing here?' He blurted after a while'Oh, he saw me beaten up on his monitoring system and wanted to check if you took care of me. He is overprotective, but has good intentions.' Sherlock paused for a moment. 'Well, I need to check again where he has cameras. Anyway, do you have any other questions? Perhaps about me being transgender?''No, I don't... well can I really ask something?' Sherlock nodded 'Why do you have breasts?'Sherlock chuckled. 'My dear Watson... When you turn fourteen, sometimes even at ten or twelve your body starts to change... It can be confusing, but you as a doctor should know that.''Yeah sorry, this question was inappropriate.' Sherlock nodded and stand up to look out the window.'I'll go to my room. Call me if you need me.' John left the room and Sherlock picked up his violin.He played slow, but rather joyful music, so John concluded that he wasn't mad about the question. 'That's good' John thought. Maybe he should have known it wasn't his place to assume that Sherlock wants to have his breasts removed. He sighed. It was a bit too much for him. Of course, he was a doctor, but he went to military school, so no one there mentioned transgender people. He opened his computer and tried to google some information.***'Is he fine?' The voice from the bedroom asked'Yeah, and he came out to John.' Mycroft entered the room to see his partner sitting in bed.'Wow, that's big. And how has John reacted?' 'I wasn't there, but he texted me it was fine.''I'm sure he would call you if he had any problem.' He put his laptop away to make room 'I hope so, darling. I hope so.' Mycroft said sadly and lied on the bed putting his head on his partner's lap. Greg smiled and kissed Mycroft's forehead.'I'm sure he would.'

Enjoy John's identity crisises :)

'John? Are you there?' Only after the question, John realized that Sherlock has been knocking on the door for a few minutes.
'Huh? Yeah,' He yawned and stands up to open the door. 'Good morning' He said and walked back to bed.
'Do you want scrambled eggs?' Sherlock asked looking through his phone
'You wake me up to ask me that?'
'Yes. If I have waited until you get up, the eggs would have been cold.' Sherlock said as if this was a legitimate reason to wake someone.
'But... yeah, I want eggs.'
'Great, they are in the kitchen. I'm going to Molly, don't wait with the dinner.'
'What? You are not...' John didn't even have time to finish his question because Sherlock has already left. 'Okay. It looks like I'll eat alone.' He said to himself and help himself with the meal.
It must have been some sort of experiment because Sherlock prepared two dozens of eggs. To John's disappointment, there was no evidence of Sherlock actually eating any of it. Obviously, he was used to the eating habits of his friend, but he still was worried when he was noticing a lack of appetite for a longer period of time. John didn't know how to help his friend. The only thing he was sure of was the fact that any kind of therapist is of the limits with Holmes.
Some people (like Lestrade) have been telling John, that he shouldn't worry about it. It's not his job, and Sherlock is an adult. He knew that, but it didn't change anything.
John felt responsible for his flatmate, they lived together for a couple of years, they spend most of their free time together. Even when John was alone, he mostly thought about Sherlock. God, he even had a blog about his friend. Yeah, after some reflection it did seemed a bit odd. However, who isn't odd? John was used to the tightness of their relationship. Sherlock meant everything to him. But... he had to admit - there were some things he missed. For example the lack of physical intimacy. It's not like Sherlock told him not to date anyone. They haven't even talked about it. Well... maybe they did in the beginning, but that was a mistake. John even went on a couple of dates, but every time he felt like he would rather spend time with Sherlock. At one point he even started to question his sexuality. Maybe he is just gay? It sounded logical - a straight man should think about his male - friend during kissing a girl. He tried dating guys, but it didn't help either. He definitely was attracted to them, but still... they weren't Sherlock. So he stopped dating at all. But that... felt lonely. He spent a lot of time with Sherlock, he met his brother. They lived together... Everyone used to suspect they are dating... they didn't.
To be fair, it was something that John was thinking about often... Maybe he should date Sherlock? Maybe his other relationships were doomed to failure because he has been in love with Sherlock from the very beginning.
Somehow, he didn't feel it's a good idea. What if Sherlock doesn't want to be in that kind of relationship with him? John knew Sherlock is gay - they've talked about it once, when they were discussing a movie, they've watched together. Sherlock said the character's portrayal was stereotypical and unfair. John was surprised Sherlock cared about that, so the younger Holmes told him that he is in fact gay and he even tried activism when he was in college.
So if Sherlock was gay and a genius he definitely knew that John liked him... like that. And if that's the case John should accept this rejection.
However... there were days when John still was dreaming about them together. When days like that came he was rethinking everything again. Maybe he should try? After all Sherlock was always very nice to him, and he wasn't nice to anybody (at least no without any intentions).
'Oh, fuck it! I'll ask him today!' John screamed and blushed. Vocalizing his thought wasn't intentional.
'Who will you ask what?' Sherlock asked and John jumped in his seat. He hasn't realized he wasn't alone anymore.
'How long have you been here?!'
'About ten minutes' Sherlock said scanning John with his eyes. 'I thought it's not a problem I spend time in my apartment.'
'No, sorry. I just thought you said you would come back late.'
'My plans changed. I haven't realized Molly's boss has cameras. He saw me setting a corpse on fire and called security.'
'You did what?'
'Oh come on, John. Don't look surprised. I had everything under control.' He shook his head. 'What do you wanted to tell me?'
'How do you know it was...' John didn't finish his sentence as Sherlock raised his eyebrow. 'Yeah, nothing... I just wanted to ask you how are your injuries healing.'
'They are fine, John. But I know you are lying.' He looked on John in silence and sighted. 'Well, if you don't want to tell me I'm going to go rest in my room.' Sherlock walked out of the room.
'Stop! I wanted to ask if you want go with me to Mike's party.' John blurted the words before he could stop himself.
'Yeah, sure. When should we leave?'
'About nine o clock.'
'So we have eight hours... Okay.'
Sherlock left Watson in shock. He wasn't ready for this. Did he just ask Sherlock on a date? No, of course not, it's just a party. But what does Sherlock thinks. They really need to talk about... all of this.

Let's make things clear. John was nervous. Extremely nervous. He just asked Sherlock out on a date. How did he do that? Why? He hadn't planned it. It just... happened. Well, maybe that's how life works. Maybe it just happens. John wasn't satisfied with that explanation, he was pacing in front of his mirror checking how his hair looks. It was fine. Same as the shirt he decided to wear. Unfortunately, John wasn't comforted by these facts. Not when Sherlock wasn't there. To be fair it was only five past nine, so it was not a big deal at all. Also, it's not like there is a fixed time when everyone shows up. Even if they came an hour later than the rest nothing would happen. John knew all of that. Deep down he knew, that it isn't the party he is worried about. He was worried about what can happen afterward. He planned that he would tell Sherlock what he feels in the cab on the way back. That sounded logical. They will sit together for a set amount of time, so Sherlock would have to listen. And if it goes wrong he can just say he is sleepy and go to his room avoiding any awkward conversations.John knew the plan was good, he was just worried.'John?' Sherlock shouted through the door 'Sorry I'm late, I only need a minute and we can leave.' Sherlock left in the bathroom before John could answer. In a few minutes, they were sitting in a cab.'Who is Mike?' asked Sherlock'Who?' John was repeating what he wanted to say and wasn't paying attention.'Mike. The one who invited you to the party we are currently going to.' 'Oh, he is a friend from work. We don't talk much, but I guess he likes me. I help him a lot. He is two years older than me and has a wife - Vanessa. I don't know if she'll be there, she is also a doctor, but works in a different hospital.'Sherlock nodded. The rest of the ride they spent in silence.

'Hi! I am happy you came!' The tall man shouted to out-yell loud music. 'Who are you with?' He asked pointing at Sherlock.'It's my friend! Sherlock!' John answer. 'Here! That's for you!'Cool! Thanks' Mike said as he received the gift. 'Almost everyone's here!''I see!' John nodded and looked at the crowd. There were about thirty people in the room. He recognized about a third of them. People were dancing. It was a nice place, but the music was definitely too loud, John also didn't like the fact that people were smoking inside. He hated the smell. Secretly, he was also afraid of them. He was worried someone may get burned. It wasn't an irrational fear. It happens once to him when he was in college. He was at the party and a girl he was making out with setting his jacket on fire. Fortunately, he realized something it's wrong and took it off quickly, but the fear stayed. He shook his head and decided to get a drink from him and for Sherlock.Holding to glasses of beer, he tried to find his friend in the crowd. He found him looking uncomfortable, talking to a stranger in the quieter area. He approached them in the middle of the conversation.'Here's a beer for you.' He handed a drink to Sherlock. 'Hi! My name is John. I know Mike from work.' He smiled at the man.'I'm Steven. I studied with Mike.' The man responded and continued. 'I was telling your friend why gay couples shouldn't adopt children. You see. I'm a psychiatrist and I work with children. I'd know.''Ohh...' John was struck by this answer'Can you imagine, this guy disagrees with me?' John could imagine that.'Yeah, well I heard Mike was looking for you.' 'Really?''I've just talked to him. He was over there.' John pointed to the furthest corner of the local.'Thanks, man.' Steve said and wobbled through the room.'Are you ok?' John asked and touched Sherlock's arm'I'm fine, John. I didn't need a rescue. I would be fine.' John noticed a hint of annoyance in his voice, but overall Sherlock seemed relieved.'I'm sure you would. I just didn't want him to ruin our evening.' He smiled softly. 'Do you want to have some shots?''We just... sure, why not.' Sherlock agreed and they began their journey to the bar. It seemed that right now there were much more people than before, so already crowded room became very difficult to go through. They succeeded in their mission and happily drunk a couple of rounds. Later John has to go to the loo and when he came back Sherlock was nowhere to be found. After some time he finally found Sherlock. Surprisingly, once again he was talking with Steve. This time the man was even drunker. 'And that's just wrong!' He shouted. 'They want to have kids, but they put penises in their bottoms. But you know what's weird? I had a penis in my girlfriend's bottom. Can you imagine?!' He was speaking very loudly. Sherlock understandably uncomfortable was just standing there observing John's struggles to find his way through the crowd.'Hi John!' said Sherlock theatrically and make a step towards his friend. Then, before John could realize what's happening he kissed him on the lips. John, surprised, but happy, closed the space between there and embraced Sherlock in a tight hug. It could go longer, but suddenly they heard Steve vomiting, so they stepped back.'We should go back.' said John to Sherlock's ear, still holding him by his waist.'Yeah.' said Sherlock with satisfactionThey left the building, the streets were empty, there were few cars, but no cabs, so after some time they decided that they should start walking home.John gathered all of his courage and started. 'I wanted to talk to you about something.' 'I'm listening.''I wanted to ask you out, I... I'm not sure how you'd react, but... well I need to tell you this anyway. I was silent for too long. So...' John took a big breath and looked at Sherlock. The taller man was listening carefully. 'I think I am in love with you. Well, I'm sure I am. And I wanted to ask if you are too.'Sherlock smiled and pulled John closer to him. He looked him into the eyes, their faces were just as close as they can be without touching. 'Yes, I am.' He whispered and kissed him.John was struck. Was he waiting all those years feeling he should stop fantasizing about Sherlock just to learn he liked him back? The kiss ended and they continued to walk. This time holding hands.'I also wanted to say I'm sorry.''Oh?' This time Sherlock looked surprised'I mean when I asked you about your... chest. I shouldn't have. Sorry. I want you to know I respect you and I don't want to make you uncomfortable.' He wasn't looking into Sherlock's eyes. If he did, he would see Sherlock's smile.'It's okay, John. It just wasn't the best time. I wasn't prepared. And... it's not as easy as one may think. Especially cis dude like you. No offense.' He looked at John. 'I see you are trying to be the best you can, I appreciate that.'When they returned to their apartment Sherlock offered to make tea. John agreed, so here there were. In the kitchen, drinking tea, in the middle of the night. John noticed Sherlock's shaking a bit. He also felt cold, so he moved his chair so their legs can touch.Their cups were empty they still were sitting together. Talking about some childhood memories and stupid people. Before anyone realized Sherlock had his hand on John's tight. He wasn't doing anything, just gently stroking John's leg, slowly moving towards his groin, while keeping looking deep into John's eyes. 'Do you want to take off your pants?' Sherlock asked. John smiled and without any further hesitation pulled his jeans down and throw them on the floor. 'Let's go to the bedroom.' He offered. Without splitting apart they've managed to lay on the bed. 'Can I see you naked?' John asked but after seeing Sherlock's frown he added quickly 'Only if you want to, we don't...''Shush... It's fine. Just... remember I am a man.' Sherlock pulled down his pants as John unbuttoned his shirt, kissing his partner on the neck.'I love you.' John purred'I love you too' said Sherlock and went down on John's penis. John moaned as Sherlock licked the head of his erection. John kissed his partner and embraced him. Sherlock started to rub his tights on John's genitals. John reached Sherlock's crotch with his hand and started rubbing his clitoris. 'Is it all right?' He asked'Yeah, you can go inside.' Sherlock whispered and kissed his neck.'Lube?' John asked and, as Sherlock nodded, he reached to his nightstand for a bottle.

Ok, so I decided to flip perspectives, cause I got tired of John. (Sorry if you liked him.)


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Sherlock woke up sore. His head was pulsing; he felt nauseous and dizzy. Carefully he stands up and walked to the bathroom. After seeing his reflection in the mirror he decided to take a shower. He looked at his chest and shivered, but started to peel off his tapes. He turned on hot water. As the glue soaked it was easier but still painful. He washed his hair and naked walked out of the bathroom. He walked into his room and found some comfortable clothes. Tight, but a flexible tank top and a loose shirt. If he had to point one thing he hated more than stupid people he would say binders. They made his back hurt and his arms lose mobility, which was an awful prize for effects that could be achieved for less. He combed his wet hair and walked to the kitchen. He still felt sick, but a cup of tea made it a little bit better. When John woke up, Sherlock was writing responses for his clients. Some of their problems, 'mysteries' as they stupidly called them could be solved by text. Clients didn't appreciate the way Sherlock has been treating them, but who really cared. Sherlock wasn't doing it for money anyway.'Good morning, John.' He said without raising his eyes.'Hi' John answered with a big smile on his face. 'What are you up to?''Nothing, I've been just wondering...' Sherlock bit his lip. 'Do you remember yesterday?''Yeah, I do.' John smiled and blushed, but as Sherlock wasn't smiling he asked. 'Is something wrong?''No! It's great. I'm happy we did it, John.' Sherlock reassured his friend. 'But I wanted to talk about it. Yesterday we were drunk, but now... what are we going to do about it?''Well, what I've said wasn't fully spontaneous, so... if you want we can... continue?' He waited for Sherlock's reaction, but the other man remained silent. 'Sherlock? Are you sure everything's fine? Have I done something wrong?' 'No... You haven't done anything wrong, but... I feel we need to really talk about it. Like... how do you imagine dating me?' Sherlock avoided eye contact.'I mean... probably quite similar to how our friendship looks now, but with sex and kissing.' John's straightforward answer made Sherlock laugh.'I was asking about how do you imagine dating me since I am transgender, John.' He quickly returned to a serious tone.'Yeah... Well, I don't imagine it would cause any problems. I love you, Sherlock. I've loved you when I didn't know you're transgender and I love you now. But like... if you have something you want to clarify I am always ready for listening.'Sherlock stand up and kissed John softly.'Maybe later.' He wanted to hug, John, but the shorter man stepped back.Sherlock almost started to worry, but John kneeled down. 'Sherlock, will you be my boyfriend?' Sherlock laughed and kissed John's forehead. 'I will.'

Ok, so this is the last chapter of this story (for now, as I have an exam coming in few weeks). And... I hope you enjoyed it and you are not mad at me about where the end is. There are chances I publish a second part (if I do it'll be shown somewhere), but I'm quite happy how I closed my main point of the story.","['ch3rry9012', 'toujourspurr', 'Kaxlie', 'Julietneko', 'AlisonTramontin']",['Julietneko']

Slyszy ogien jeszcze zanim go zobaczy. Trzaski  i ryki wyglodnialej, nieludzkiej bestii. Odwraca sie i widzi, jak plomienie wija sie w rogu jego sypialni; jezyki plomieni siegaja miekkich zaslon, pozeraja tapete. Goraco kradnie mu oddech z pluc, przypala mu skore.



Podbiega do drzwi, chwyta klamke i przekreca ja, ale drzwi  sie nie ruszaja. Sa zablokowane. Jest uwieziony.



Teraz plonie jego lozko. Jego krzeslo. Jego pudelko z zabawkami i jego rysunki na scianie nad biurkiem. Dym wypelnia pokoj, krzyczy o pomoc, gdy zbliza sie plomien, a wokol niego zamyka sie ryk ognia.



 


Siada, gwaltownie lapiac powietrze i probujac uchwycic obrazy szybko rozpraszajace sie z powrotem w cieniu jego umyslu. Plynaca przez niego adrenalina sprawia, ze ma ochote wyskoczyc z lozka i biec, ale czuje sie tak, jakby przebiegl juz bardzo wiele kilometrow. Mruga w ciemnosci, szukajac czegos znajomego, czegos co rozproszy jego dezorientacje, ale nigdy w zyciu nie widzial tego mieszkania.

Siedzi na lozku, z poscieli wydobywa sie mdly zapach wody kolonskiej, ktorego nie rozpoznaje. Potrafi w ciemnosci dostrzec maly aneks kuchenny i ksztalt fotela. To raczej nie jest hotel, ale zbyt za ciasno tu na salon. Chyba ... kawalerka?

Wierci sie, i czuje na przylegajacej do jego ciala koszuli ogromna, mokra plame po srodku klatki piersiowej, ktora zaczela juz zasychac na brzegach. Gleboki, ciemny szkarlat, niemal czarny w slabym swietle ksiezyca wpadajacym przez zakurzone zaluzje. Slyszy w uszach pulsujaca krew, gdy przyglada sie temu i przeszywa go dreszcz. Ostroznie odsuwa material z klatki piersiowej i brzucha, delikatnie przesuwajac palcami, kataloguje uwaznie swoje cialo, szukajac zrodla krwi. Jest jej tak wiele... jakby sie w niej kapal. Jest niejasno swiadomy, ze logicznie rzecz biorac powinien panikowac, ale jego umysl  jakby tonie we mgle.

Przesuwa sie powoli, czekajac, az pociagniecie rany spowoduje uderzenie pioruna przeszywajacego bolu; ale jedyne co go boli, to jego pulsujaca glowa i nie wydaje sie, aby to z niej krwawil.

Dracymi rekami klepie sie po kieszeniach, wyczuwajac z ulga ksztalt telefonu. Wyciagajac go, dzwoni do jedynej osoby, ktora chcialo mu sie zaprogramowac w kontaktach.

- Sherlock? - glos Johna jest ochryply od snu.

Sherlock odsuwa telefon i mruzy oczy; na ekranie jest 04:22.

- John  - zaczyna, ale oddech dlawi go w gardle. Teraz caly sie trzesie, dreszcz  przebiega przez jego cialo, saczy sie az do kosci. Jest mu tak strasznie zimno.

John natychmiast staje sie bardziej czujny. - Co sie stalo?

Jezyk Sherlocka jest sucha, niezdarna rzecza w jego ustach. - Ja... nie wiem...

Na drugim koncu linii jest ruch; slychac zamykajace sie drzwi.  Sherlock moze sobie wyobrazic Johna stojacego na podescie przed swoja sypialnia, aby nie zbudzic Rosie.

- Gdzie jestes? - pyta John. Teraz brzmi czujnie, a nawet naglaco.

- Sadze, ze jestem chyba ... w czyims mieszkaniu - odpowiada Sherlock, marszczac brwi wobec wlasnych niespojnych mysli.

Wstaje na slabe, trzesace sie nogi i podchodzi do malego biurka w rogu. Poczta jest rozrzucona na calej powierzchni blatu zrobionego z wyszczerbionej plyty wiorowej.

- W czyim mieszkaniu? - pyta John.

Jego szorstki, zatroskany glos wydaje sie byc tym, co wyprowadza Sherlocka z oparow jego zamglonego umyslu.

- W mieszkaniu Darrena Mathera - odpowiada mechanicznie Sherlock, odczytujac nazwisko z kopert. - W... Islington?

- Kim jest Darren Mather?

Sherlock jest pewien, ze nigdy wczesniej nie slyszal tego nazwiska. - Nie wiem.

- Sherlock, przerazasz mnie. Jestes tam sam?

Znowu sie rozglada, chociaz mala przestrzen nie mogla ukryc innej osoby.

- Tak, jestem sam. Wlasnie sie tu obudzilem -  bierze gleboki oddech. Czuje sie taki zdezorientowany, taki nierealny - Jest tu... sporo krwi. I ja ... ja jestem niemal caly w niej.

- Chryste, co sie stalo? Jestes ranny? Podaj mi adres, zadzwonie pod 999 ...!

- Nie, John ... ja... -  urywa, myslac z wysilkiem, lecz w umysl zaczyna wkradac sie panika. - Nie sadze, zeby to byla moja krew.

Cisza wisi miedzy nimi, zanim John glosno przelknie. - Podaj mi adres; juz jade.

 

          ***

 

Budynek jest ciemny i obskurny, w powietrzu unosi sie ciezki zapach plesni. Przypomina Johnowi budynek, w ktorym wynajmowal kawalerke w czasach przed Sherlockiem: stara farba odpadajaca ze scian, migoczace zielonkawe lampy w korytarzach, mrukliwi lokatorzy.

Johnowi zoladek sciska sie, gdy widzi, ze drzwi do mieszkania numer cztery sa uchylone. Wiele moglo sie wydarzyc w ciagu tych trzydziestu minut, jakie zajelo mu dotarcie na Islington z Baker Street. Czy Sherlock musial uciekac? A moze lokator wrocil?

Wyciaga reke, aby chwycic pistolet wetkniety za pasek dzinsow, poprawia mala torbe przewieszona przez ramie i powoli otwiera drzwi.

Przed switem pokoj oswietla przytlumione, szare swiatlo. To niewielka przestrzen: maly stolik z jednym krzeslem przy scianie w poblizu skromnie umeblowanej kuchni. Na niektorych haczykach na scianie wisza przypadkowe elementy garderoby, a do sciany przylega male, niechlujne pojedyncze lozko. Pusto.

- Sherlock?! -  John wola ostroznie, zanim zarejestruje jednostajny szum dochodzacy zza jedynych w tym pomieszczeniu drzwi. Prysznic jest w uzyciu.

Chowa bron, puka i wolno otwiera drzwi.

- Sherlock?

Potwierdzajacy pomruk, prawie zagluszony przez bulgoczaca wode.

- Moge wejsc?

Znowu pomruk, ktory niejasno przypomina potwierdzenie.

Ubrania Sherlocka leza w stosie na podlodze, co jest tak niepodobne do niego, ze John patrzy przez chwile ponad nimi, az szkarlatne plamy przyciagaja jego uwage. Choc ubranie jest pogniecione, John moze dostrzec duze, niemal zaschniete, ciemnoczerwone plamy, ktore wsiakly w jego koszule. Podnosi ja i rejestruje iz opadla mu szczeka z powodu ilosci krwi, ktora dojrzal.

- Jezu, Sherlock... czy ty... jestes pewien, ze nie jestes ranny?

- N-n-nie - odpowiada Sherlock, szczekajac zebami. Jego glos jest niski i dobiega gdzies z dolu. John odsuwa nieco zaslone i widzi przez pare wodna, dlugie palce u nog i kolana oraz mocno owiniete wokol nich ramiona Sherlocka. Siedzi on na dnie brodzika, skulony tak mocno, jak tylko moze. Goraca woda lecaca z prysznica parzy jego skore do czerwonosci i napelnia pomieszczenie para, ale Sherlock drzy gwaltownie, jakby przenikaly go ogromne dreszcze.

- Jest mi tak ... z-zimno - udaje mu sie powiedziec gdy patrzy na Johna spod ociekajacych woda ciemnych lokow.

- Drzenie neurogenne  - mamrocze John do siebie. Wypaczona ewolucyjnie wersja walki lub ucieczki. Powodz hormonow stresu, wywolujaca drzenie miesni glebokich. Siega do srodka i zakreca prysznic. Glowa Sherlocka opada na trzesace sie kolana, ktore uderzaja o siebie pod dygoczacymi ramionami.

John chwyta dwa reczniki z polki pod zlewem i kladzie jeden na ramionach Sherlocka, a drugi na krawedzi brodzika. - Wytrzyj sie, przynioslem ci czyste ubranie. Gdy sie uspokoisz, zrobi sie tobie cieplej.

Sherlock marszczy brwi.

 -Jestem spo-kojny - protestuje, ale jego przekonanie ginie w drzeniu jego glosu.

Przeczesujac dlonia wlosy, John bierze gleboki oddech i wycofuje sie z powrotem do pokoju.

Wszystko wyglada pozornie normalnie i widac, ze w mieszkaniu ktos na co dzien rezyduje; jest balagan, stosy poczty, kilka rozrzuconych ubran, naczynia w zlewie i niezaslane lozko. Nie jest to miejsce, ktorym mozna by sie chwalic. John jest nagle bardzo wdzieczny za ich domostwo przy Baker Street.

Drzwi do lazienki otwieraja sie ze skrzypieniem i pojawia sie Sherlock, z recznikiem zawiazanym wokol talii i drugim owinietym wokol ramion; widac, ze wciaz ma dreszcze.

- Siadaj - poleca John, podprowadzajac go w nogi lozka. Z bliska widzi plamy na poduszce i przescieradle, nie od razu zauwazalne na tle ciemnego koloru. Unosi podbrodek Sherlocka, zeby spojrzec mu w oczy. Obie zrenice wydaja sie byc tej samej wielkosci i normalnie reaguja na swiatlo. John zaluje, ze nie mial tyle rozsadku, by zabrac ze soba cala torbe medyczna.  - Wodz wzrokiem za moim palcem - mowi cicho John, a Sherlock robi to bez narzekania. Doktor kladzie palce na szyi Sherlocka mierzac mu puls, ktory jest nieco podwyzszony, ale nie niepokojaco. Kilka analogicznych nastepujacych po stresie uwarunkowan. Cisnienie krwi tez jest w normie, sadzac po tym, jak latwo bylo odnalezc tetno dystalne.* 

- Masz mdlosci? Jestes oszolomiony? - docieka dalej.

- Nie - odpowiada cicho Sherlock - Chociaz ocknalem sie w tym lozku z okropnym bolem glowy.

- A ten co tu mieszka? Darren Mather? Jestes pewien, ze go tu nie bylo?

- Kiedy sie obudzilem, bylem sam ... ale... nie pamietam niczego wczesniej.

- Jaka jest ostatnia rzecz, ktora pamietasz?

- Zjedlismy curry na obiad - mowi Sherlock, ze zmarszczonymi brwiami i nieobecnym spojrzeniem.

- To bylo dwa dni temu - odpowiada John. - Powiedziales mi, ze zamierzasz odwiedzic rodzicow i pojedziesz wieczornym pociagiem. Przypuszczam, ze do nich nie dotarles.

Sherlock wymamrotal cos potakujaco, lecz z lekkim roztargnieniem.

- Wlasciwe pytanie - buczy z sarkazmem John - brzmi: czy w ogole  kiedykolwiek zamierzales tam dotrzec.

Sherlock wzrusza ramionami i kreci glowa, po czym wydaje z siebie sfrustrowany pomruk i chwyta sie za skronie.

Jego frustracja, jego tak bardzo nietypowa, zatrwazajaca nieswiadomosc wydaje sie autentyczna Johnowi, ktory pochyla sie, szukajac kontaktu wzrokowego. - Razi cie swiatlo?

- Nie.  Ja po prostu... nic nie pamietam. To irytujace.

Uraz glowy latwo by to wszystko wyjasnil, wiec John podnosi glowe Sherlocka do gory i przeczesuje palcami jego wilgotne loki, sprawdzajac, czy nie ma guzow lub skaleczen, ale nic nie znajduje. Cofa sie, nastepne pytanie utyka mu w gardle. - Czy... brales cos?

-Nie.

- Przeciez mowiles, ze nic pamietasz.

- Wiec po co mnie o to pytasz? -  warczy Sherlock. Wypuszcza sfrustrowany oddech. - Gdybym nawet  to zrobil ... gdybym cos wzial - szydzi - nie ma na to zadnych dowodow.

 Prycha niecierpliwie, kiedy widzi, jak oczy Johna przesuwaja sie do zgiecia jego ramienia. - Mozesz sobie sprawdzic, jesli mi nie wierzysz.

- Sherlock, wiesz rownie dobrze jak ja, ze halucynogeny nie sa zazwyczaj wstrzykiwane. Mozna je rowniez podawac w sposob, ktorego moglbys nie zauwazyc.

Sherlock szturcha go w ramie palcem wskazujacym. - Jestes realny, a wiec najwyrazniej nie mam halucynacji na temat ciebie tutaj, ani nie doswiadczam zadnych objawow wskazujacych na oslabienie po dawce stymulantow badz opiatow.

John unosi rece w gescie poddania sie.  - I jestes pewien, ze nie masz zadnych zranien ani siniakow? - pyta, chociaz Sherlock jest teraz owiniety recznikami  tylko w pasie, wiec John widzi to na wlasne oczy.

- Zadnych.

- Nie boli cie brzuch?

- Odrobine sie zdenerwowalem - mruczy niechetnie Sherlock.

- W porzadku - mowi John, trac czolo. Podnosi torbe, ktora przyniosl z miejsca przy drzwiach, rozpina ja i kladzie stos ubran na lozku obok Sherlocka. - Ubieraj sie. Zalatwie nam taksowke - Wyciaga komorke i otwiera aplikacje z mapami. - Mysle, ze Whittington jest niedaleko stad.

Glowa Sherlocka podskakuje do gory. - Whittington? Jak szpital w Whittington?

John zmierza go swoim najlepszym spojrzeniem typu ,,nawet nie probuj"".  - Tak. Oczywiscie, musimy ...

- Nie jade do zadnego szpitala! - wykrzykuje Sherlock, odskakujac, by wstac i majac nadzieje, ze John nie zauwazy, kiedy chwieje sie przez chwile.

- Sherlock, posluchaj mnie - blaga John. - Musi cie obejrzec neurolog. To jest powazne: nie pamietasz znacznej czesci czasu, masz silny bol glowy, twoje dzialania i mysli sa spowolnione ...

Sherlockowi opada szczeka. - Moje mysli z pewnoscia NIE sa spowolnione!

Brwi Johna unosza sie  - Serio? To powiedz mi: jak zarabia na zycie Darren Mather?

Oczy Sherlocka biegaja po pokoju, probujac uchwycic wskazowki, znalezc powiazania, ale John widzi, ze konczy sie to niepowodzeniem. W pokoju panuje balagan, wokol rozsianych jest wystarczajaco duzo dowodow, tak ze Sherlock zwykle juz zorientowalby sie w historii zycia tego mezczyzny.

John kreci glowa. - Nie udalo ci sie wydedukowac ani jednej rzeczy o tej sytuacji, o tej kawalerce, o jej mieszkancu, ani o tym skad tyle krwi na twoim ubraniu. A moze wlasnie zapomniales wspomniec o swoich odkryciach? To raczej nie lezy w twojej naturze, moglbym dodac. Geniusz potrzebuje publicznosci i tak dalej.

Sherlock patrzy gniewnie, ale jego milczenie mowi wiele. Nie moze ukryc swojego oszolomienia przed kims, kto zna go tak dobrze, jak John.

- To moze byc oznaka problemu z doplywem krwi do mozgu lub wirusa ... moze zapalenia mozgu. Mozliwy jest rowniez atak epileptyczny. Nawet jesli to TGA**  to diagnoza ustalana jest przez wykluczenie wielu innych rzeczy  - jednak zdecydowanie odpedza mysl o guzach mozgu i tetniakach. - A co, jesli wykaszlales cala te krew? Moglo to byc krwawienie z przewodu pokarmowego - zwraca uwage.

Jednak John watpi, ze tak jest, poniewaz zauwazylby znajomy, obrzydliwie mdlacy zapach wymiocin zmieszanych z zakrzepla krwia, ale Sherlock w jego obecnym stanie wydaje sie zbyt oszolomiony by kontrargumentowac. Zwykle jest bardzo bystry, jesli chodzi o sprawy medyczne, wiec jego brak dyskusji jest alarmujaco godny uwagi.

 - Niezaleznie od tego, musisz byc zbadany w szpitalu. Jedziemy taksowka albo wzywam karetke. Twoj wybor.

Sherlock zaciska szczeke, zrzuca recznik i siega po stos ubran. Koszula i spodnie sa lekko wygniecione, ale na szczescie gatki sa czyste.

- Zlapalem pierwsze twoje ciuchy, ktore znalazlem na szczycie wypranego stosu w lazience - mowi przepraszajaco John, obserwujac Sherlocka ostroznym okiem lekarza. - Nie chcialem tracic czasu na dotarcie do ciebie, a musialem jeszcze sprawdzic, co z Rosie i zaniesc elektroniczna nianie do pani Hudson ... - urywa, przekonany, ze jego pacjent jednak nie upadnie, i odwraca sie z powrotem, by dac Sherlockowi odrobine prywatnosci.

Sherlock podnosi torbe, a John podejrzewa, ze ma nadzieje znalezc tam przybory toaletowe. Bez pewnego produktu jego wlosy sa szybko schnaca, kedzierzawa katastrofa, ale w torbie nie ma juz nic wiecej, poniewaz John o tym nie pomyslal, no i w sumie nie to bylo priorytetem.

- Moj plaszcz? - pyta Sherlock, rozgladajac sie po pokoju.

John kreci glowa. - Nie bylo go w twoim pokoju ani na wieszaku przy drzwiach. Mysle, ze bym go nie przeoczyl. Jestem pewien, ze miales go przy sobie, kiedy wyjezdzales.

W torbie pozostaly juz tylko buty. John odwraca sie, kiedy slyszy, jak uderzaja o podloge i bez slowa wskazuje Sherlockowi, ze powinien znowu usiasc.

- Nic mi nie jest - protestuje Sherlock, ale John tylko zaciska usta i patrzy na niego przez chwile, zanim ustapi. Doktor kleka i wsuwa buty na stopy Sherlocka, zawiazujac sznurowki szybko i mocno. Wstaje i wyciaga reke.

Sherlock patrzy na to i wzdycha znaczaco, po czym staje sam. - John, przysiegam ci, nic mi nie jest. Jesli popelniono przestepstwo, a ja tam bylem, to musze wiedziec, co sie stalo. I musimy to zrobic teraz, zanim Met zlapie wiatr w zagle i zanieczysci moje miejsce zbrodni.

- Obiecuje ci, ze poznasz wszystkie szczegoly. Ale najpierw musimy sie upewnic, ze z toba wszystko w porzadku. Problemy neurologiczne moga szybko postepowac. Tetniaki potrafia sie pojawic w mgnieniu oka. Nie mamy czasu do stracenia. Jesli nadal chcesz sie o to klocic, to mozesz to robic na tylnym siedzeniu taksowki.

John wyczekujaco przytrzymuje skrzydlo drzwi dla Sherlocka.

- Moje ubrania? - pyta Sherlock, spogladajac w strone lazienki.

John oblizuje usta i przez chwile spoglada w dol. - Sa przeciez dowodami. Powinnismy je zostawic. Kiedy dotrzemy do szpitala, zadzwonimy do Lestrada i poinformujemy go, co sie stalo.

- Ale my wiemy, co sie stalo.

- Nie  - zgadza sie John - ale to nie wyglada dobrze. I chce miec pewnosc, ze cokolwiek wydarzy sie pozniej, bedziemy miec kogos po naszej stronie od poczatku tej sprawy.

- Ja nikogo nie ...

- Jasne, ze nie - mowi szybko i szczerze John, ale jego wyraz twarzy jest ponury. - Ale to nie mnie byc moze bedziesz musial przekonywac.

Spojrzenie, ktore rzuca mu Sherlock, mowi Johnowi, iz wie, ze doktor ma racje.

Jest jeszcze pewna rzecz. Jeszcze tylko jedna rzecz, ktora nalezy omowic, ale to jest ta najtrudniejsza. John przelyka sline, wyciaga reke, by powstrzymac Sherlocka przed wyjsciem. Zoladek lekko mu sie skreca na mysl o tym, co musi powiedziec.  - Kiedy dotrzemy do Whittington, mysle, ze powinienes rowniez rozwazyc badanie na okolicznosc zgwalcenia.

Oczy Sherlocka blyskaja zaskoczeniem, a potem zaprzecza. - Nie.

John powoli wypuszcza powietrze, aby dac sobie czas na znalezienie wlasciwych argumentow. Musi odwolac sie do logiki. - Budzisz sie w obcym lozku, w obcym mieszkaniu, nie majac pojecia, co sie wydarzylo. Nie masz zadnych widocznych obrazen, wiec ktos mogl cie odurzyc. Jaki jest najczestszy cel, dla ktorego ludzie robia takie rzeczy innym?

Taka mozliwosc przyszla Johnowi na mysl, odkad uslyszal odglos lecacej z prysznica wody. Widok Sherlocka trzesacego sie pod goracym prysznicem sprawil, ze podejrzewal tez wstrzas hipowolemiczny***  jako jedna z mozliwosci, ale woda splywala do odplywu juz czysta. Mimo to mysl, ze ktos moglby skrzywdzic Sherlocka w ten sposob, przyprawiala go o mdlosci. Mogla wywiazac sie walka. Napastnik zblizajacy sie do Sherlocka, krwawil z ust lub nosa i to moglo byc przyczyna czesci krwawych plam na jego koszuli.

- Myslisz, ze nie zauwazylbym ... ze poczulbym tego teraz, gdyby cos takiego mialo ...  - mowi zdenerwowany Sherlock. - Nic takiego sie nie wydarzylo. Wiedzialbym, gdyby tak sie stalo.

- Dobra - John potakuje. - Przepraszam. Po prostu ... nie chce ryzykowac, jasne?

- Potrzebuje portfela - mowi Sherlock  raptownie zmieniajac temat, obracajac sie na piecie i wbiegajac z powrotem do lazienki. John slyszy szelest, gdy Sherlock grzebie w kieszeniach spodni, a potem wszystko nagle cichnie.

- Sherlock? - glos Johna jest napiety, walczy ze znajomym rozblyskiem asekuracyjnego gniewu. Sherlock wychodzi z lazienki i w milczacej odpowiedzi wyciaga w rece pek kluczy. Stojac przy drzwiach, John widzi kilka metalowych kluczy do domu i stary, porysowany kluczyk samochodowy. Wszystkie sa pokryte krwia, a na breloku z Union Jackiem pojawila sie duza czerwona plama. Unosi brwi, gdy detektyw podchodzi do jedynego malego okienka w kawalerce, naciska przycisk zamka na kluczyku i patrzy, jak w odpowiedzi na to swiatlami miga stary srebrny datsun na ulicy ponizej.

- Sherlock? - tym razem ciszej, ale bardziej niecierpliwie. - Musimy isc.

Im szybciej dotra do szpitala i wykonaja badania laboratoryjne oraz dokladne badania neurologiczne, tym szybciej znajda odpowiedzi.

- Coz, John, mamy szczescie. Wyglada na to, ze nasza podwozka juz tu jest.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Samochod jest w takim samym stanie jak kawalerka; maly, niechlujny, bardzo sfatygowany, lecz wydaje sie byc sprawny. Sherlock otwiera drzwi pasazera i nie marnuje czasu przegladajac schowek, znajduje dowod rejestracyjny.

- To Darrena Mathera? - pyta John obok niego, a Sherlock pomrukuje potwierdzajaco.

Sprawdza reszte smieci walajacych sie po samochodzie: przewody do odpalania akumulatora, kilka opakowan po jedzeniu na wynos  i pusty kubek po kawie. W drugim uchwycie na kubek jest wizytowka: ,,Marissa Delamere - specjalistka psychoterapii holistycznej i odzyskiwania pamieci.""

John podchodzi do drzwi kierowcy i pochyla sie, zeby zajrzec do srodka. - Na kierownicy jest krew - oznajmia ponuro, odwracajac sie, by spojrzec na Sherlocka, ale cos innego przykuwa jego uwage i jego twarz jeszcze bardziej sie nachmurza.  -  A na tylnym siedzeniu lezy cos, co wyglada dokladnie jak twoja torba podrozna.

Sherlock odwraca sie, zeby spojrzec. John ma racje. Wysiada z samochodu, otwiera tylne drzwi i wyjmuje torbe.

- Chryste, Sherlock - wydycha John, przeczesujac dlonia wlosy. Kreci glowa z niedowierzaniem, patrzac na detektywa znad samochodu. - Musimy zadzwonic do Lestrade. Bierzmy taksowke i jedzmy do szpitala. Zadzwonimy do niego po drodze .

Blysk zolci przyciaga wzrok Sherlocka, wiec siega na podloge, by wyciagnac maly, naddarty kawalek zoltego papieru w linie. Adres zapisany odrecznie. Sherlock unosi kartke, marszczac brwi.

John staje obok niego. - Co to jest?

- Adres w Milbury.

- To twoje pismo.

Sherlock wpisuje adres do swojej komorki i mruczy pod nosem - To nie daleko. Mozemy tam byc w mniej niz dwadziescia minut.

Oczy Johna rozszerzaja sie. - O, nie. Absolutnie nie! Jedziemy ...

- Do szpitala; tak, tak. - przerywa mu detektyw - Ale w rzeczywistosci szpital Royal Claringdon znajduje sie tuz obok  i ma lepsza renome, niz ten w Whittington, a jesli pamiec mnie nie myli, wspomniales kiedys, ze znasz kilku tamtejszych lekarzy, co sprawia, ze staje sie on wygodniejsza opcja. Rzut oka, aby sprawdzic dokad prowadza tropy, a nastepnie prosto na izbe przyjec  -  zaczyna isc w strone glownej drogi, by znalezc taksowke, a John biegnie za nim.

Zatrzymuja sie na rogu, Sherlock obserwuje cicha ulice jak jastrzab. John jest niemal siny ze zlosci: ma zacisnieta szczeka, rozdete nozdrza. Potrzasa glowa.  - Nie pojmuje, dlaczego nie traktujesz tego powaznie. Zawsze upierasz sie, ze twoj umysl jest dla ciebie najwazniejszy, a reszta to tylko ,,transport""; ale teraz to wlasnie twoj umysl jest w niebezpieczenstwie, a ty wydajesz  sie tym zupelnie nie przejmowac.

Sherlock obraca sie, by na niego spojrzec.  - Oczywiscie, ze sie przejmuje! Doprowadza mnie to do szalu! Brakuje mi wspomnien z dwoch dni! Ale badzmy szczerzy, John. Ty i ja wiemy, ze to, co odkrylismy do tej pory przedstawia bardzo niefortunny obraz tego, co robilem w tym czasie, ktorego nie pamietam. Zasluguje przynajmniej na szanse, aby sprobowac dowiedziec sie jak najwiecej dla samego siebie, zanim mnie skuja.

- Sherlock, to nie to samo, co wparowanie do szpitala z rana postrzalowa - nie beda mieli powodu, aby wzywac policje, jesli przedstawimy im tylko twoje objawy.

- I zaryzykowac ze slad ostygnie? Ludzie zawsze maja... ludzi, a oni dowiedza sie, co sie stalo z ... z... - trudem probuje przypomniec sobie imie.

- Darrenem Matherem - podpowiada zaniepokojony John.  - Sam widzisz, o co mi chodzi. Nie funkcjonujesz normalnie.

Sherlock z oburzeniem odwraca sie i przywoluje taksowke, ktora wlasnie wylonila sie zza zakretu.

John wypuszcza sfrustrowany oddech przez nos, gdy podjezdza czarna taksowka. - Dobra - ustepuje. - Ale najwyzej piec minut. Potem prosto do szpitala. Zgoda?

Sherlock robi niewinna mine i otwiera drzwi samochodu dla Johna - Slowo skauta - mowi.

 

***

 

467 Hawksmoor Road w Milbury wyglada jakby byla nie na swoim miejscu. Zrujnowana, przewaznie opustoszala ulica w bogatej dzielnicy, niektore biznesiki wciaz tu dzialaja, ale to branze niszowe, istniejace tu juz oczywiscie szmat czasu; warsztat samochodowy, zakurzona wypozyczalnia instrumentow muzycznych i sklep z ubezpieczeniami. Sa tam takze pozostalosci zburzonych budynkow, fragmenty fundamentow,  stosy gruzu i smieci. Wyglada na to, ze gentryfikacja wisi nad tym miejscem jak deszczowa chmura, czekajaca tylko na okazje, aby ulewa oczyscic teren.

Drzwi z numerem 467 to srodkowy z trzech budynkow i niewiele wiecej niz drzwi miedzy dwoma witrynami sklepowymi. Numer 465 wyglada na dawno opuszczony: okna zamalowane, wyblakle informacje o wynajmie przyklejone tasma do drzwi; natomiast 469 to sklep z artykulami uzywanymi, bez polotu nazwany ,,Druga Szansa"". Zaden sklep na ulicy nie jest jeszcze otwarty, slonce wciaz jest stosunkowo nisko na porannym horyzoncie.  Patrzac na strukture budynku, oczywiste jest, ze to, co znajduje sie za drzwiami z numerem 467, to nic innego jak schody prowadzace do wynajmowanego lokalu na pietrze.

- Prosze zaczekac, wracamy za piec minut - mowi  John taksowkarzowi, ktory kiwa glowa ale i przypomina, ze licznik nadal bije.

Zgadzaja sie najpierw rozdzielic i obejrzec zewnetrzna strone budynku, ale gdy tylko John znika za rogiem

wyznaczonego mu boku, Sherlock podbiega z powrotem do taksowki.

- Wyglada na to, ze potrwa to troche dluzej, niz myslelismy - mowi kierowcy, podajac banknot za przejazd przez spuszczona szybe. - Zadzwonimy po inna taksowke, jak juz bedziemy gotowi wracac.

- Jestes pan pewien? - pyta taksowkarz, spogladajac z powatpiewaniem w kierunku, w ktorym poszedl John.

- Tak, zdecydowanie. To troche potrwa.

Taksowkarz wzrusza ramionami i odjezdza. Chwile pozniej John wraca ze swej ,,wyprawy"" dookola budynku i zaczyna biec, gdy widzi oddalajace sie tylne swiatla taksowki.

- Ej!

Sherlock robi krok do przodu, by spotkac podbiegajacego Johna.

- Prosilem, zeby zaczekal!

- A ja mu powiedzialem, ze nie musi. Zadzwonimy po inna, gdy skonczymy.

- Niech cie cholera Sherlock!

- To miejsce wydaje mi sie znajome, John. To tak, jakby wspomnienie bylo gdzies z tylu mojej glowy, jestem juz blisko, by je zlapac. Musimy wejsc do srodka.

- Ta sytuacja jest juz wystarczajaco zla bez aresztowania nas za wlamanie. Jesli to, co tam ewentualnie znajdziemy, ma zwiazek z... z tym, co ci sie przydarzylo w ciagu ostatnich dwoch dni...

Nagle, bez ostrzezenia, ogromny bol przeszywa glowe Sherlocka jak blyskawica. Nie moze powstrzymac sie od krzyku, chwytajac sie za skronie w daremnej probie powstrzymania udreki.

Czuje rece Johna na swoich ramionach, slyszy jego spanikowany glos wolajacy go po imieniu, ale rzeczywistosc znika, a otoczenie sie oddala.

 

 


Znowu krzyczy i lzy splywaja mu teraz po twarzy. Plomienie sie zblizaja, pomieszczenie pochlania pieklo. Na chwile zostaje oszolomiony, gdy stoi przy drzwiach i patrzy, jak posciel na jego lozku zapala sie. Raz jeszcze ciagnie i przekreca klamke. - MYCROFT! - krzyczy.



Eurus stoi przed nim, beznamietne oczy wbijaja w niego spojrzenie spomiedzy podskakujacych warkoczykow. - To  ze mna masz sie bawic - mowi, ale to jest tak, jakby ogien przemawial do niego, a nie mala dziewczynka; jej slowa hucza i trzaskaja. - A on niech sobie idzie do domu! - Victor odwzajemnia jej spojrzenie ze zloscia, po czym oddala sie w kierunku plazy ze swoim mieczem w rece. Placze.



Nagle plomienie znikaja, i jego ulubiona pluszowa zabawka jest na lozku, ale cos jest nie tak, poniewaz wspomnienie nie moze pochodzic z tego samego dnia. Zweglone, rozmoczone szczatki czegos, co kiedys bylo trzmielem, miekkie zolto-czarne futerko, podarowane mu przez babcie, gdy sie urodzil. To grozba.



Widzi, jak Mycroft stoi przed ich rodzicami; skads wzial sie na dole schodow.



Matka trzyma glowe w dloniach, ojciec jest odwrocony plecami, wpatrujac sie w huczacy ogniem kominek.



- Ona wami manipuluje! - krzyczy Mycroft i zamiast swojego doroslego brata, Sherlock widzi Mycrofta -jedenastolatka. Przyjechal ze szkoly, gdy Victor zaginal. 



Tatus jest wsciekly: - Przyjada po niego wieczorem i koniec! Tak bedzie najbezpieczniej dla nas wszystkich!  



Wydaje sie, jakby Sherlock nie rozumial tych slow. Mycroft odwraca sie lekko i widzi Sherlocka na schodach. Spotykaja sie  wzrokiem na chwile, zanim Sherlock ucieka z powrotem do swojej sypialni.



Zatrzaskuje za soba drzwi. Ale jest przerazony, widzac, ze wrocil w sam srodek  burzy ognia. Drzwi za nim znow sa zamkniete. Plomienie odcinaja mu droge. Jego gardlo plonie od goracego powietrza. Nie jest juz w stanie krzyczec. Nie moze juz oddychac. Nie moze...


 


 


- Sherlock? Sherlock, slyszysz mnie? - dlon na jego twarzy, kciuk glaszczacy go po kosci policzkowej. - Otworz oczy. Dalej Sherlock, otworz oczy. - glos Johna jest rozkazujacy, ale zdesperowany. Czuje zapach szamponu doktora, gdy ten pochyla sie blisko, nasluchujac jego oddechu.

Sherlock w koncu zbiera cala swoja energie, by byc poslusznym. - Dzieki Bogu - dyszy John, gdy Sherlock w koncu otwiera oczy, krzywiac sie na jasnoniebieskie niebo. Lezy plasko na plecach, trawa laskocze go w dlonie, a serce mu wali.

- Wiesz gdzie jestes? - dopytuje sie John, przygladajac mu sie, pochylil sie blizej, aby zbadac odruchy zrenic. - Sherlock? Slyszysz mnie?

Sherlock przelyka sline, probujac otrzasnac sie z dezorientacji, ktora przyszpila jego zdolnosc do jasnego myslenia. - Co sie stalo?

- Zlapales sie za glowe i krzyczales, a potem straciles przytomnosc - mowi John, palcami maca puls na Sherlockowym nadgarstku. - Ledwo cie zlapalem, zebys nie rozbil sobie o cos glowy. Jezu - oddycha ciezko, jakby biegl.

-  Pamietasz, gdzie jestesmy?

- Pojechalismy pod adres z tej notatki, ktora znalazlem w samochodzie Darrena Mathera - odpowiada Sherlock bez wahania, po czym probuje usiasc, ale natychmiast czuje nacisk silnych dloni na ramionach.

 - Mowy nie ma. Lez spokojnie - instruuje John. - Jaka jest ostatnia rzecz, ktora pamietasz?

Sherlock sie poddaje i pozwala Johnowi pomoc mu ulozyc sie na plecach; kreci mu sie w glowie, wiec pomysl wstawania nie wydaje sie zachecajacy.

 - Odjezdzajaca taksowka.

Na twarzy Johna pojawia sie cien. - Tak, cholernie dobra robota. Gdybym nie zgodzil sie na te bzdury, bylibysmy na ostrym dyzurze, kiedy to sie stalo. Jak sie czujesz?

Sherlock probuje sie skoncentrowac, ale macki wspomnien nie odpuszczaja i groza, ze go wciagna. Sa przerazajace, i on potrzebuje Johna, by zatrzymal go w rzeczywistosci. Stara sie wyrazic slowami widoki i dzwieki przelatujace przez jego umysl. - Bylem... znowu bylem dzieckiem... plonal dom, byla tam Eurus i ogien odcial mi droge ... to bylo takie realne.

John marszczy brwi. - Istnieja obszary mozgu, gdzie moga zostac wywolane halucynacje podczas napadow padaczki. Z praktyk na neurologii pamietam pacjentow, ktorzy nawet po jakims czasie pamietali swoje projekcje z napadow.

- Ale to bylo realne wspomnienie, John, jestem tego pewien. To bylo prawdziwe. I nie mialem ataku epilepsji, prawda?

- Nie mozemy tego wiedziec bez EEG*  i bez wykluczenia innych rzeczy. Straciles przytomnosc, a nie wszystkie napady kloniczne**  maja objawy toniczne***  To mogl byc jakis napad nieswiadomosci****

- Nie mam epilepsji John. I czy bole glowy nie powinny wystapic po napadzie, a nie przed nim?

- Dlatego potrzebujemy testow, aby wykluczyc inne rzeczy.

- Na przyklad jakie?

- A to juz ci powie neurolog, Sherlock.

- Teraz czuje sie dobrze.

John szuka w kieszeni telefonu komorkowego. - Zdecydowanie nie jest dobrze. Niespodziewanie straciles przytomnosc i doswiadczyles jakiegos znaczacego wydarzenia mozgowego. Jedziemy do szpitala. Natychmiast.

John w krotkich odstepach wybiera trzy cyferki na swoim telefonie i Sherlock wie, ze nie ma sensu sie klocic. Poza tym rozmowa przyprawia go o zawroty glowy.

- Mowi doktor John Watson; jestem przy 467 Hawksmoor Road w Milbury. Potrzebuje erki dla pacjenta do najblizszego szpitala z oddzialem  neurologicznym. Mezczyzna, lat 37,  bez znanej historii chorob neurologicznych. Mial serie podejrzanych atakow z amnezja. Zadnych trudnosci z mowieniem ani zaburzen funkcji motorycznych, ktore bym zauwazyl. Bardzo krotki, niezwykle silny bol glowy typu napadowego przed utrata przytomnosci.

John marszczy brwi, sluchajac dyspozytora. - Tak, teraz jest przytomny, zrenice symetryczne i reaguja na swiatlo, oddycha normalnie...

Jeszcze przez chwile slucha, po czym zwraca sie do Sherlocka.  - Jakis bol w klatce piersiowej?

- Nie.

John ponownie zwraca sie do dyspozytora. - Nie, bez bolu w klatce piersiowej - Kolejna pauza. - Nudnosci?

Sherlock tym razem probuje usiasc, odpychajac rece Johna i unikajac odpowiedzi na pytanie.  - NIC. MI. NIE JEST - przelyka zolc, ktora juz dlawi go w gardle.

John rzuca mu spojrzenie, ktore mogloby zmrozic pieklo, ale niechetnie pomaga Sherlockowi usiasc, sciskajac telefon miedzy uchem a ramieniem. - Co to za skrzyzowanie? - rozglada sie, mruzac oczy, na slupek z nazwami ulic, stojacy na rogu w oddali  - Nie ruszaj sie - rzuca Sherlockowi, po czym szybko biegnie w kierunku rogu. Tyle czasu wystarcza detektywowi. Zrywa sie bez problemu, zachwycony, ze mysli juz jasniej, a zawroty glowy sa znosne.

- Cholera, Sherlock! -  wrzeszczy John za jego plecami, gdy detektyw podchodzi do drzwi.

- To nie jest wlamanie, jesli mamy klucze - mowi nonszalancko.

- To nawet nie jest prawda - wscieka sie John. - Niedlugo tu beda, powinnismy zostac i czekac.

Na kolku z brelokiem nie ma zbyt wielu kluczy, a Sherlock trafia na wlasciwy juz za drugim podejsciem. Drzwi otwieraja sie, ukazujac dlugie schody, z okien powyzej wpada dzienne swiatlo. Sherlock powoli wchodzi do malego przedpokoju, po czym rusza w gore po schodach, ale John rzuca sie do przodu, i chwyta go za ramie. - Zaszedles juz wystarczajaco daleko. Karetka jest w drodze, chodz, zaczekamy na nia na zewnatrz.

- Kiedy zaroi sie tu od policji, juz nigdy nie obejrze tego miejsca - drzwi zamykaja sie za Johnem, przyciagajac wzrok Sherlocka. Klamka jest z postarzanego mosiadzu, ozdobiona drobnymi rozetami. I jeszcze cos. - Dobra. Ujme to inaczej: moze pozwola mi zobaczyc zdjecia tego lokum jako dowod na moim procesie - dodaje ponuro Sherlock, a John odwraca sie, by spojrzec.

- Jezu, to ...

- Krew, tak. Nie sadze, aby zalozenie, ze moje odciski palcow rowniez gdzies tam sa, bylo bardzo nonsensowne.

Tym razem, gdy Sherlock zaczyna wchodzic po schodach, protest Johna sie zmienia. Bez slowa zatrzymuje Sherlocka i wyprzedza go, by objac dowodzenie.

Wchodza cicho po schodach, znajdujac na szczycie ciche, zatechle studio artystyczne. Poranne slonce wlewa sie przez duze okna wzdluz frontowej sciany, oswietlajac pomieszczenie cieplym swiatlem. Latwo jest dostrzec sylwetki sztalug, na wielu z nich jest cos, co wyglada jak obrazy. John mruzy oczy, gdy jego wzrok dostosowuje sie do swiatla otoczenia.

Wyglada na to, ze Sherlockowi wystarczyla ta chwila, zeby sobie cos skojarzyl, gdy obraca sie  powoli by obejrzec przestrzen. - Pamietam to - mruczy pod nosem. - Coz, niezupelnie, ale wydaje sie to zbyt znajome, aby moglo byc zbiegiem okolicznosci.

- Myslisz, ze byles tu wczesniej?

- Moze.

- Sherlock, deja vu moze byc objawem ucisku w placie skroniow ...

- Zamknij sie i daj mi pomyslec!

Znajduja wlacznik swiatla w poblizu schodow i wreszcie moga lepiej przyjrzec sie temu miejscu. Pokoj jest wypelniony plotnami roznych rozmiarow, niektore na sztalugach, inne ulozone pod scianami. Teczowe plamy z farby akrylowej wygladaja jak rozsiane po podlodze konfetti. Rozrzucone pedzle i palety leza na stolach i stolkach.

- Chryste - mowi John, kiedy widza obrazy. Oglada jeden z nich z chorobliwym zdumieniem: krzyczaca meska postac w absolutnej udrece, odrywajaca sobie twarz.- To jak z horroru - cialo, miesnie i sciegna odrywajace sie od kosci sa w jaskrawych, niepokojaco realistycznych barwach. Tlo jest poprzecinane szerokimi, gwaltownymi pociagnieciami czerni, bieli i czerwieni.

Sherlock podchodzi do kolejnej sztalugi, a potem do nastepnej. - Wszystkie sa takie same - mowi, a John rozglada sie, i stwierdza, ze ma racje. Po pracowni jest porozstawiane co najmniej pietnascie niemal identycznych odmian tego samego obrazu, rozniacych sie w zasadzie tylko rozmiarem plotna.

Oboje odwracaja sie do okien, slyszac w oddali nagle wycie syren, kierujace sie  bez watpienia w ich strone.

John odwraca sie w strone schodow, aby zasugerowac, ze zejda na dol, ale jego stopa zaczepia o jakis material. Masa znajomej ciemnej welny z jaskrawoczerwonymi dziurkami, ktora John widzi kazdego dnia.

- Sherlock, to twoj...

I wtedy to widza. Wielka bordowa kaluza akrylowej farby, konczaca sie na samym plaszczu. W niektorych miejscach nadal lsni wilgocia.

Ida po sladzie do zrodla. Ukryte za stolem warsztatowym i rolkami plotna, lezy cialo bardzo martwego mezczyzny. Zaschnieta krew otacza ziejaca rane na jego szyi. Obok jego dloni lezy zakrwawiony noz rzemieslniczy.

Sherlock ciezko wypuszcza powietrze. - Darren Mather, jak przypuszczam.

Syreny slychac juz dole ulicy. Beda tu lada chwila, a obecnie w londynskie karetki sa eskortowane przez policje.

Spojrzenie Sherlocka jest spanikowane. - Wiejemy. Jesli zobacza, ze wyszlismy stad, kiedy go znajda ...

John chwyta go za ramie i kieruja sie na schody. Kiedy zbiegaja, wyciaga komorke i szybko wybiera numer. - Lestrade? Stalo sie cos. Tak, chodzi o Sherlocka. Czy mozesz sie z nami spotkac na oddziale ratunkowym szpitala Royal Claringdon?

It compels me to admit that infants, such as yourself, are no better than me when it comes to depending on John for incessant needs and wants without him expecting anything in return."" 

 

Sherlock's voice sounds soft even to his own ears, resonating around the walls of 221B Baker Street, soft, just like the morning light glowing through the curtains, soft, just like the warmth in his heart. Sherlock picks up the baby in front of him and holds her carefully against his chest. He smiles at the tiny human in his arms. A smile which quickly turns into a glare when he sees John smirking behind him. 

 

""Have you been dyeing your hair darker?""

 

John frowns, unconsciously raising a hand to touch his hair. 

 

""What, you don't like it?"" 

 

""You're losing your natural silver streaks, John."" 

 

John simply huffs crossing his arms: ""Gray hair makes me feel old.""

 

Sherlock can't help but roll his eyes: ""You are old."" 

 

""Thanks. Really appreciate that, Sherlock."" John's voice, dripping with sarcasm is at odds with the self-conscious look in his eyes.

 

Sherlock just frowns, confused: ""What's wrong with getting old? Silver hair is part of ageing. I've got grey hair. It doesn't bother me."" 

 

John swiftly looks away: ""I just don't like it on me. Give me a break."" 

 

Sherlock huffs and bounces the child in his arms, disliking John's new look and preferring the previous one. He doesn't know how John can't realize how perfect he already is. In his arms, the baby moves again and Sherlock looks down and smiles. 

 

""At least you have inherited your mother's eyes and hair. That should compensate for the stubbornness you will most definitely inherit from your father.""

 

""Let's not talk about her, Sherlock. Anyway, today's a big day."" 

 

Sherlock mood immediately drops and he grimaces: ""Nothing is ""big"" about today."" 

 

John puts a hand on Sherlock's shoulder to bend down and picks up a bag at his feet: ""It's my daughter's first time in a daycare. I want you to be there."" 

 

""What is the point?"" 

 

""Babies meet other babies. It's kind of a requirement.""

 

Sherlock gathers the baby closer in his arms.

 

""No, it's not. More to the point, she doesn't need anyone else except you and I.""

 

He can spot John's soft smile on the other side of the room as the other man walks around gathering what they need. 

 

""Well, I don't disagree, but she needs to meet babies, too, you know."" 

 

""Oh, other babies will only decay her mind. She needs to be surrounded by intelligent humans. Like us. Not... mindless and smaller people who drool and cry every hour.""


John sends him a blank look: ""Wow. I can't believe I asked you to help me raise my daughter.""

 

Sherlock pushes away the feeling of pride to a corner of his heart and shrugs: ""I've got nothing else better to do. And besides, what kind of detective would I be if I can't solve cases while changing nappies every once in a while?"" 

 

John simply grins and watches as the detective holds up the baby. She touches Sherlock's face with her small hands and Sherlock's smile could light up the universe.

 

...

 

As soon as Sherlock and John arrive at the daycare center Mycroft enrolled her into, Sherlock can't help the disgusted noise escaping his lips.

 

""Oh, what a pleasant surprise. Children drooling all over the floors. How exciting.""

 

John puts a light but calming hand on Sherlock's forearm: ""I told you. Behave. It's not every day we take breaks from solving cases to spend time with my daughter.""

 

The daycare Lady seems to be a sweet woman. Her bright smile is reassuring when she meets them but Sherlock is too preoccupied with the child in his arms to deduce anything about her: ""Hi! You must be the Watsons, it's a pleasure to meet you both.""

 

Sherlock's heart unexpectedly rises up to his throat. 

 

""The Watsons? No, I am Sherlock Holmes, and this is my friend, Dr. John Watson.""

 

""Uh... yeah. We're here to chaperone my daughter on her first day. Are we late?"" 

 

The woman just smiles knowingly: ""You're just in time, please come with me. Sorry about that. Your daughter is going to enjoy it here. Can she walk already?""

 

John's smile can only be described as fond when he answers: ""Yeah. Sherlock just prefers to carry her.""

 

""What? No. No, it's just safer for her this way. Her limbs are strong and far more developed than most infants, yes, but you can never be too careful."" 

 

""Whatever you say, Sherlock. Just let me do the talking this time."" 

 

The daycare lady shows them around until they reach a room with children around the baby's age: ""Okay, so here we are. You can just let your little girl down over there by the other kids. Everyone here is friendly!""

 

Sherlock takes a step back and is stopped by John's frame behind him, pushing him forward:

 

""No. That boy over there just hid a ribbon belonging to that girl and is currently framing that other boy. I am telling you, John. Other children are as sadistic as the criminals we have encountered in past cases.''

 

John's eyes are bright with amusement but he still sends the daycare lady a contrite smile.

 

""Uh, he's kidding. Of course, he is. Just ignore him, that usually does the trick. Sherlock, your brother went out of his way in offering to get my daughter into a good daycare. The last thing I want is getting kicked out."" 

 

""John, I can definitely handle any type of learning strategy you'd like me to try. Your daughter is smarter than any child here. We don't need to be here.""

 

John takes his friend's arm again to guide him out of earshot after sending the lady an apologetic look.  

 

""Sherlock, I know you're worried about her getting attached to people other than us. There's nothing wrong with that. She'll still like you, she'll still come home with us. She just needs to play with children her own age.""

 

Sherlock casts his eyes away: ""It's not about that.""

 

""Then what is it? Why are you being like this?"" 

 

""I don't want anyone else to influence her other than us two. Other people tend to do that and it affects children until adulthood. Your daughter deserves to be around people who are not strangers to us."" 

 

John stares at Sherlock for a moment, and he laughs. Something bright and full of wonder. Sherlock glares at him but his face heats up.

 

""Oh, Sherlock. You'd be a great father."" 

 

Sherlock softens and looks down, his heart beating fast in his chest. He lets the baby down on the mat. She giggles, crawling up to the other children and starts playing. Sherlock's heart warms. How can someone so small be the source of so much love? He crosses his arms to his chest, already missing the warmth of the child in his arms.

 

""I could be reading the introduction of biochemistry to your daughter right now.""

 

John snorts: ""You really do ignore me when I say that those textbooks aren't bedtime stories, huh?"" 

 

He turns around to look at John, pretending to be offended: ""Those textbooks are educational, John. Unlike the one with a boy climbing a beanstalk that reached the sky, which is scientifically impossible. Something your daughter would know if you let me read to her."" 

 

""Hey, Sherlock? Remember when you used to want to be a pirate?"" 

 

Sherlock draws his shoulders up to his ears, hiding behind the collar of his coat as he feels his face heat again: ""Shut up, John."" 

 

Sherlock sees the parents smile at their own children. It makes him look at John's daughter as well, and he watches her giggle with another baby girl while holding a stuffed horse toy.

 

""You've got to admit, Sherlock, that's cute."" John bumps his shoulder, eyes filled with mirth.  

 

""I would never use the word ""cute"" for anyone other than your daughter."" 

 

John stays silent for a beat and Sherlock tries hard not to look at him, wondering if he said something wrong again. He hears a crisp intake of breath as John seems to collect himself: ""Yeah, but they're cute. Look at her playing with the little horse! Take a photo right now, Sherlock."" 

 

""John, I swear to God. It's as if you enjoy seeing me suffer."" 

 

He can feel his friend closer to his ear as he whispers: ""Do it, or I'll call over those parents to sit next to us.""

 

John is clearly enjoying the way Sherlock is grimacing as he snaps pictures of John's daughter with his phone. If Sherlock takes every picture making sure to voice his complaints, he knows he will never delete them. 

 

""There. Are you happy?""

 

By his side, John is laughing quietly, and Sherlock tries his best to suppress his own smile.

 

""I'm glad I could be of some amusement to you."" 

 

""Come on, just admit it. You like seeing her happy.""

 

Sherlock frowns slightly: ""It's not like I want to see her cry, John. Noise is already an abundance in Baker Street."" 

 

John's voice is barely more than a whisper as he looks at his friend: ""You love her. I know you do.""

 

Well, I love you, Sherlock thinks, but he knows it would be a bit not good to voice it out loud. Especially when everything has been going so well lately.

 

""I can't possibly hate anything that is half you."" 

 

John's breath seems to catch again and Sherlock casts a quick glance his way to find John straightening his shoulders, a faint blush to his cheeks: ""Oh... right. W-Well, that... that's nice of you.""

 

Sherlock and John sit in silence, just watching the baby giggle and play with the others, the noises around them filling the sudden void between them, noises around them, clinging to the words hanging between them, remaining unsaid, as always.

 

John clears his throat and it sounds deafening even in the loud room. He looks down at his hands, avoiding his friend's inquisitive look:

 

""Hm. Isn't this nice? Just two friends. Watching a baby together during their day off.""

 

Sherlock almost grimaces, he turns his head forward looking aimlessly off in the distance:  

 

""Yes, absolutely. Two friends."" 

 

""Well, I can definitely say I never imagined raising her with you, of all people.""

 

Sherlock's head whips around so fast he could've broken his neck:  

 

""What is that supposed to mean?"" he asks, almost offended, ""You think I cannot raise a child?"" 

 

John pales, a nervous hand raking through his hair: ""No, that's not it. I just meant that... you're you and I'm me. I always thought I'd... you know.""

 

Sherlock is just confused now. He straightens and imperceptibly moves away from John's side, hurt.  

 

""No, I don't."" 

 

""Come on, Sherlock. It's been months. I think you know."" 

 

Sherlock frowns at his friend sudden desperation:

 

""Know what?"" 

 

His friend's shoulders visibly sag: ""Never mind.""

 

""No, say what you were going to say.""

 

Still avoiding his friend's eyes, John hesitantly opens his mouth to say something but before any sound can escape it they are distracted by a loud and familiar cry coming from the small crowd. Sherlock almost flies away from his spot to kneel next to John's daughter, panic seizing up his insides. He carefully but frantically checks if she is hurt.

 

""She's fine, Sherlock, but I can't find the horse toy she was playing with.""

 

Sherlock lets out a relieved breath he didn't realize he was holding.  

 

""A toy? She is crying over a toy? Do babies cry over toys a lot?"" 

 

""Says the person who threw a tantrum over hidden cigarettes."" John mumbles, and then louder: ""Go get the toy."" 

 

""It's not here, John."" 

 

John's voice rises: ""Well, bloody look for it, then!"" 

 

They both gain some curious look and Sherlock continues with a loud whisper: ""A missing horse toy. How fascinating. You should write up your account of this excellent case, John."" 

 

John ignores him and turns to his daughter: ""It's okay, darling. Uncle Sherlock's got a plan."" 

 

""This is tedious. Looking for a toy. How did she even lose it? It isn't like the horse can run away. Although, I would understand the urge."" 

 

""Did you find it?"" 

 

""No."" 

 

John raises a challenging eyebrow that Sherlock finds incredibly unnerving: ""You're Sherlock Holmes and you can't find a baby's toy?"" 

 

""Why don't you go look for it, then?"" 

 

""Ooh, if I find it, I'm forever going to hold this against you."" 

 

""Well? Did you find it?""

 

""No..."" John looks around, eyes stopping on every child trying to spot the missing toy: ""But it's probably with some other kid now.""

 

Sherlock huffs and glares at his friend. He knew all of this was a bad idea. And he is always right. ""It is your fault that we are here. Now, your daughter can't even stop crying.""

 

""Stop complaining, you're making it worse."" 

 

The daycare lady appears next to them and addresses Sherlock with a worried look: ""Is there a problem here, Mr Watson?""

 

""Yes, it is entirely possible that one of the offspring here has stolen a toy from my friend's daughter.""

 

John swiftly finds his way between them pointing a finger to his friend:

 

""He's not Mr Watson.""

 

Sherlock ignores the sudden but fierce ache in his chest.

 

""Also, Sherlock, it's just ""children"" and maybe one of them just borrowed it. I'm sure she can find another.""

 

""If it is a horse she wants, then it is a horse she should get."" 

 

Sherlock reaches over to hold the baby's hand, and he hushes her quietly, trying to calm the heartbreaking cries. He can see John smiling fondly behind him.

 

""They're babies, go easy on them."" 

 

Sherlock shakes his head in displeasure: ""They are still thieves if they decide to take the horse from her. It is unacceptable.""

 

John simply laughs. A genuine sound that seems to surprise both of them. Sherlock frowns at him, he can't understand anything he does can make John so genuinely happy. He's been more and more genuinely happy around him these days.

 

""This is not a laughing matter, John! Your daughter is crying!"" 

 

John's eyes are shining so bright when he looks down at them Sherlock's breath catches in wonder: ""No, I know, I know, you just... you're so protective. It's... it's nice.""

 

""Now is simply not the time to be nice because I can spot the white horse in that child's hands. Excuse me."" 

 

Sherlock stands, a determined look on his face John recognizes to be one usually reserved to the worst criminals.

 

""Sherlock, no, no, no, no. Wait!"" 

 

Sherlock bends down to be eye to eye with the culprit.

 

""Hello. You are holding the toy that was initially with that child over there. Can you hand it over?"" 

 

""Sherlock, you can't just take the toy from him."" He glances around, taking in the increasingly mad amount of parents around them: ""Jesus. I'm sorry about my friend, he's just very... protective.""

 

Sherlock ignores him and grips the toy still in the child's hand.

 

""I can and I will. Now, give it.""

 

John can immediately spot the glossy eyes of the child and the rapidly increasing breathing as a storm coming and tries to take Sherlock away from the kid:  

 

""Look, you're going to make him cry! Let's just find her another toy, come on. There's a little sheep over there, we can try that."" He looks down at the child: ""I'm really sorry for my friend here, he's just, you know... trying to be a good parent."" 

 

Sherlock looks away: ""I'm not a parent. I'm a... concerned uncle.""

 

John gives his daughter back to Sherlock. He holds her carefully and she immediately curls up to him and stops crying. The soft hums she lets out as she leans on Sherlock lights a bright light in his chest. He feels like everything is burning inside him. When has everything become so warm? How did he manage to live when everything was so cold? 

 

""I think my daughter loves her concerned uncle very much."" 

 

""Oh, shut up, John.""

 

""You're enjoying this."" 

 

""Enjoying what?"" 

 

John's voice is so incredibly gentle when he answers: ""Being a dad."" 

 

Something unfurls and blooms in Sherlock's chest, growing around his lungs and flowering in his throat and in his heart. He softens again and holds John's daughter closer to inhale her familiar scent.

 

""I don't know what you mean."" He hides a smile behind the child's hair.  

 

John laughs and watches Sherlock put the baby down again to let her crawl to some other toys.

 

""This isn't so bad, hm? Just the two of us, watching her play."" John says as Sherlock stands up again beside him.

 

""I admit, this isn't entirely a traumatic experience.""

 

Sherlock and John watch the giggling child together, both of them are smiling proudly.  

 

John takes a deep breath and seems to ponder for a moment too long, Sherlock immediately tenses up in expectation:

 

""Remember when you said that your name was a girl's name?"" 

 

The world seems to suddenly come to a stand still. All noises around them muted but for the sound of Sherlock's own breath.

 

Sherlock clears his throat, trying to appear nonchalant as the walls of his mind scrumble, close to collapsing: ""Yes. What about it?""

 

""Was that really what you wanted to say?""

 

""John, that was months ago"" Sherlock sighs. 

 

""That didn't really answer my question. What did you want to say?"" 

 

Sherlock takes interest in the floor beneath their feet, in the colourful paintings on the wall, in the blue sky out of the window: ""It doesn't really matter now, surely."" 

 

John sees immediately through the feigned disinterest: ""Maybe it does. You don't know. We never really talked about it. It's been almost a year."" 

 

""You'd prefer to discuss this inside a daycare centre?"" 

 

John's eyebrows rase to his hairline in victory: ""So, there's something to discuss, then?"" 

 

""Yes, maybe there is. You should stop dyeing your hair darker.""

 

John touches his hair again: ""The silver hair thing is just weird. I feel older."" 

 

""It's not a bad thing. Everyone gets old. We've been dying the moment we were born.""

 

John gets closer to him, very slowly, almost imperceptibly, definitely deliberately. Their arms brush against each other.

 

""You're really not letting this go, are you?"" 

 

""Not until you stop dyeing your hair."" 

 

Looking far off the distance, Sherlock can still feel the look of his friend on his face, on his neck, seemingly avoiding his eyes, before stopping on his curly hair. He is not close enough and it still feels suffocating.

 

""It would suit you, you know? The full silver hair, not just the small ones."" 

 

""What, do you think we should switch hair colours now? Don't be absurd, John.""

 

""No, I think we should grow old together."" 

 

Sherlock is startled by the words, and he slowly turns to John who has a calm smile on his face as he watches his daughter. As if what he just said isn't momentous, as if what he just said is evident, as if it didn't shake Sherlock's whole world from its axis. Just them, the two of them against the rest of the world. Until the end. Sherlock stares at him with soft eyes, and with an even softer glow in his chest back yet again.

 

...

 

On the way home, Sherlock stays quiet and just carries the tired little girl in his arms. They reach Baker Street, and Sherlock puts the child to sleep. He rocks the crib as he observes her sleep, her small hands, her eyes, her little nose. His smile turns sad as he lets his fingers brush against her tiny head.

 

""I wonder what your name will be.""

 

He smiles before leaning down to kiss the top of her head lingering for a while. 

 

""Thank you for this wonderful day, Miss Watson. Maybe one day, you and I will do this again, my dear Watson.""

 

Sherlock takes in the room he prepared for her and stares longingly at the baby one last time before quietly closing the door and walking down the stairs. In the living room, he watches John standing by the fireplace, seemingly lost in his thoughts. Feeling the gaze of his friend on his back, John looks up to stare at Sherlock through the mirror.

 

""John, I've been thinking. Don't you think we've seen enough?"" 

 

John's expression is serene but curious as he turns around to face him: ""Enough of what?"" 

 

""Crime, danger. Solving cases. Do you think it's possible in the future that we would have seen enough?""

 

John frowns: ""You saying we should stop?"" 

 

Sherlock has never been the self-conscious kind but he feels the need to cross his arms to protect himself from being too vulnerable:

 

""Well, not right away, of course. I have been thinking about what you said earlier. When we're ready, maybe we can... go elsewhere."" 

 

John takes a step closer: ""Ready for what?"" 

 

""To be in content with each other.""

 

John's smile could light up the entire room: ""Alright, madman. Where should we go?"" 

 

""I heard that Sussex is a good place for cottages. Maybe I can garden, or become a beekeeper. Who knows?""

 

John laughs at the idea, and Sherlock smiles fondly.

 

""It's just a thought, John. Maybe an ordinary life won't be so bad. All it takes is a good companion."" 

 

""Sounds like a plan, Sherlock. I'll think about it."" 

 

""We still need to raise your daughter here. You have decades to think about it. I will wait. In any case, I've always wondered how to take care of bees."" 

 

""I was joking, Sherlock. Of course, I'd come with you. The two of us against the rest of the world, remember?""

 

Only there are three of us now isn't there, Sherlock can't help but think.

 

""So, back to what we were talking about earlier. Is ""Sherlock"" really a girl's name?"" 

 

Sherlock averts his eyes but he feels strangely at peace with the sentence now: ""I think we both know what I truly meant.""

 

John steps even closer: ""Maybe I do. Maybe it can be something that's only between the two of us."" 

 

Sherlock stares into the familiar deep blue eyes and sees everything he feels reflected in them: ""I wouldn't want it in any other way.""

 

Sherlock and John smile softly at one another. And it was enough for them both. No one else mattered. Only the two of them and the family they have made.

 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

 

''This was a nice change of scene. It should make up for the last one. You did put me in very weird clothes.''

 

Something deflates inside of Sherlock. He takes a look at his friend, and at the walls of 221B seemingly moving with a gentle sway, cradled by a continuous humming sound.

 

""Don't complain, John. Pretend it was Halloween.""

 

John laughs, and Sherlock smiles, something small and broken while watching the crinkles form at the corner of John's eyes.

 

His friend's smile is soft when he looks at Sherlock again:


 


""I had a lovely day, Sherlock.""

 

""I did as well.""

 

""But I think you have something more important to work on right now.""

 

Sherlock can feel the walls around him bounce again even as John stays unmoving. His throat tight, his voice a choked sound as he whispers, dejected:

 

""John... I'm sorry. I tried. I didn't mean to wait so long.""


 


""I know, but you can always come back here.""

 

Sherlock stares at John, an ever calming presence in the chaos of his complicated emotions. He feels a sting at the back of his eyes and realizes he can feel his own eyes fill with tears. Sherlock looks at the mirror to avoid John's eyes.


 


""I am never going to have this life, am I?"" he murmured.

 

John offers an apologetic smile, and he reaches over to take Sherlock's hands into his own. Sherlock looks down to focus on the hand on his. Storing away the feeling.


 


""It was a good run. You had all the details perfect. Even the teacher called us the Watsons.""


 


""Actually, it was Mycroft's enrollment. Seemed like something he would do.""


 


""See? Details. That's good storytelling. I think, as a storyteller, I would be impressed.""

 

Sherlock smiles ruefully at John, clutching their hands tighter, holding on to the feeling while it lasts. John sighs and he stands so close Sherlock can almost feel it on his face. He closes his eyes briefly.

 

""He needs you.""


 


Sherlock's head hangs low.

 

""I know he does, but every once in a while, I wish that he didn't. Things would be much easier.""

 

Even as he voices it out loud, he knows it to be a lie. John sees right through it.


 


""Would it?""

 

""No. No, it wouldn't. I need him to need me. It is the only way I can keep him in my life.""


 


""Well, then. Now that that's out of the way, maybe now you can work on trying to find stuffed animals better.""

 

Sherlock tearfully laughs and just stares at what he could have had if he stopped waiting. He feels the ghost of John's free hand on his face raking through his hair slowly.

 

""Come back to me, Sherlock.""

 

""I will miss you, John."" Sherlock sniffs.


 


""You don't have to miss me. You'll come back here, right?""

 

Sherlock shakes his head: ""No, I won't. I can't. Distractions won't be good. Not with the new crisis waiting for me out there. I need to protect them.""


 


""Well, in that case, maybe you'll find out what our daughter's name is.""

 

Sherlock's heart shatters a little more and he has to bring his free hand to his sternum to try and ease the pain.

 

""She's not our daughter. She will never be our daughter. She was never mine. However, she's half you. Mine or not, she's my family.""

 

John smiles at Sherlock, staring at the small silver decorating his detective's hair.

 

""Good luck, Sherlock. I hope you'll remember your vow.""

 

...

 

Sherlock opens his eyes and finds himself in an awfully familiar car. John and Mary are staring at him with a concern that makes something seize up in his throat. It takes him a few minutes to acknowledge John's hand is on his trying to gently shake him.


 


""You okay? You've been blabbering about a missing horse for a second there."" John asks, voice filled with worry.

 

He tries hard to ignore Mary's sceptical eyebrow: ""Those aren't the only things he said. I still think we should take him to the hospital, John. He could still be hallucinating or something.""

 

Sherlock stares at Mary and looks at her stomach for a moment. His heart drops, and he looks away.

 

For days, Sherlock was so sure he was to die in six months, which is why he did what he did... because Sherlock is the type of person who can never be killed by anyone except by himself. Now that he is back, the only thing he dreads is to watch John grow out his silver hair and raise his daughter with someone else.


 


""No, Moriarty's back. We should be prepared."" Sherlock mumbles, trying to regain some composure. He can't allow himself to be weak, nor to be vulnerable.

 

John's voice is too filled with concern to be described as angry: ""Are you even in a fit state? Look at yourself! How many times did you even go to that bloody mind palace of yours in the span of an hour?""

 

Sherlock stares at John, noticing how his hair is back to his natural blonde colour. Sherlock's chest twists but he flashes him the genuine bright smile he only reserves for his best friend.

 

""I'm fine, John. Have you done something new with your hair? You look marvellous.""

 

John brings a self-conscious hand to his hair and the gesture, so familiar, threatens to overcome Sherlock with the intensity of the feeling it causes. This longing again. He swears he can see a faint blush on John's cheeks.

 

""My hair? What... What are you on about? And, no, you're not fine. We should get you to the hospital.""

 

Sherlock ignores him once again and straightens up in the car, attempting to regain a semblance of composure.

 

""The stage is set, the curtain rises. Moriarty returns and chaos will soon follow. Now is not the time to daydream pathetically about what could have been.""


 


""What do you mean? Daydream?""

 

John's frown of confusion is at odds with Mary's somewhat suspicious and knowing look.

 

""Come along, John! We have a case to discuss! Moriarty's impatience will take effect soon. We shouldn't waste time.""


 


""Sherlock, please. Talk to me. How do you even know you're okay?""


 


""Because, John, between you and me, I always survive the fall.""

 

Sherlock winks because he needs to pretend he is fine, because he needs to pretend he is human, because he needs to pretend he is doing better. He exits the car and closes the door with much more force than expected. John and Mary share a confused look. John sighs, following Sherlock into 221B. Because that's what he does.

 

In the car, Mary frowns and her hand is securely placed on the bump of her stomach. The car starts rolling again and takes her to the home she and her husband share.

""John? John Watson?"" Mike says from the park bench he's sitting on. ""It's me. Mike Stamford, from Bart's. I know, I got fat."" He chuckles.

""Yes, hello,"" John says automatically, without registering who Mike was. His mind had been elsewhere, worry dragging him down even as the sun shined around him. Oh, Mike!

Recognition flickered across his face. Making a vague comment about the weight gain, he stuck out his hand. ""Been a while. Alright?""

""Same old same old. Working at Bart's."" Mike smiles and shakes John's hand. ""Teaching bright young things like we used to be. God, I hate them."" He chuckles. ""Last I heard you were off getting shot somewhere. What happened with that?""

""I got shot,"" John says tersely, his hand reflexively reaching for his leg, despite the wound being in his shoulder. ""Just got back, though I can't afford London. Not on an Army pension.""

""Couldn't stand to be anywhere else,"" Mike smirks and follows John to get a coffee and catch up.

""Mmm, Harry's no help either."" Pursing his lips John feels his pocket for spare change, then passes a few coins over to a vendor selling coffee and tea to other park patrons. ""Have you tried finding a flatshare? Impossible these days, not like in Uni.""

""You're the second person to say that to me today."" Mike takes a sip from his steaming cup.

""Second?"" Glancing in surprise at his old friend John follows Mike's lead and takes a sip from his still too hot coffee, burning his mouth in the process. ""Who else?""

Sherlock growls as he whips the corpse mercilessly, matching the speed, strength, and intensity as much as he could from the body at the crime scene. He looks up when the door opens, seeing Molly giving him that mousy wide-eyed stare.

Later Sherlock looks up when the lab door opens, seeing Mike Stamford come in with a man walking with a cane. ""Fancier than when we were here."" Mike chuckles.

John mutters something that even he couldn't discern and gave Mike one of those polite smiles you give when you bump into someone you vaguely remember at the grocery store.

He scans the room, noticing how correct Mike's words were. Back in his day, Bart's had been able to boast having all the best equipment, and it seemed that hadn't changed over the years.However, halfway through his inspection, he saw a man hunched over one of the tables, a dropper full of clear liquid in one hand.""Is that him?"" he wondered.

""Mike, can I borrow your phone? I can't get a signal."" Sherlock says, looking Mike and the mystery man over.

Mike feels his pockets. ""Sorry. Left it in my coat.""

""Uh, here, use mine?"" John said, offering before his mind had time to catch up to his words.The man walked towards him, his full height evident as he slid off the stool.

He wasn't wearing a lab coat, or the tattier clothing favoured by broke med students. Instead, he was in a two-piece suit, the collar a crisp white shirt hugging his chin.

The collar hid the man's neck from John, but he didn't have to look to know there wouldn't be a bite there. The man was oozing alpha, from the way he walked to the arrogant set of his shoulders.

John gripped his cane tightly in his hand while holding out his mobile as the man approached.Mike, an Alpha? Seriously? John thought, glancing furiously over a Mike who just smiled at him.

""Afghanistan or Iraq?"" Sherlock asks as he types furiously.

""Afghanistan, wait how did you know?"" John stared, mouth gaping open as the cold words hit him. It had been a common enough question in the army, soldiers sizing each other up, looking to see who had the better stories.

""How?"" He repeated, once again glancing over to Mike, wondering if perhaps Mike had given Sherlock a heads up. Mike shakes his head and raises his hands to show his innocence.

""Everything about you screams military. The way you walk, talk and breathe. When you entered you surveyed the entire room but not to see what had changed but for threats. You may be overly cautious but your posture and hair cut give you away. Your face and hands are tanned but it's less so under your cuffs and collar. Buttoned up tight somewhere with a lot of sun and military posturing. Mike made a comment that a lot has changed since your day so Military doctor then. Only two choices with sunny active military conflict, Afghanistan or Iraq."" Sherlock finishes sending his text and hands the phone back. He looks the man over, taking in the psychosomatic limp. Interesting

""If you'll both excuse me I have to go down to the morgue, left my riding crop."" Sherlock pulls on his coat and heads for the door. ""We'll look at the flat tomorrow.""

""Look at the flat? I don't even know where it is, or anything about you? I can tell you're an Alpha, but nothing else.""

John groaned as he glared daggers at Mike who smiles apologetically. ""I don't even have your number.""

""You know that I wouldn't be here if I didn't know what I was doing and that I wouldn't observe everything about you without quite the impressive intellect. You need a flat and I have my eye on the place. Together we should be able to afford it. The name is Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street. Good day."" Sherlock winks and he's gone.

""Yeah. He's always like that."" Mike chuckles.

""He's... intense."" John sighs, scratching his eyebrow. ""Bit off-kilter for an alpha to just take up lodging with someone, without... asking. Did you tell him?""

""Swear to god, I haven't said a word. That's yours to tell, not mine."" Mike said as they walked out of the lab together.

""Right... ta.""

Going to see the flat...

Sherlock pays the cabbie as it stops outside 221B the next day. ""Afternoon."" He says as he gets out of the cab. ""Found the place alright?""

""Mr. Holmes,"" John says, sticking out his hand in greeting. Inwardly he kicked himself. The omega in him knew that Alphas preferred it when Omegas didn't use first names, but John was no ordinary omega. He'd spent years tamping down his secondary biology and was not about to stop just because there was a tall, and admittedly gorgeous Alpha staring down at him.

""Please, call me Sherlock."" Sherlock shakes John's hand, feeling the calluses from well-trained hands. ""We'll be pretending to be a couple after all."" He says as the door opens.

""Oh Sherlock! Come in!"" Mrs. Hudson cooed and shuffled them inside.

""Wait wha-?"" John manages to squeak out before his voice and confusion is drowned out by who he could only presume was the landlady.

Much to John's dismay, they were led up a flight of old wooden stairs. Sherlock bounded up the steps with ease, but John and the older lady both took their time, finding Sherlock already flitting about the cluttered lounge.

""This is quite nice,"" John says, looking around at the clutter, pointing his cane at the fireplace in particular. ""Once we get some of this stuff removed.""

""I... I can tidy."" Sherlock starts to clean up piles.

""Sherlock says you're an army doctor. Thank you for your service. There's two bedrooms if you'll need it."" Mrs. Hudson smiles.

""Of course we'll be needing two bedrooms,"" John begins to say. A loud thud, Sherlock slamming a book down on a table, drew his attention to the Alpha. Sherlock glared at him, and it was only then that John remembered his words about pretending to be a couple.

""I uh, have terrible nightmares most nights. War, and all that.""

Narrowing his eyes he watches as Sherlock returns to stacking books and piles of papers.What the hell is that about? Pretend to be a couple?

""Oh good. It's much easier to rent to couples. Not having all kinds through the house all hours of the day and night."" Mrs. Hudson nods. ""The constant coming and going between unbound Alphas is astonishing. My home is not a brothel.""

""Tea, Mrs. Hudson?"" Sherlock asks as a diversion.

""Not your housekeeper, dear. Just this once."" Mrs. Hudson says as she heads to the kitchen.

Sherlock goes to John. ""The listing is for a couple because she is not able to keep an eye on singles anymore. And they are more likely to be destructive to the property. She's been considering having a hip replacement and I'd much rather be here to assist her without her fussing over it. So if you would please play along this arrangement is beneficial for both of us, John."" He whispers, his height looming over John, not in the usual overpowering aggressive alpha way but more of a protective shielding from everything else.

""You could have mentioned this earlier,"" John hissed though his words got caught in his throat when Sherlock whispered the monthly rent.

""I suppose I can try..."" God, it was cheap. Cheaper than the bedsit he'd been assigned when he'd returned to London. Between his pension, and whatever it was Sherlock made, surely they could afford the flat, with more than enough to spare for food. It wasn't ideal, lodging with an alpha. But John had suppressants at his side and a lifetime worth of ignoring alphas.

""It won't be that hard to pretend. I never bring anyone home and most people keep their distance from me anyway. We just live together. You get a cheap flat in central London and Mrs. Hudson lays off me to find a mate so I can focus on my Work."" Sherlock nods.

""And what work is that?"" John began to ask, but he was interrupted by the landlady who poked her head into the sitting room.

Just until I'm on my feet. John tells himself, moving a stack of papers from the seat a plush armchair he plopped down hard. With a sigh, he stretches out his bad leg and watches as Sherlock continues to flutter about moving one stack of belongings to another location without really cleaning anything up.

""Milk and sugar, Dr. Watson?"" Mrs. Hudson asks.

Outside a car pulls up as Sherlock watches out the window. The door downstairs opens and hurried footsteps on the stairs make their way into the room.

""Where?"" Sherlock asks as a man enters the flat.

""Brixton, Lauriston Gardens."" The man says.

""What's new? You wouldn't come to get me if there wasn't anything new."" Sherlock slips his hands into his trouser pockets.

""You know how they never leave notes? This one did."" The man says. ""Will you come?""

""Not in a panda car. I'll be right behind."" Sherlock nods and the man leaves.

Sherlock jumps around in glee. ""It's Christmas!""

John watches with mild confusion at the scene around him. The newcomer looked familiar, though he couldn't place where or how he would have seen the man. He'd only just arrived in London and hadn't been social.

Once they hear the door shut downstairs, Sherlock begins dashing about, muttering under his breath about ""Anderson, I won't work with him.""

""Make yourself at home, don't wait up,"" Sherlock says, twining his scarf around his neck then dashing down the stairs.

""Always dashing about. But you're more of the sitting down type,"" Mrs. Hudson says.

""Damn my leg!"" John shouts, frustrated with his own limitations. There was something intoxicating in Sherlock's energy that made him want to follow after the Alpha and see what the commotion was about.""

""Sorry... sorry,"" he mutters, though the landlady brushes it off and offers once again to make tea.

""Biscuits too, if you've got them,"" John calls after her, flicking a nearby newspaper open. There on the front page, beside a write-up of the serial suicides, is a picture of D.I. Lestrade, the same man who'd just been in the flat talking with Sherlock.

""You're a doctor. An army doctor. Seen a lot of injuries? Violent deaths? Bit of trouble too I'd imagine."" Sherlock pushes himself off the doorframe and walks over to John. ""Want to see some more?""

John stands, not enjoying the feeling of an Alpha he hardly knows looming over him. Sherlock had a few inches on him, but John knew how to make the most of his body.

Squaring his shoulders he forced himself not to step back when Sherlock encroached on his personal space.

""Enough for a lifetime,"" John replies, then adds, ""Oh god, yes.""

Sherlock smirks and sweeps out of the room, down the stairs.

""Sorry, Mrs. Hudson,"" John calls as he hobbles after the much faster man. ""Off Out,""

That evening is the most fun John had in years. It was even better than his first night in Afghanistan, though not having the constant fear of being shot by insurgents might have had something to do with that.

The evening flashed by, a series of vibrant memories that would stay with John forever. It ended with Sherlock being driven to a college, by the killer. A Taxi driver, no less. His profession allows him to blend in to any crowd.

Following in a separate cab, John has Sherlock's wifi-enabled laptop on his lap, with his mobile pressed to his ear. Desperately trying to get through the series of bored police officers stuck behind a desk.

""DI Lestrade, PLEASE."" John hisses, the urgency in his voice is evident. His heart felt like someone had gripped it with icy fingers.

Eventually, he gets patched through, and John's relieved the DI remembers him. He quickly explains the situation, ends the call, and reaches for the gun in his pocket. It's there, loaded, and ready to go. Not wanting to upset his cab driver, John leaves it where it is.

There are two buildings, both swathed in darkness with only a few lights on here and there by emergency exits. It's a 50/50 shot, and John hopes he's picked the right choice.

He isn't sure why he cares so much about this mad man, a stranger really. But there's something about the Alpha, perhaps just the promise of danger and adventure, that makes John want to hold the man close and never let him go.

John rushes through the empty hall, pushing open unlocked doors, shouting Sherlock's name. Urgency is the key here, not stealth. He chances to look out one of the windows overlooking the other building, the one he did not enter. And sees it.

Sees Sherlock. He's sat at a table, across from the cab driver. The distance is great enough that he can't read their lips, but he is able to see two vials laid out on the table and a gun in the cabbie's hands. John's heart all but stops beating in his chest, time freezes as Sherlock's name rips its way from his throat.

It's over before John has time to think about it. His gun is in his hands, he's used a nearby object to smash in the window. Taking a deep breath, he focuses, then pulls the trigger.

Sherlock rushes to the window as soon as the cabbie drops to see who the shooter was but there was no one to be seen. He goes back to the cabbie and presses his shoe to the man's wound. ""Who! Who is your patron!"" He demanded.

With the cabbie's dying breath he screams ""Moriarty!""

Finally, when he MET and paramedics show up Sherlock is led out. ""What is this? Why've I got this on me?"" Sherlock tugs at the shock blanket around his shoulders.

""It's for shock."" DI Lestrade answers.

""I'm not in shock."" Sherlock scowls.

""I know but some of the lads wanted to take pictures."" Lestrade chuckles. ""So what can you tell me about the shooter?""

As Sherlock is rattling off his deductions he stops, seeing John standing across the police tape looking as normal and ordinary as could be bit Sherlock knew he was anything but.

""Ignore me. Ignore all that."" Sherlock says and stands.

""What?"" Lestrade looks up from his boat road he'd been furiously writing in.

""You can't believe a word I say right now. I'm in shock. See, I've got a blanket."" Sherlock heads to John.

""Where are you going? We still need a statement!"" Lestrade scolds.

""I'll bring him in myself tomorrow. But he needs a meal and sleep. He was kidnapped by a serial killer after all."" John quips.

""Only a fool argues with his doctor,"" Sherlock says smoothly.

""Fine but both of you in my office first thing in the morning,"" Lestrade says as he watches them walk off.

Sherlock holds the police tape for John to duck under.

The gesture is kind and puts a smile on John's face even as Sherlock begins questioning him about powder burns on his fingers.

John's head is still swimming from the compliment *Good Shot*

It had been a good shot, a bloody good shot.

He falls into step beside the giggling Alpha as they leave the scene of flashing lights behind them.

""Dinner?""

""Starving,"" John replies easily, though part of him wonders if that is the *Alpha* talking, or the Man, Sherlock Holmes. He isn't sure which he wants to be asking, but he has a sneaking suspicion it isn't the purely male side.

Sherlock gets a call about multiples alpha bodies and an omega in the center of it all....

Sherlock was shocked at how easy it was to fall into a routine with John. He was worried living with another person would be catastrophic to his thinking not to mention the work but John was different. John made his mind sharper, thinking faster, deductions brighter. He hadn't felt this stable in years or as euphoric without the feeling of a needle piercing his flesh. This was different. He felt like he was soaring and falling all at once but it didn't matter if John was there watching and praising his work.

Sherlock heard Mrs. Hudson's footsteps come up to the flat and he rushed from the table to the couch where John was sitting. He lifted John's laptop from his lap and replaced it with his head, putting John's hand in his hair. He closes his eyes just in time for Mrs. Hudson to walk in with the mail.

""Oi, I was using that."" John grumped, hands still hovering in the air above where his keyboard had been. Instead, he found his fingers hovering directly over Sherlock's mop of curls. That's right, we're pretending to be a couple. This is what couples do.

Anxiety pierced through John at the contact. He was between suppressants. No longer able (allowed) to use the military-grade suppressants he had been on, he had to wait before swapping over to the generics from the chemists. He'd been careful, using special soaps aimed at hiding an Omega's scent, but with Sherlock this close, it was dangerous. Especially because he had no clue just how strong the Alpha's senses were.

With his own abilities repressed, John's sense of smell had been reduced to that of a beta. Normal, and dull, unable to smell Alphas or pick out their unique scents. It would come back, eventually, if he stopped his suppressants, but this had been his life for as long as he could remember.

Two things would happen if Sherlock found out.

One: He would be forced into a bond, simply because Sherlock's Alpha brain would kick in, and demand that the unbound omega finally belong to someone

Two: Sherlock would kick him out for legal reasons. Alphas were not supposed to lodge with unbound Omegas unless they were already bound, and for one reason or another, their bound mate couldn't produce children. Then, it was acceptable for an alpha to invite a second omega into their home, whose purpose would be to become a surrogate parent. (And quite often, more simply put a fuck toy.)

The thought of not being here, at baker street, made his heartache. In the months since moving in, he'd grown to enjoy the flat and the company.

""Morning, boys. Got your mail here."" Mrs. Hudson sets the mail on the table. ""Aren't you two the picture of domestic bliss?"" She coos as she sees them.

""John's proximity helps me think."" Sherlock mumbles, keeping up the ruse had been a bit of a struggle at first. But Sherlock had observed that John was settling into their arrangement which made things easier. He ignored how intoxicating it was to have John's fingers in his hair.

""You two are just so precious. Much nicer than Mrs. Turner's married ones I'll tell you."" Mrs. Hudson nods.

""Uhh, thanks?"" John says, wishing Sherlock's hair didn't feel oh so very soft beneath his fingers.

""Are her married ones... betas?"" He asks, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible. So far neither Sherlock or Mrs. Hudson had asked about his secondary biology, which had been a breath of fresh air, and he wondered if that was because he was in a mostly beta neighborhood.

Mrs. Hudson nods. ""Mrs. Turner says they're thinking of moving out. Want a bigger place to have a family. She says they keep her up all night, bed frame squeaking and all that."" She tsks. ""I'm so lucky you boys are so considerate. Barely heard a peep out of you. You know I take my herbal soothers in the evenings so don't let me be a hindrance."" She winks at John.

""Yes well, with the bedroom upstairs I imagine that helps keep things, erm, quiet."" John offers while willing his traitorous fingers to stop moving. But they don't, so he sighs and gives into it, at least for as long as their landlady is upstairs.

I should tell him that I'm an Omega. Before his prat of a brother finds out. I was promised it was all locked away, but who knows how high his clearance goes.

Instead, he clears his throat and pats Sherlock on the shoulder.

""Scootch,"" he says, trying to make his voice sound sympathetic like a lover might. ""Need the loo.""

Sherlock sighs dramatically but obliges, letting John up.

Mrs. Hudson chats with Sherlock about her next doctor's appointment while he tries to convince her to get the hip transplant.

John didn't actually have to use the loo. But he couldn't just sit there, petting Sherlock's hair and pretending to be madly in love. He'd noticed, while Mrs. Hudson had been drabbling on about the neighbours, that a faint scent of leather had reached his nose. His senses trying to come back online while in between brands of suppressants. Between the scent and the feeling of Sherlock's hair, he'd wanted to curl forward and bury his nose in the crook of Sherlock's neck. The Alpha smelled amazing, intoxicating even.

He wanted to lean forward and bury his nose in the hollow below Sherlock's adam's apple. He wanted to glide his nose along that sharp jawline, and those tempting freckles dusting across pale skin.

""Get a grip, Watson,"" he scolds himself, gripping the sink and staring at his reflection. His cheeks are pink, and heat prickles down his spine and between his legs. ""Good god, get a grip.""

Bending down he fishes around below the sink for his medical kit. Buried below all the gauze, bandages, and ointment is a disposable packet of a special deodorizer for Omegas. In itself, not rare to find in a medical kit. Should a doctor come across a wounded Omega, it would be commonplace for the doctor to use one of these wipes on the major scent glands before administering medical aid.

Pulling a single cloth out of the pack, he put everything away and quickly set about wiping himself down, focusing on his neck, armpits, and groin before flushing the cloth.

Just have to hope that doesn't clog... he thought, watching as the ancient toilet fought to suck the cloth down. But certainly, Sherlock has thrown worse down this old thing,

Sherlock was in the kitchen pouring some viscous liquid into the kettle when John came out, Mrs. Hudson had gone back downstairs. ""Mrs. Hudson asked if she should be expecting a happy announcement soon."" He rolls his eyes. ""I told her to hound you about it. You're better with relationship navigation anyway.""

""Great. Thanks..."" John sighs then stare at the kettle ""what are the chances that'll be safe for tea sometime this century?""

""It's dying anyway. This gives you an excuse to get that new one you've been eyeing at Tesco anyway."" Sherlock shrugs.

""So I guess I'll just go now, shall I?""

John sighs again, though honestly, the fresh air sounded good. He needed out of the flat, away from the confusing scents of Alpha. It was too early to retire to his bedroom, where he could throw a window open and air out the room. The last time He'd tried opening the windows in the sitting room (then he'd simply wanted to let in the fresh spring air) Sherlock had muttered something about dust, and promptly shut them again.

""Need anything? Might as well get a few things while I'm there, and if I'm bringing a kettle home, I'm getting a cab, rather than walking it.""

""Mm those chocolate biscuits. And tea. And honey, as many kinds as you can manage. Ask the butcher for organs from the bin as well."" Sherlock plugs in the kettle.

""I draw the line at organs,"" John grumbled as he grabbed his coat.

Only, once at the store, across from the butcher, he caved. The man, it seemed, was well aware of Sherlock and his habits and didn't hesitate in giving John a few bits and bobs.

""Pigs heart, random fowl innards, and a cow's eye,"" John announces once home. Sherlock is sitting in his chair, hands steepled under his nose deep in thought. John drops the wax paper bag on Sherlock's lap and takes the rest of the groceries into the kitchen.

He washes his hands, then puts the food away. At last turning to the kettle, he unboxes it, and gives it a good rinse, calling over the sound of the running water.

""This is for tea only, Sherlock. No experiments. Water, and tea. Understand?""

""Yes, yes fine."" Sherlock agrees as he looks through his goodie bag.

""You're welcome,"" John states, a bit dramatically though he isn't exactly sure why it was irking him that Sherlock hadn't thanked him. Or why he'd even caved and given into the Alpha's request in the first place.

He's an Alpha... And your body thinks it's about to have a heat. His brain warned, a part of him knowing that close proximity and coming down off medical-grade suppressants would be wreaking havoc with his hormones. I haven't had a proper heat in... Oh god, I can't even remember. Of course, my body is honing in on the first available Alpha it senses.

Sherlock takes the organs to the table and starts dissecting them.

""Takeaway?"" John asks, not even bothering to fight Sherlock for use of the kitchen. Not when he looks so much like a child on Christmas morning.

""I ordered Indian while you were out. Don't worry, I make sure to ask for extra naan."" Sherlock hums as he slices the heart open.

""Uh, thanks.""

""Is that what girlfriends do? Feed you up?""

No, you're looking into this too hard. He likes Indian food, he got it for himself and simply forgot to be selfish and not get me any.

""Right I'll just be.. upstairs, call me when it's here?""

Sherlock doesn't say anything, just continues scrutinizing samples under the microscope.

Risking Sherlock being too absorbed in his work to hear the doorbell, John heads up to his room where he promptly plops down on the bed, breathing in the scent of his bedding, willing the sweet scent of Sherlock to dissipate.

Three more days and I can stab myself with the new suppressant. Just have to make it through a few more days. Maybe Harry is free.

Sherlock gets the food when the delivery comes, pays the delivery man and bounds back to the kitchen. He places the bags on the counter then leans into the hall, calling up the stairs, ""John! Food!"" He waits, listening for John's footsteps, and frowns when there's no answer. ""John?"" He heads up to John's room, ""John, dinner is here."" He says, then notices that the bedroom door is cracked open.

The scents and sounds of London rush past John's ears. Petrol, ozone, pavement, scents from Speedy's... they all assault John's awakening senses. He'd forgotten it was like this, every scent seemed to come with a colour, every scent seeming to linger in his nostrils for hours after logic told him they'd long faded.

He focused on the scents from Speedy's, picking apart the various smoked meats he used in his sandwiches. Until a noise behind him made him pull his head in from the window and spin around.

""Dinner,"" Sherlock says simply as if finding his flatmate hanging out of a second-story window was completely normal.

Purple, his scent is purple. John realized, as the proximity once again brought Sherlock's scent front and center.

""Erm, yeah, be right down.""

Sherlock looks John over for a moment longer before turning and heading back downstairs, the gears in his mind turning.

I should take up smoking, or fake it. That way it appears I have a reason to hang out the window. John chides himself, taking his last breath of fresh air before heading back into the thick of it all.

Thankfully for John, Indian food was not known for subtle scents. Curry half-drowned out the natural scents of the flat, making it tolerable for John to sit across the table from the Alpha.Sherlock has ordered a butter curry, aromas of ginger and coconut rise up and make his mouth water. They divvy out the food, John taking a bit more Naan, and Sherlock extra rice.

""God, I'm starved.""

""I'm sure. You hardly touched your lunch today."" Sherlock hums as he eats, rarely eating himself but always noticing patterns about John. ""I hope it's to your liking."" He says, having picked John's favorites.

""Yeah well, after I learned you'd spilled acid on the table, the thought of eating my sandwich, which I'd prepared on the table, suddenly wasn't very appealing"" Instead of being angry, John laughs. Of all things to be worried about, accidentally ingesting acid was at the very least, interesting.

""I cleaned it up. You're just paranoid."" Sherlock shrugs but he's smiling. ""Mrs. Hudson still won't listen to me about the hip replacement. Will you talk to her? You're a doctor after all.""

""Surgery isn't easy, Sherlock. She'll get it when she's ready, and not a moment before. But, I can suggest a few friends in the field."" John adds, catching the faint smile on Sherlock's face. ""Best she can do is arm herself with knowledge, and make sure it's right for her.""

""It's a good thing we have a resident medical man then,"" Sherlock smirks.

Sherlock is halfway through his plate when his phone starts ringing. He gets up and answers. ""How many? Where?"" He asks, Lestrade calling with a new case.

Knowing that look, and those words, John devours the rest of his meal. When Sherlock was on a case, John was lucky to be given five minutes for a meal, and by how many he assumed there were multiple bodies, which meant Sherlock would want to be there five minutes ago.

""Excellent. We're on the way."" Sherlock hangs up and grabs his coat. ""John, case.""

""Sherlock, curry,"" John says, dipping the naan into the buttery sauce. ""You can wait five minutes for me to finish my meal.""

""Six bodies, John. And an Omega going into heat. Bring your kit."" Sherlock heads downstairs to get them a cab.

""Bloody hell...."" John mutters, wondering just how badly the cabbie would hate him if he brought the curry with him.

Instead, he hastily throws the covers back on the takeaway containers, pops everything into the fridge, hoping there wouldn't be any cross-contamination with Sherlock's organs, and dashes upstairs for his kit.

He exits the flat just in time to see Sherlock vanish into the back of a cab, and hurries forward to join him. The driver is Alpha, which is not uncommon. But between the two of them, in such close quarters, John begins to wonder if there won't be two Omega's going into heat at the crime scene.

John looks over in surprise when Sherlock unrolls the cab window once they start to move through the city. Once at the crime scene, Sherlock tosses the fare at the cabbie and gets out, heading right into the middle of the crime scene with quick strides. He holds up the police tape for John as he takes in the scene.

A small female omega was trembling with a blanket on and officers talking to her. Men and women, Alphas and betas, though Sherlock notices with annoyance that the team tonight is mostly Alphas.

""All unbound Alphas off this scene immediately!"" Sherlock snarls, grabbing Alphas one by one and dragging them off himself when they don't comply. ""John, tend to the woman. Please."" He says, seeing her covered in blood, though it doesn't appear to be her own blood.

John stands still, shocked at seeing Sherlock's full Alpha side unleashed. It rooted him in his spot until Sherlock gave him an order. He's amazed at how many Alphas simply listened to him, only a few lingered long enough for Sherlock to tear them away from the poor girl.

Why? Why does Sherlock want to be alone with her?

John, tend to the woman.

""Uh, yeah... yeah.""

Tightening the grip on his kit he hurries forward, getting as close to the Omega as he could, while still respecting her privacy. Glancing over his shoulder he sees Sherlock dragging the last officer away from the woman, and knows they're mostly out of earshot.

""Hi, I'm Doctor Watson... I'm, well, not a beta, or Alpha..."" He offers softly, watching as she looks up and tries to piece together his confession. It takes her a second, but the realization washes some of the fear from her features. John holds up a single finger to his lips, begging her to keep his secret, then crouches low.

""Are you hurt?"" He asks, still keeping his distance.

She shakes her head, confirming his initial suspicion. ""Did you fall?"" He asked, wondering if she'd been pushed into a puddle of blood. She nods once, but then amends it, shaking her head. Confused, possibly concussed.

""Can I come a bit closer?"" John asks, giving her a friendly smile. She hesitates for a moment before nodding again.

Sherlock makes sure Lestrade kicks the Alphas out before going back to the scene. He makes sure to keep his distance, not wanting to scare the poor woman anymore. He grabs a scent blocker out of one of the police kits. He rips open the package and slaps the patch on his neck. He gives it a few minutes to work before going to have a look at the scene. Six dead alphas, all executed.

Professional.

Sherlock goes back to John and the woman. ""Can you tell us what happened?"" He asks softly, making himself look as small and non-threatening as possible.

""You're fine, this close?"" John asks without looking at Sherlock.

Sherlock shoots him a look that says ""don't be stupid"" then promptly ignores him in favor of listening to the young Omega speak. Her words are broken and don't make much sense so they both wait politely until a team of paramedics arrives, then John pulls Sherlock aside.

""Are you bound? Is there an Omega in your life I need to know about? Because if not, getting that close to her could have been incredibly dangerous! Last thing I need to see is my friend on top of some Omega who's already gone through hell.""

""No I'm not bound. And I have a very good idea of what she's gone through. My body is a transport for my mind. It doesn't rule over me. I rule over it. She needed to feel safe and protected. You did that. You cleaned her up. I protected her from the other Alphas. She gave information that is vital that wouldn't have been without that secure feeling. Besides this bloody patch worked."" Sherlock rips the patch off his neck, a small rash on his neck from where it was.

""I don't care if she was an Omega or beta or Alpha. She was a victim and I will not let her be victimized further or let a murderer go free. I don't care about secondary biology other than if it's a motive for a case or not. Beyond that, it's all background noise.""

""Well, that was still dumb."" John hisses, unable to let go of his anger. He'd been warned that his body would attempt a heat between switching brands of suppressants, but he hadn't realized just how emotional it was making him. He kept just thinking That could be me, ready to go into heat, scared, trapped with an Alpha.

""Next time, warn me you have the bloody patch on, couldn't see it under your collar and scarf.""

John bites his lip then realizes he's still gripping Sherlock's elbow. He drops it, and steps back then motions to the bodies as if willing Sherlock to be anywhere but by his side where his scent and act of protectiveness were making his body beg him to skip the next dose.

""I apologize.."" Sherlock frowns, not liking seeing John so affected. ""You should go home and finish eating. I'm going to go to Bart's and handle the bodies with Molly. I'll probably be gone all night.""

John opens his mouth, about to cus Sherlock out for suggesting John go home. But his gut wrenches, and it has nothing to do with the carnage surrounding them.

Fuck

He begins to think. The flat is too far away to walk to, and being trapped in a taxi with an unknown Alpha wasn't ideal right now.

""I'll... come with you to Bart's, then make my way home from there,"" he says, hoping Sherlock wouldn't object.

Sherlock looks John over but doesn't say anything, only nodding and leading John to the body transport van.

They sit in silence. Sherlock thinking about whatever it was Sherlock Holmes thought about. While John considered dead bodies to be a step up from unknown Alphas who had the power to drive him anywhere, against his will or not.

He felt better, away from the chaos and blood. As his blood pressure went down, so did the symptoms he'd long since forgotten. By the time they made it back to the heart of the city, he almost felt normal, aside from his heightened sense of smell, and decided to at least stop and say hello to Molly.

Sherlock keeps an eye on John, wondering why he's smelling different. Perhaps it was his anger or the worry over the Omega. Could even be the dead Alphas affecting him. He follows John inside Bart's as the bodies are taken to the morgue for processing. ""We should get a treat for Molly from the cafe so she'll let us stay for the autopsies.""

""I'll go... cake? Cupcake?"" John asks, remembering there was a bakery just down the street. Sugar would help him, or at the very least it would satiate his emotions if only a little.

""Good. She likes the red velvet."" Sherlock nods. ""Get yourself something as well. We may be here for a while."" He pulls out a wad of bills from his pocket and hands them over to John before going down to the morgue.

""We?"" John asks himself. ""Not trying to get rid of me now.. why?""

He ends up buying three red velvet cupcakes, and a dozen chocolate-covered strawberries, knowing that even Sherlock wouldn't be able to resist at least one of the sugary fruits. He tucks the box under his arm and heads back into the hospital, feet carrying him through once familiar halls until he's in the morgue. Where the grandeur of the sweets is slightly lost among the stainless steel slabs, and the bodies laid out on them.

He places the parcel down on a table as far away from the bodies as he can, and leans against the wall, waiting for Sherlock and Molly to notice he'd arrived. However, the two were in a deep discussion, carried out in hushed tones, and so far neither seemed to know another living soul was around.

""Their scent glands are gone, Sherlock."" Molly mumbles.

""I can see that. Was it professional or sloppy?"" Sherlock asks as he looks with her.

""Professional..."" John sighs, having gotten near enough to hear.

""I've seen something like this before, and it isn't pretty.""

He pinches the bridge of his nose, sucking in a deep breath to keep his emotions stable. He didn't need another spike of his biology crippling him just because he got worked up.

""In Afghanistan, some insurgents had the brilliant idea that doubling their scent glands would double their strength. Think... when a barbarian goes into its berserk state in a video game or movie. We put an end to it before they had a chance to experiment, but they can't have been the only ones to have that idea.""

""Of all the superstitious pseudoscience."" Sherlock shakes his head.

""Are you alright, John? You look a bit flush."" Molly says quietly.

""Mm? Oh yeah, fine."" John waves Molly off, not even bothering to think of an excuse. ""Going to be here a while? If so, I might head home. Maybe have the flat to myself a bit, watch crap telly without Sherlock deducing it on me.""

""If you remember anything else from what you've seen of this before, text me,"" Sherlock says, pulling on gloves before touching the bodies.

 

""Oh cupcakes."" Molly smiles and goes to the box.

""I'll reach out to a friend, he dealt with most of it. If there's anything we're allowed to share I'll let you know."" John says, smiling at Molly, and remembering his cupcake before heading out.

""Maybe a bubble bath, but I'd have to scrub the tub first. That sounds nice... and some wine? And of course, this cupcake.""

""A nice relaxing evening."" Molly smiles and picks up her cupcake, taking a bite while Sherlock scoures the bodies.

Feeling a bit guilty for leaving Sherlock, John reminds himself that all he'd do, should he stay, was sit and wait. Per policy, he wouldn't be allowed to help, just like Sherlock technically wasn't allowed to help.

By chance or cosmic design, he flags down London's only Beta cab driver and makes it hope without any more spikes.

""I can feel you staring, Molly,"" Sherlock says as he takes samples from under the fingernails.

""Nothing just..."" she titters, ""he brought you chocolate. You can't tell me you didn't notice how flushed he was. If ever there was a time to bond, well, it would be soon. Sherlock. He'll be needing it. And, well, you tolerate him, as much as you do anyone else. More so even.""

Sherlock frowns and glares at Molly. ""What are you talking about?""

""Wine... bubble bath, crap telly. He's nesting. Honestly, for a genius, you're not always very bright. What else does he need to do, hang a neon sign over his head saying I'm going into heat soon, and would like to go home and be comforted by my Alpha because that's silly? Sherlock, very silly, they don't make those signs."" Molly says, shooting her friend a scathing look over one of the dead Alphas.

""Really, you Alphas act like you're the ones in charge when really, we hold all the power because you lot are too dumb to understand.""

Sherlock just blinks. ""I.."" he looks at the bodies. ""Call me when the preliminary results come in."" He whips off the gloves and grabs his coat, heading out the door.

""Yeah, no... I'll text. Don't need you answering the phone during that..."" Molly quips.

John's heat makes a surprise appearance...

Hey, Tindo here! Accident is asleep ;) Maybe some of you lovely people can surprise them with a comment or two for when they wake up?


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Alone in the flat, John breathes in a sigh of relief, though the feeling of relief doesn't last long.

Surrounded by the scents of home and Sherlock, his stomach twists and he can feel a once familiar dampness between his cheeks.

""Fuck."" he hissed, pulling his mobile out of his pocket he dials his contact on the local army base.

He paces for the ten minutes it takes to be connected, then growls into the phone. ""You miss calculated. It's starting, and I need something now not in three days. Fix this, I've had enough unfulfilled heats to last a lifetime, you were supposed to ensure I'd pass as a beta.""

His contact mutters something, and papers are shuffled about, then he's being offered a safe house for the duration, rather than the suppressants he needs now, not in three days. But he knows it's already too late, he's already past the point where medical intervention could help.

He's about to accept the safe house when the floorboards in the hall creak. He turns around and sees Sherlock standing wide-eyed in the doorway.

""There's always something.."" Sherlock says softly, looking John over. He makes sure to stand outside the door to the flat. ""Text me what you need and I'll make sure it's made available to you. I'll stay down in 221C and make sure no one comes in the flat to get you."" He gives John one last look before turning to go.

John ignores the man on the other end of the phone call and stares at Sherlock like a rabbit caught in the headlights for a moment before snapping back to attention

""Don't... go. I just want to take a bubble bath, drink some wine, eat my cupcakes and maybe have my hair stroked for once"" he blurts out before Sherlock can leave. ""Plus,"" he adds quietly, ""we're supposed to be pretending to be a couple, you staying downstairs isn't going to help that. One word and my CO can have me in a safe house for the duration. You can tell people my sister needed me, then we'll get this squared away... So it won't happen again. Unless... You don't want me back.""

The man on the other end of the line sighs impatiently, but John snaps at him, telling him he can wait a few goddamned seconds. He looks over at Sherlock, trying to judge if he'll still have a home in a few days.

""John, this is your home. You should feel safe and welcome here. Whatever you want or need all you have to do is ask and I'll make sure it happens."" Sherlock nods. ""You are indispensable to the Work and to me. You are free to leave any time you want but I will never force you out."" He says softly. He feels awkward and nervous. He doesn't want to upset John or cross any lines.

""I can go start the bath if you'd like?"" Sherlock offers, trying to show John that he'll do anything he can to help him.

John nods once at Sherlock, a small thankful smile playing on his lips. Thinking fast he addresses the man on the other end of the phone call. Ignoring his impatient growl.

""I'm staying home where a friend can protect me. However, you will drop off a vial of heat reducer, which you will hand to anyone who answers the door."" John hangs up, not giving the man time to argue or come up with a less pleasant option for him.

He hears water coming from the bathroom and snaps back to attention. Dashing up the stairs he grabs his most comfortable pair of pyjamas then heads back downstairs where true enough Sherlock is bent over the tub. John lingers in the doorframe, cupcake in one hand, pyjamas in the other.

""This wasn't supposed to happen. I'm in between brands... I think being so close to that omega set me off. Seeing her stress... Sorry... I'm sure you weren't looking for an Omega to flatshare with,"" he mumbles, trying to breach the awkwardness that had come between them.

 

""You don't have to explain anything to me, John. Technically I wasn't looking to flatshare with anyone but Mrs. Hudson needs someone to look out for her and this was her stipulation. If anything, being here helps both her and I a tremendous amount."" Sherlock shrugs as he adds fancy bath salts to the water as well as bubble bath.

""I.."" Sherlock stands and looks at John. ""Living with an Alpha, especially one as difficult to live with as myself, must be hard for you. I want to apologize if I ever made you afraid or fearful as such was never my intention.""

""Yeah..."" John starts to say, but stops and tilts his head. ""You... never made me feel afraid. Half the time, I think you forget you're an Alpha.""

""Gender itself is a construct and secondary gender is like a biological hostage situation. I try to ignore it as much as possible."" Sherlock huffs a small laugh. ""Check the temperature of the bath and I'll go open the wine? Red or white?""

""Biological hostage situation..."" John scoffs, stepping into the room and brushing past Sherlock to dip his finger into the water. ""Never before has a more apt phrase been uttered. I've spent my whole life trying to avoid my heats. Mm waters nice, and.. red? please?""

Without thinking about social expectations, or what would be considered proper, John strips and slips into the water while Sherlock is off getting the wine. He doesn't care when Sherlock enters the room and finds him mostly buried under a layer of bubbles, all he cares about is the relief the warm water has to offer.

Sherlock nods and goes to the kitchen, opening a fresh bottle and pouring some for John. ""Here."" He passes the wine to John. ""Is there anything else I can do or get you? Or I could leave you alone?"" He asks, never having had to take care of someone in heat before.

""Someone, probably in full military kit, carrying a metal ammo box, will be bringing over a vial of reducer for me. It should make it so at the most, I'm itchy and irritable over the next few days. If possible... just no smelly experiments until this is over?""

John wrinkles his nose at the thought of the reducer but doesn't voice his concerns about the medicine. It isn't ideal, but it's better than being in the throes of sexual desire for the next 78 hours.

""From an outsider's perspective, it'll appear we've swapped roles for a time. Me being the grumpy arsehole in the middle of an epic temper tantrum, while you play the role of 'its time to eat, John, you should bathe, John. John, why don't you change your clothes, you've been in the same pants for two days.' ""

Sherlock chuckles softly and nods. ""I suppose I can play nanny for a few days."" He teases. ""What does it feel like? To be in heat?""

John sits up a bit and reaches for the wine, then changes his mind and grabs the cupcake instead.

""It's a bit like,"" he says around a bite, sending crumbs into the water. ""Watching a really bad porno, where you just can't look away no matter how badly you want to. Like feeling every cell in your body turn to lava for days on end unless sexual gratification is met. It's always been bad for me, I was told they'd get easier once I was an adult... but.."" He shrugs and meets Sherlock's gaze, unaware of just how weird it was to be having this conversation naked, in a tub, with an Alpha looming over him. ""Too many years suppressing it, I guess, kind of ruined it for myself.""

""That doesn't sound pleasant at all."" Sherlock leans against the sink. ""Does spending a heat with a partner help?""

""Don't know. Never have."" John says around another mouthful of confectionary heaven. ""Threat of an unwanted bond, when my body literally can't say no. Doesn't sound pleasant to me. I'm more than my biology, more than a man capable of bearing children. I refuse to let some sod bond me and stick me at home to raise his.. or her... pups.""

Cupcake gone, John sinks back down into the water, letting the wine sit for another moment.

""I should warn you, me living here... guess it could put you in trouble. I'm registered as an Omega, of course. But the military made a few exceptions and had all that buried. Still, you being an Alpha... you'd have to sign ownership of me.""

Sherlock scowls. ""I don't want ownership of you. If anything you're the more reliable and more stable one in this flat. You should have ownership over me if anyone was to own anyone."" He rolls his eyes and sits on the floor, his back leaning against the tub.

""You are your own person. A highly skilled doctor and a veteran. You shouldn't have to struggle for personhood like this. It's archaic and deplorable. The only thing that comes out of it is abuse and unhealthy relationships. My mother knocked my father up. They were dating sure but they hadn't even discussed marriage. Then Mycroft was born so of course, they had to do the right thing and bond."" He makes a gagging noise.

Sherlock sighs and leans his head back against the edge of the tub. ""I'll do whatever I can to make things easier for you but I will not do anything legally binding without your full knowledge and consent."" He turns his head to look at John.

""Pass me a flannel?"" John asks after a long stretch of silence.

Part of him knows this should be weird, having Sherlock so close. However, he can't deny that Sherlock's company, in itself, is comforting.

""Dad's an omega then..."" he muses, accepting the flannel and dipping it into the water before wringing it out and placing it over his face. Humid warmth washes over him and he lets out a happy sigh.

""Not many of us out there, at least not out in the open. It's harder nowadays when the world has a picture-perfect idea of what masculinity should look like, and bearing children isn't part of that picture.""

""My father came from a poor family. They were basically destitute but he was an omega so he could have his pick of whatever suitor he wanted. My mother is from a wealthy family and she's a mathematician. Quite brilliant in fact, her work has changed quite a few fields."" Sherlock relaxes, the humidity of the bathroom and John's scent calming.

""Father was a photographer. He took some of the most breathtaking photos I've ever seen. Then after having Mycroft he became allergic to the chemicals used in the developing process. I don't think he ever really forgave mother for getting him pregnant. Especially after he wouldn't develop his own work anymore."" He frowns.

""Mm biological changes after a male Omega's pregnancy are not uncommon. Your whole body changes, the testosterone you naturally make all but vanishes during pregnancy. I can't imagine it was easy.""

The flannel has gone cold, so John drags it off of his face and reaches for the wine.

""My mum was the Omega, so it was a bit easier on her. Harry lucked out, got the Alpha trait while I'm stuck like this every few months. It was half the reason I joined the military. The suppressants they have are far superior to anything you can get at the local chemist. They rendered me identical to a beta male. Only clues would have been my own physical appearance, not that I let anyone see.""

Warm and comfortable, John lets out a small sigh. The tightness in his body is no longer clawing at his every nerve. ""The case then? Do you know who did it?""

""I have an idea but I need more data first. The Alphas had surrounded that woman because they smelled her heat. Someone took them out. The interesting part is the scent gland removal."" Sherlock hums, eyes closed.

""Mm, well if anyone can figure this out, you can.""

John sipped his wine and was silent for a long moment. That could have been him surrounded by Alphas, it had been once. He knew the fear she must have been feeling.

""Glad she's safe.""

""As am, I."" Sherlock hums. He could tell that John's scent was becoming more pronounced but it didn't bother him in the way most Alphas seem to be bothered. If anything it allowed him to categorize all of John's smells. He wanted to know everything about John.

""I'm going to... Erm, finish up here."" John said after a moment. ""Someone should be by soon. I should be able to manage the injection on my own, but I'd rather not open the door myself. Would you mind answering?"" Finding himself wanting to stare at the back of Sherlock's neck, he warms the flannel and places it back over his eyes.

""Of course."" Sherlock nods and gets up, his long limbs stretching him off the floor. ""Is there anything else I can order you that you may need? Certain food? Entertainment? Toys?""

John laughs out loud at that. Simply thinking about Sherlock walking into an adult shop and buying the largest Alpha cock dildo the store has to offer almost makes this whole ordeal worth it.

""No. If the reducer will take away the worst of those urges. Thank God. I might be a bit more munchy, but mainly out of boredom than anything. Snacks could be good. But don't go out of your way.""

Sherlock tips his head as if confused. ""What was so funny?""

""You buying me a dildo.""

John begins to laugh again, then with a wave of his hand says, ""what are friends for, if they can't help you shove a synthetic cock up your own arse.""

""I've bought a dildo before, John. It's not a very complicated process."" Sherlock rocks back and forth from his heels to the balls of his feet. ""And if it could help you I wouldn't think twice about it.""

""Yeah, but buying one for yourself is one thing. It's not exactly the most common gift."" John peels back the flannel and grins up at Sherlock. The doorbell rings before either of them get a chance to say anything else and Sherlock excuses himself to answer the door.

""Well, when I woke up this morning I didn't think I'd be soaking in a bubble bath with an Alpha sitting beside me."" John mutters to himself as he clambers out of the tub and towels off.

Sherlock answers the door seeing a man standing there just as John had described. ""The medication?"" He holds his hand out.

John is dressed in his cotton pyjamas and is walking out of the bathroom by the time Sherlock comes back upstairs. He rolls his eyes at the armoured box containing the single vial and motions towards the table. Sherlock sets it down and watches as he opens the box.

""Will it be an issue, watching me? Triggers an all that,"" he asks, pulling out a hyperdynamic needle. He rips the packaging off of it and wastes no time in piercing the cap on the vial.

Sherlock shakes his head. ""Haven't had cravings in a while."" He rips open the alcohol wipe packet and holds it out to John.

""Right, just making sure.""

Thanks to the warmth from the tub he finds a vein easily. After cleaning the skin with the wipe he injects the yellowish liquid into his system then purses his lips.

""Do me a favour, watch me for the next twenty minutes. I haven't had this yet, so don't know if I'm allergic. Keep an eye out for cognitive slips, hives, or shortness of breath."" Slipping the needle out of his body he paces the cap over the sharp end and tossed into the bin.

""I'll make tea,"" Sherlock says and goes to the kettle. Once he has it filled and turned on he pulls out his phone, fingers flying over the keyboard.

John half wants to ask if Molly has texted yet. The case would distract him from the ache of desire and longing to be pressed up against an Alpha, strong arms holding him close while he buries his nose into dark curls.

Fuck. Not any Alpha. He starts, realizing that the faceless alpha in his fantasy wasn't as faceless as it had once been. Now Sherlock's elegant curves replaced the once blocky shape, pale skin and sharp eyes replaced the once fuzzy face.

""I'm... Going to curl up on the sofa."" John mutters, shuffling past the Alpha he now shared a flat with. ""One sugar, please. I crave sweet things when I'm like this.""

""Mm."" Sherlock hums and nods, not looking up from his phone. When the tea is ready he makes it and brings John his mug as well as a package of biscuits he knows John secretly likes when he's not feeling well.

""No signs of allergic reaction yet, the worst would have kicked in by now."" John says, watching Sherlock's fingers fly across the front of his phone. ""case stuff? Do you need to leave?""

""Mm? No. Placing an order."" Sherlock says as he looks at the list of items. ""Do you prefer milk or dark chocolate?""

""What?"" John lifts his head and glances over at Sherlock in puzzlement.

""Dark or milk chocolate. I've seen you enjoy both. I'll get both."" Sherlock hums, sipping his tea as he adds more things to the order.

""You're being nice to me..."" John says when half his tea is gone. He can't recall the last time Sherlock was voluntarily nice to anyone. Even when buttering up a client, the act slipped the instant it was no longer needed. Yet, something told John this wasn't an act. ""Why?""

Sherlock squirms a bit, looking uncomfortable. ""I want you to stay here at Baker Street. Most people can't stand being around me longer than absolutely necessary and yet you live here by your own volition. You're indispensable to the Work and to me. And I'd rather have you comfortable and safe with me than out there. Alphas are disgusting horrendous creatures. If I could be anything else I would."" He looks at John.

John sighs and props his back up against the arm of the sofa, stretching his feet out over the cushions.

""I was afraid you'd ask me to leave, if you found out. I've been careful, soaps, and scent neutralizer clothes. I think seeing that Omega in stress set me over the edge. I was worried that if I accepted their offer of a safe house, I'd come back to find you gone, or my things on the pavement.""

""Never, John. This is your home just as much as mine."" Sherlock promises.

""Pass me the blanket from my chair?"" John asks, curling up on his side with his back against the cushions.

The contents of the vial were making him drowsy.

""Just.. going to nap a bit.""

Sherlock gets the blanket and lays it out over John. ""I'll be here if you need anything.""

""Ta,"" John mumbles moments before slipping off to sleep.

Dreams during a heat were typically far more vivid than normal dreams. John imagined they were meant to make the omega wake up already gagging for it. But instead of the faceless Alphas hovering around him as per normal, he dreamt of Sherlock sitting by his head, running those long fingers through his sandy hair.

Sherlock watches John sleep for a bit before sitting on the edge of the couch, gently threading his fingers through John's hair. John had mentioned that this would help so he thought he'd try it. He places the order that should arrive by the time John woke up.

John is a whore for bubble baths, what can I say?

Sherlock finds some ways to help John with his heat..

The sitting room is empty when John wakes, but a soft rustling of bags from the kitchen tells John he's not alone.

Focusing on his body he's pleased to find that, while still sensitive and desperately longing for a good solid hug, his heat hasn't progressed any further.

He yawns and stretches, finding a pillow had been placed under his head while he slept.

""Oh good, you're awake. Put this together."" Sherlock brings John a box with a collapsible projector screen inside.

""Uhhh..."" John mutters, running a hand through his strangely disheveled hair.

Sherlock doesn't give him time to think about it. He simply thrusts the object against his chest, leaving it to John to make sure it doesn't clatter to the floor.

He sits at the table, staring at the mess while trying to figure out how to put the box together.

""Did you buy out Gregg's?

""Hardly, John. They just have a larger selection on the website."" Sherlock hums as he dumps out bags of snacks. He puts them away where they go and then starts working on the larger bags. He puts away the bathroom supplies, bath bombs and bubble bath.

""No one has ever done this for me before,"" John says softly, watching as Sherlock moves about.

""I... Thanks...""

Sherlock nods stiffly. ""I... I was sent to an alpha and beta boys boarding school when I was a child. I presented late which they teased me mercilessly for. One day another boy who they thought was a beta went into heat. He just so happened to be assigned my partner for a project. We were in the library and he was sweating and trembling. Then they came.. I held them off for as long as I could until the professors could arrive. I was sent to the hospital with a concussion and multiple fractures but they didn't lay one finger on him.""

""Uh.. wow."" John says, thinking back to his first heat and how terrifying it had been.

""He was lucky to have someone watching out for him. Not everyone is so lucky. And in a mixed school, god...""

""I was suspended for fighting. The others were let off with a warning because they were following their instincts. I was a freak who didn't want to rape my helpless classmate."" Sherlock shakes his head.

""Yeah well, it's not legally classified as rape, now is it..."" John says bitterly, ""It's our own damn fault for being out in public like that. Here... I think this is done?"" He holds up the box for Sherlock's inspection.

""But that's what it is. I don't care what name it has."" Sherlock takes the box and pulls the handle and the projector screen rolls perfectly. ""Excellent."" He takes it out to the living room and stands it up, unrolling the screen. He goes back to the table and unboxes a mini projector.

""Did you get popcorn?"" John asks, trying not to sound too hopeful as the pieces began to fit together. It was a pain moving their tiny tv so they could both sit comfortably on the sofa.

Clearly, Sherlock had some sort of movie night planned, though his idea of entertainment was usually a documentary on ash, which to him was something along the lines of a comedy.

""Obviously, John. What kind of heathen do you take me for?"" Sherlock scoffs as he pulls out an air popcorn popper from another bag. ""There's also an assortment of flavorings from sweet to savory to once that I find strange to put on popcorn."" He hands John the box of flavorings before taking the popper out of the box.

""Mmmm sweet for me""

John isn't quite sure where to place the box, so he placed it on the coffee table, then on a whim climbs the stairs to his room and comes back with half his bedding in tow.

""Should we warn Mrs. Hudson? Though the more I think about it the more I imagine she'd be thrilled to learn I'm an Omega.."" John says, claiming half the sofa as his with his various pillows and blankets then climbing into his makeshift nest.

""I told her that you weren't feeling well and not to come up so she doesn't catch anything. It is your information to give if you wish to do so."" Sherlock plugs in the projector and hands John a new weighted blanket while it turns on.

""Ta,"" John says to both Sherlock's words and the blanket. He replaced one of his thinner blankets with the new one, sighing as the weight settles around him

""Oh, this is heaven.""

""Good."" Sherlock smiles, he had done research on how to help an omega through their heat without sex. ""There is also a new heating pad should you need it. The last one caught fire."" He hums, not admitting he was the reason it had gone up.

""Very flammable, those heating pads,"" John grins, curling up into a tight little ball. ""So which documentary are we watching today?""

""No documentary today. I was thinking something more to your liking."" Sherlock hooks up the Bluetooth from his laptop to the projector. On the screen appears the title page of a Bond movie.

""Oh!""

With the popcorn ready they each fix themselves a bowl, John option for a sweeter flavour while Sherlock goes for something a bit more normal.

""Thanks,"" he says again as the opening song begins to play.

""Not a problem."" Sherlock hums as he munches on a handful of popcorn.

John makes it through half the movie before his eyes begin to get heavy from a mixture of the medicine, comfort, and a full stomach.

Propped up on a stack of pillows he begins to doze off waking every few minutes, or when the action gets too loud.

Eventually, the volume doesn't matter. Without thinking about *who* was beside him. He gave in to the basic desire of human connection. Pushing all but one of his pillows aside he plants the final pillow square on Sherlock's lap then curls up with the back of his head pressed against Sherlock's stomach.

Sherlock stills, letting John do as he pleases. He gently pets John's hair and lowers the volume of the movie.

The credits have long since ended, the screen black when John finally wakes up.

It takes him a moment to remember that the reason the surface below his head is warm is because it is Sherlock's lap, not his bed.

He sits up and finds Sherlock silently watching him.

Instead of mentioning the obvious, his falling asleep on an Alpha, he sleepily asks, ""Anything from Molly?""

""The alphas samples came back and they were all dosed with a slow-acting paralytic."" Sherlock hums. ""I'm starting to think they may have been lured to that alley.""

""Lured that close to an Omega in heat..."" John hisses, ""was she a plant... Or?""

""I don't think she was involved with whatever scheme was going on. She may have just been a convenient coincidence. Her terror and fear were genuine.""

""Check my phone, see if my contact got back to me on his findings in Afghanistan, if you haven't already,"" John says around a yawn. 'I need the loo.""

Sherlock nods and gets John's phone, looking for messages.

John finds Sherlock engrossed in what he assumed to be the email and curled back up on the sofa.

""Let me guess it's a photocopy of a report and almost all the words are redacted.""

Sherlock frowns and nods. ""Redactions never make sense to me. Knowledge is knowledge. It's just a hindrance to the truth."" He hands John back his phone before getting his laptop. He logs into the MET server using Lestrade's login so he can search for similar cases of scent glands being removed.

""Maybe your brother can get the original copy?"" John offers around another yawn.

""Think I'll turn in. Erm. Thanks for the movie night, and the snacks. And the bath, ""

It takes him a moment but he gathers up his bedding and heads for the stairs.

""Oh, I read that having familiar scents helps. Would you like some of my clothing?"" Sherlock asks, looking up from his laptop.

""Ummm....""

John stops at the door and tenses for a fraction of a second. Sleeping with Sherlock's clothing hadn't been even in the far reached of the back of his mind. But now presented with the offer, he found he didn't want to refuse.

""Would you mind?"" He said carefully.

""Of course not."" Sherlock nods as he stands and starts to unbutton his shirt.

""Oh. I thought you'd get a new sh... That works too."" John stammers watching as each undone button revealed a bit more of Sherlock's skin.

He found himself contemplating what it would be like to nuzzle along Sherlock's chest when he felt the familiar clench in his stomach.

Sherlock passes John the shirt, he has some scarring from failed experiments and fights, silvery scars over his pale skin.

""That must have required stitches..."" Shuffling the shirt, and the pile of bedding into one arm John reaches out and runs a finger along a scar just across the left of Sherlock's chest.

""Mm pocket life."" Sherlock nods, relaxing under John's touch.

""Yours or... Oh.. the Omega in the library,"" John guesses while wondering how it's possible that such a simple point of contact could feel as good as it felt to be touching Sherlock.

""That's right,"" Sherlock says softly, gently taking a step closer. He lists what different scars are from. He pushes his hair to the side, a scar on his scalp. ""Had to have a hole drilled to ease pressure on my brain.""

The close proximity is making John's head spin. Both physically and mentally.

""I had a suspicion that you are human..."" He murmurs, ""but this is proof. What's this one from?"" John traces the small scar at the corner of Sherlock's lips, a feature that instead of hindering Sherlock looks added.

""Another junky head-butted me when his stash went missing. He thought I stole it but he'd used it up."" Sherlock mumbles against John's fingers.

John lets his finger drop, worried that if he didn't his stomach would clench with desire again.

""I've just got the one really, and an appendix scar. I mean a few odds and ends here and there, but nothing as heroic as some of yours.""

""Most of them are stupid accidents."" Sherlock shrugs.

""They usually are... Right. well... "" John nods towards the stairs then catches a pillow before it slips to the floor ""goodnight, Sherlock.""

""Goodnight, John."" Sherlock nods and goes back to his laptop.

Up in his room, John hastily makes his bed then plops down, face first, nose buried into the soft fabric of Sherlock's shirt.

""It's just your bloody heat talking. Get a grip. He doesn't like you, not like that.""

Sherlock spends the night working on the case.


John wakes up the next morning with Sherlock's shirt held closely to the side of his face. He's pleased to find his heat hadn't progressed over the night, but annoyed to find he was still on the verge of wanting a wank followed by a bottle of wine, then another wank. He slides his hand down to the waistband of his pyjamas but stops short of touching himself. It doesn't feel right, masturbating with Sherlock's scent cloying at his nostrils. Surley there was a line that shouldn't be crossed about fantasising over your flatmate, even if he were an Alpha. 



Sherlock is downstairs making breakfast, a full spread for John to enjoy. He had done more research on Omega's overnight in-between casework. Through such research, he'd learned that nesting usually came hand in hand with comfort eating.



""John!"" Sherlock calls up. ""Breakfast is almost ready.""



John's hand slides out of his waistband with a snap of elastic. He groans and sits up. Half wanting to remain curled up under his pile of blankets, while the rest of him wanted to find out what Sherlock considers breakfast to be. The growling in his stomach wins, and without changing into fresh pyjamas, he heads downstairs. Leaving Sherlock's shirt spread out on top of his pillow.



Sherlock has all of John's favorites on the table. ""Research says that heats can lead to increased appetite.""



""Mmm, did you sleep, or did you spend up all night researching Omegas?"" John says sleepily, slumping down into a chair and wincing when his extra sensitive rear end hits the hard surface. John tucks in, and despite his grumbling, a smile creeps over his face at the array of food.



""Thanks,"" He says, reaching for a plate and loading it up with greasy breakfast foods.



Sherlock nods and eats a piece of bacon. ""That and the case. Oh here."" He gets a cushion and hands it to John to pad the chair.



""Anything new with the case?"" John asks while stabbing a sausage with his fork. He brings it to his mouth and pops the end in, sucking off some of the juices before taking a bite, and repeating the process with the rest of the sausage until it's gone.



Sherlock is distracted for a second before speaking. ""I found a few similar cases where the scent gland was removed but the paralytic is new. Someone with access to medical-grade chemicals.""



""Might be hard to track down. More people than you know have access to medical-grade chemicals... I mean, even pharmaceutical reps have access, in small quantities. It's amazing what they're allowed to carry on them.""



He snags a pancake, and takes a bite, humming in pleasure to see Sherlock had gone for the sweeter, American version of the breakfast. Sherlock hands him a bottle of syrup, which John slathers onto the meal, then licks his fingers clean.



Sherlock's chest feels warm as he watches John eat the food he prepared. ""John, you may be on to something."" He pulls out his phone.



""Mm? Of course, I am. I'm smarter than I look. Bloody army surgeon, not some GP.. Have you ever tried operating on someone while IEDs are going off around you?"" 



John smiles warmly, the food and Sherlock's apparent interest in his input on the case puffing up his feeling of self-worth. He'd known for quite some time that his 

love language

 was a mixture of words of praise and touch, and in the last 14 hours, he'd had a plethora of both.



""Wouldn't want anyone else performing surgery on me in a war zone."" Sherlock chuckles. ""Your experience and knowledge is very useful.""



""Keep saying that, it's nice."" John jokes, finally setting his fork down after devouring half the food on the table. ""You should eat something.""



Sherlock picks at John's leftovers. ""Quite a few of our cases wouldn't have been solved without your knowledge and social skills.""



""Go on..."" John says, leaning back in the chair and grinning wide. ""Kidding, you don't have to. Are you going to head out today, hit the pavement, and solve the case? I should be alright, as long as you lock the doors behind you.""



John thinks for a moment then asks, ""Well, I 

think 

I'll be alright. I can't smell myself... is it bad?""



Sherlock nods. ""You smell like you're in heat. I'm still waiting on some more information so going out isn't strictly necessary as of yet.""



""Shit, I can go wash up with that soap...""



John stands and stretches. He doesn't feel like he's in heat, a bit flushed, sensitive, and his clothes felt too restricting. But all in all, he felt normal like he'd just spent too long in a sauna and his body was still tingling from the heat. Once he'd worked the kinks out of his shoulders he brought his plate to the sink and headed down the hall, intent on a quick shower and a thorough scrub.



""You don't have to. It doesn't bother me."" Sherlock shrugs. ""It's up to you.""



John shrugs and continues down the hall, where Sherlock's scent was strongest near his bedroom.



""The thought of not wearing clothes is pleasant enough that I find I want a shower. Might test the hot water limits, so if you need hot water, get it now.""



""I got some bath bombs as well if you want another bath,"" Sherlock suggests. ""Anything I can do?""



""I'm alright,"" John assures Sherlock, disappearing into the bathroom. This time he shut the door, but took care not to shut it hard.



While the thought of another lazy bath with good conversation and company was tempting, he wasn't certain his body would allow him to keep it just that, pleasant company.  He breathed a sigh of relief the moment his clothes were off his skin, and stepped into the shower, pulling the curtain in tight so the steam wouldn't leak out.



""First things first... I'm going to have a bloody wank and see if that helps get this out of my system."" He muttered to himself, while stroking his hand down his stomach and cupping himself.



Sherlock cleans up breakfast and puts away the leftovers. He goes back to the living room and looks at the notes he has pinned to the wall.



The shower and wank are wonderful, but neither help alleviate John's level of discomfort. When the hot water starts to run out, he scrubs himself clean, opting for Sherlock's soap rather than his neutralizer, then steps out.



Dressed in just his pyjama bottoms, figuring there was no point in being uncomfortable in front of partial nudity, seeing Sherlock had sat in on his bath, he wanders out of the bathroom and curls back up on the sofa, watching Sherlock work.



""Here."" Sherlock hands John a black nondescript bag as he tacks some new notes to the wall. Inside the bag were a few different sex toys.



""Mmm... Thanks.. I guess?"" John says, blushing a bit when he saw the contents. Placing them on the floor beside the sofa he reaches for the weighted blanket and pulls it over his lower half, dragging it up to his ribs. ""Trying to avoid that, if possible. Sometimes scratching the itch just makes it worse.""



""As long as you're not suffering."" Sherlock shrugs, frowning as he looks at the wall.



""Suffering, no. Annoyed and slightly uncomfortable, yes."" John says, thinking about the Omega cowering in terror the night before. ""Trust me, I have it easy right now compared to her. Her terror will only amplify her heat, unbound as she is... she'll be lucky to.... Sherlock!"" 



John sits up, and reaches for the nearest phone, and begins poking at the keys.



""What if we're looking at this from the wrong angle? What if this was never about the dead Alphas, but about the Omega? She's going to need to be bound this heat or else her heat is going to be intolerable. Favorable, for an Alpha who's been trying to win the favour of an Omega who isn't interested.""



He taps out a quick message to Lestrade, asking who the paramedics were who'd taken her, and where she'd been brought to.



""All that Alpha had to do was orchestrate the right scenario, and make it so he was there when she needed him the most. Taking their scent glands might have been for fun, or just to throw us of the trail.""



""Oh. 

Oh John!

 You're brilliant!"" Sherlock grins. ""A savior complex. Saves her from the Alphas and then disappears so she can receive medical attention. We need to know where she is right now.""



""Sherlock..."" John says after a pregnant pause. He gets up, leaving the comfort of his temporary nest, and places both hands on either of Sherlock's arms.



""Be careful... I mean it. We're not completely defenseless, in our heats. Just like your scent has the ability to drive me nuts, Omegas can control their ability to bring an alpha to their knees. Seduction at its finest.""



He says, not realizing his slip, inserting Sherlock specifically into the scenario, rather than a generic Alpha. ""I could, with a single thought, have you on your knees with lust. Boost my pheromones purposefully to blind you with desire. It's temporary, and only enhances the Alpha's abilities and strengths in the end. But she could be using it to keep him away from her. She might even use it on you if you waltz in as her knight in shining armor. Better to bond with a Savior than the man inflicting so much stress. Might be best to send a beta in, or...""



He chews his lips for a moment, considering if he could trust Sherlock with the information, ""there's a group, a society of people whose goal is to aid omegas. Alphas like you who have no desire to cave to social standards of fuck, breed, then fuck some more. They pair a needy omega up with an Alpha, who will bond with them, then leave forever. I'll send you the details, they might be able to help, though she isn't capable of making a decision like that right now...""



He meets Sherlock's steady gaze, feeling the intensity of it and realizing his thumbs had been brushing small circles over Sherlock's arms.



Sherlock watches John intently, feeling his strong hands on him. ""Do it. Do it, John. Show me what I'd be up against."" He wanted to know how an omega could affect others and he needed to know the extent to which it could affect him.



Sherlock takes half a step closer, his chest pressed to John's as he rests his hands on the omega's hips. ""I need to know that I can resist it. That the Work isn't in danger of biological impulses. Please, John. You must show me.""



""Sherlock,"" John says, instilling a slight growl into his voice, ""I don't think you understand what you're asking me to do. It ramps up your instincts, you have displayed incredible control, but what if this breaks that? I don't want to be the reason you go against everything you've fought for.""



John takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He can feel the warmth of Sherlock's chest against his own bare skin and the fingers wrapped around his waist feel like branding iron.



""Cuff me to a chair then."" Sherlock's warm breath brushes against John's temple. ""I'm used to temptation, John. My entire existence and fraught with desire and temptation and addiction. Give me some credit."" He noses as John's hair lightly.



""No, not a chair, too easily moved. The radiator in the bathroom.""



John says, after a moment of thinking.



Sherlock goes off to get the cuffs, leaving John missing his presence mere centimeters away from him. Gathering himself for what he was about to do he squared his shoulders and met up with Sherlock in the bathroom.



""Not even going to ask why you have these,"" he murmurs, taking the cuffs from Sherlock and attaching one end to the sturdy radiator. ""Wrist, please. And remember, if you pull this will hurt you, not the radiator.""



Sherlock offers his wrist to be cuffed. ""Nicked them off Lestrade when he's annoying. I've been cuffed to a radiator before. I know the drill."" He smirks.



""Git..."" John smiles, despite himself and what he's about to do. ""You're... uh.. going to get hard, sorry.""



Sherlock shrugs. ""It happens occasionally. I ignore it and it goes away soon enough.""



""Hope you're right.... Do me a favor, reach out as far as you can? I need to make sure I'm not in danger of being grabbed.""



Sherlock reaches out as far as he can, pulling on the cuff and showing John the range of his reach. ""That's as far as I can go without gnawing my own hand off.""



With the back of his heels pressed against the side of the tub, John nods and sits on the edge.



""Sorry... in advance."" Casting Sherlock a single apologetic look he closes his eyes and focuses.



It's been years since he's had to do this, and while unpracticed, it's a trick any Omega can call up instantly. It's like taking a triple dose of ecstasy, but instead of being the one feeling the effects, he's the satellite.



He knows his pheromones have changed, growing more potent with the heady promise the scents carry with them. Sherlock's eyes instantly go wide and his nostrils begin to flare.



""Like this, Sherlock, I could say anything in the world. I could be telling you that you have a troll sized booger hanging out of your nostril, and all you'll hear is sex, sex sex.""



He wiggles a bit, the change making his body believe it would finally learn what it's like to be with an Alpha during his heat, something he'd denied himself his whole life.



""Can you talk still? Tell me how you're feeling? It takes a minute for it to kick in. Your body has to absorb my scent, then I can play with you.""



Sherlock breathes deeply, John's scent and pheromones washing over him. He closes his eyes and drops his head as he tries to focus. His cock filling out in his tight trousers. ""It's.. it."" He swallows. ""It's strong.""



""Yeah, sorry, there's no dial. Just on or off. It's mean to help us overwhelm an Alpha. Sometimes used for mutual fun, but mostly to escape tough situations. We can do it even when we don't have a heat, but it just dazes and confuses an assailant.""



Watching Sherlock's eyes, he waits until the pupils start rapidly narrowing then enlarging again.



""Right about now, you'll be feeling the full effect. Which means my words mean nothing to you.""



John shrugged and found himself wondering if Sherlock's mind was still intact if he could still deduce and read him as plain as a page in one of his mystery novels.



A low growl fills the room, making the hairs on his neck stand, and an electric shock rolls through his stomach.



It had been far too long since he'd heard an Alpha turn their attention on him, and here on the cusp of this strange heat, his body craved it.



John stands from the edge of the tub and inches closer, inhaling the Alpha's scent and letting his eyes flutter shut.



Notes of rich leather, honey, and caramel fill his nose and he lets out a low mewling sound.



""You.."" Sherlock shows his breathing. ""You can touch me, John. I won't touch you back."" He licks his lips. ""You're in charge. I'm at your mercy.""



""If I touch you, you won't like what happens next,"" John whispers, his mouth watering at the very thought of burying his nose in the V of Sherlock's groin.



""Your control is astonishing, but mine wouldn't be quite as impressive.""



Closing his eyes he focuses for a moment, then shudders as the warmth is sapped out of him. He's left feeling hollow and worn out, like a pair of ratty jeans that have managed to avoid the garbage bin far past their prime.



Placing the handcuff key on the floor he kicks it towards Sherlock then flees the bathroom, heading to his bedroom, giving both himself and Sherlock space while they sort themselves out.



Sherlock sits on the floor for some time, eyes closed and head down. Eventually, he reaches for the key and lets himself out of the cuff. He goes and stands at the bottom of the stairs. ""John? Are you alright?"" He calls up to John's room.



John has his hands down his pants when Sherlock calls up to him.



It doesn't feel right answering him, while his scent still lingered and fueled his fantasies, but the alternative was Sherlock walking in on him under the guise of checking on him.



Only, it wasn't a ruse, was it? Over the past day, Sherlock had displayed over and over that some part of him cared. Mr. I don't do sentiment had suddenly decided to show his heart. From the junk food to the blanket, to simply being willing to listen.



Sighing, John calls out ""Fine... go save her, Sherlock.""



Sherlock hesitates for a moment before getting his coat. ""If you need anything call me immediately. Mrs. Hudson won't let anyone in and if they try she's armed. I'll be back as soon as I can."" He races down the stairs and out the door.



John finishes his guilty wank, then cleans up, despite knowing Sherlock would be able to smell it the moment he walked back in the flat. In desperate need of fresh air, John drags every stitch of bedding he owns over to the window, throws the window open as wide as it can go, and curls up into a ball on the floor below it.


Sherlock finishes a case and Mycroft is a prick.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Hours later Sherlock comes home. He was sore and there was some dried blood smeared over his face but the woman was safe and the case was solved. ""John? I'm home."" He says as he takes off his coat.

Unable to sleep, due to his body feeling as if it were on fire, every ounce of him screaming for an Alpha, John is awake when Sherlock gets home. The nearby church bell rings two in the morning, and Sherlock's scent (stronger now that he's home) wafts up the stairs. Mixed with it is the vile scent of another Omega in heat and a coppery undertone.

John knows that scent well, it haunts his nightmares. Red blood dripping from men he was trying to save. The mixture of scents has him on his feet before his brain has time to catch up with his actions. He slithers, more than walks, down the stairs, every one of his movements betraying him as an Omega, rather than the soldier he'd become.

He finds Sherlock in the kitchen, turning the kettle on. Sauntering up to Sherlock he takes Sherlock's face in both hands and begins twisting it up towards the light, inspecting him for an injury.

""Yours? Or... hers.."" He growls, wondering how so much blood found its way to the corners of Sherlock's mouth. Anger boils up in him, imagining Sherlock's teeth sinking into the neck of someone. Someone else. Not his neck.

""Clam yourself, John. No one is bonded to me."" Sherlock says softly as he relaxes into John's touch. ""I went to the hospital to see her. While I was there the Alpha that's been stalking her hit me over the head with a bedpan. Fortunately for me, it takes more than that to knock me out. A fight broke out. He tried to strangle me as he slammed my head against the floor so I grabbed him by the hair and pulled him down, ripping his scent gland out of his neck with my teeth.""

John only hears half of what Sherlock said. His mind swimming and heart singing knowing that Sherlock was still unbonded.

""Sit,"" he orders, gathering himself. Placing a hand on Sherlock's shoulder he pushes him into one of the chairs. He hurries into the bathroom to retrieve his medical kit. The cuffs still dangle from the radiator, reminding him of Sherlock leaning against it. The outline of his cock hard and heavy against posh trousers.

Without realizing it, he mentally flips the pheromone switch. Then heads back out to the kitchen where he begins cleaning Sherlock's face with a warm cloth, dabbing antiseptic on the tiny scrapes he finds in Sherlock's pale skin.

""You should get tetanus, and rabies shot, if you aren't up to date. You probably ingested some of his blood, and who knows if he's clean or not.""

""Yes, John."" Sherlock closes his eyes, relaxing. ""I'll have my brother send someone to give me the jabs."" He mumbles, he spreads his legs, and tugs John a bit closer by his hips so John can reach him better. ""He was obsessed with her. He's been leaving her flowers and gifts inside her flats no matter how many times she moves. Apparently, he'd also been orchestrating scenarios where he could save her."" He hums as he rubs John's thighs.

John sighs, his body relaxing as Sherlock's fingers brush over the thin cotton of his pyjamas.
The simple act of providing care calms him, until he forgets his panic over thinking Sherlock had come back bonded. When he's done, and Sherlock's face is no longer stained crimson, he finds he doesn't want to step away. With Sherlock sitting, he's taller than the Alpha. Looking down, he stares at Sherlock's lips, licking his own lips, wondering what it would be like to simply lean forward and taste his mouth.

Sherlock looks up at him, reading his face. ""Let me have a shower and we can cuddle on the couch if you would like."" He says softly, seeing the stress and worry on John's face and how his presence eases that.

""Sofa is too small..."" John says, growling when Sherlock eases him back so he can stand. ""Your bed is bigger.""

Without allowing himself time to think, he heads down the hall, this time nudging the door at the very end of the hall open, entering the Alpha's domain. Sherlock's bed waits, like a life raft promising him warmth and safety.

He can tell by the dip in the pillow which side Sherlock favours, so he pulls back the blankets and climbs into the other side, nuzzling his nose against the bedding. It smells like Sherlock and soap. Heaven to his aching body. Muscles he hadn't realized he had been clenching begin to relax as he curls up on his side, facing the other half of the bed.

Sherlock goes and showered, scrubbing the rest of the blood off himself. Once he's clean he gets out and dries off before going to his room to get dressed. He lets the towel fall to the floor before pulling pants on and then his sleep flannel bottoms over them. ""Comfortable?"" He asks John as he texts Mycroft to send someone with the shots.

""Mmm, sheets are soft,"" John slurs while rubbing his face across the pillow. ""mine are all scratchy."" They smell nice too, like you.""

""Good."" Sherlock nods and gets into bed, relaxing on his side. ""How are you feeling? Have you eaten?""

""I can't recall the last thing I ate... but. I'm not hungry. The body sort of shuts down goes into hibernation mode. 'Specially for males, you don't want a lot of food in your system during a time you're supposed to be having nonstop sex.""

The blankets shift as Sherlock gets in. They slide and expose John's back to the cool night air. He tugs a corner close, then finds he has to nudge closer to Sherlock if he wants his back completely covered.

""When my shots arrive I'll make you some tea and toast."" Sherlock relaxes and turns towards John.

""Mm, just tea,"" John says around a yawn, shifting in the bed until his forehead is pressed against Sherlock's shoulder. ""I think I've turned the... thingy on, can't... remember ... to turn it off,"" he says brokenly, fighting off sleep.

""It's alright. Just relax."" Sherlock gently wraps his arm around John, holding him close.

John lets out a soft whine at the contact. Sherlock's bare skin is damp and still smells like his soap, the same soap John had used on himself earlier.

""I... this feels nice,"" John whispers moments before giving in and letting sleep take him.

Sherlock holds John, nuzzling John's hair. They stay like that for half an hour before Sherlock's phone vibrates. He reads the texts that his shots were there so he slowly gets up so he doesn't wake John. He goes downstairs and rolls his eyes when he opens the door. ""Mycroft.""

""Not a beta after all,"" Mycroft says, sniffing the air and frowning. ""Shall we expect a happy announcement by the end of the day?"" Mycroft points to a man, a beta underling, and points to the case Anthea is holding.

""A warning would have been nice, I might be older than you, but I still am an Alpha... his scent is... weak though. Not a full heat?""

""I wasn't expecting company. We'll do the jabs here."" Sherlock presents his arm to get it over with. ""He's taken care of it himself. I'm just here to make sure he's safe.""

""Mmm always the hero,"" Mycroft says, watching as his underling administers the shots. ""Taking care of more than one Omega in one night. Some might call that brave, but you know what I think.""

""You make your opinions known far and wide."" Sherlock sneers.

""Yes well, not everyone requires shots at half three in the morning, brother mine,"" Mycroft says as he turns around and heads back to his car, underlings following at his heel.

""I'll be by in a few days with the paperwork, he is unregistered, you know.""

""He won't sign anything under your pressure and I won't force him."" Sherlock snaps.

""Then fudge the details. Make it look real. Misspell a name, I don't care, Sherlock. It's to protect him as much as it is you."" Mycroft stops and turns back to his brother.

""What happens if he gets hurt while following you around London? Hmm? They won't treat him without an Alpha's consent, and that Alpha has to have claimed ownership of him. Worse yet, what if someone finds out he still has his service gun? Think about it, Sherlock. Both of you. I'll give you a few days.""

""I don't need your protection."" Sherlock snarls and slams the door, going back upstairs.

Sensing the change in mood John lift's his head and frowns at Sherlock when he comes back to bed. Sniffing once he wrinkles his nose.

""How was your brother? Annoying? Please tell me he was wearing a nightgown with one of those funny sleep hats that dangles past his chin.""

""No nightgown could cover his oversized arse,"" Sherlock grumbles as he tries to get comfortable. ""He was talking about you being unregistered.""

""Mm... 'strue. Military overrode my familial ownership. I was given a year to find an Alpha after being sent home... Technically I'm a ward of the Army, until then."" John says, instantly seeking out Sherlock's body for comfort once more.

Sherlock cuddles John to himself again. ""It's your choice. Whatever you need to do.""

""They need proof of a bond, or I get assigned a random Alpha,"" John mumbles, nuzzling his nose along Sherlock's neck. ""Don't want that. And I don't want to think about it right now. I just want to sleep right now.""

Sherlock growls softly, the thought of John being bonded against his will irritating. ""I won't let you be shipped off.""

""Not your usual case, and I can't pay well."" John yawns then slings his arm over Sherlock's stomach. ""Night, Sherlock...""

""You're not a case. You're my friend."" Sherlock holds him. ""Goodnight, John.""

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

The sun is well up when John finally wakes. There's a warm body beneath him, the rise and fall of their chest indicating that whoever his bedmate is, they're still asleep. John's cock is hard and aching, and over the course of the night, his pyjamas had grown damp with slick. He groans and nuzzles into the warmth, inhaling the calming scent of Sherlock.

Oh shit... Sherlock. John's eyes flash open and he half sits, wincing as his damp clothing sticks and slides uncomfortably across his arse. Sherlock is asleep, stretched out with one arm folded under his pillow, a typical Alpha sleep position. The other arm rests gently over John's lower torso. Thinking back, John vaguely remembered cleaning Sherlock's face, then crawling into bed.

Sherlock mumbles, his arm tightening around John's middle when he feels him move. Tired from the fight he had slept soundly. The slight fever from the injections made him not want to stay in bed.

As Sherlock sleepily pulls him back down into the cocoon of blankets, John finds he doesn't want to get up and flee for his bedroom. He and Sherlock had entered into the flatshare under the false pretense of a relationship. Since Sherlock had found out he was an Omega, all John could think about was what would happen if it wasn't a false relationship... what if it were real.

Laying his head on Sherlock's chest, his forehead brushes against Sherlock's cheek. He's warm, and out of habit, John feels the injection site. Warm, but not dangerously so. It's just the medication taking its course. He'd have to make sure that Sherlock drank plenty of clear fluids, and ate at least one solid meal, but he'd be fine by the end of the day.

Sherlock relaxes once John is against him again. He slept for a while longer before finally waking. ""Mm morning, John."" He mumbles, he had a slight headache and needed a coffee. ""How are you feeling?"" He rubs a hand over his face.

""Bout the same as yesterday..."" John shrugs then lies just a little, ""Don't think I'm any worse. You look like you've gotten into a fight or something. Caffeine, paracetamol, then lots of water today. Over exerting yourself in the fight means that today your muscles are breaking down toxins.""

They both lay there for a moment longer. Neither man willing to break apart. Neither of them willing to admit just how much they enjoyed the closeness. After a while though, John's situation made things difficult. His cock wouldn't soften, and the damp between his cheeks was only growing worse. Though he was loathed to move away from Sherlock's embrace, unsure if he'd ever be allowed to be this close to the Alpha again, necessity required him to change and use the bathroom.

""I erm... need a change of trousers... and for you to look away so I can get up without completely embarrassing myself.""

""Mm, I'll make coffee."" Sherlock nods and lets John go before getting up, shuffling out to the kitchen. ""Do you not remember last night?"" He asks, filling the coffee filter with a few scoops of coffee.

""Bits and pieces..."" John admits softly, following Sherlock through the kitchen. He felt grateful that Sherlock doesn't turn around, giving him privacy as he heads up to his room.

""I'll be down in a moment... fresh clothes.."" he says haltingly, heading up to his room where the window is still wide open.

Shutting the window he strips out of his soiled bottoms and slips on another pair of old and well broken in pyjamas. He'll need a shower, and by now those sex toys Sherlock had bought him were starting to sound appealing, but for now, he wanted tea, and just a few minutes to enjoy the lazy morning.

Sherlock waits for the coffee to drip, meanwhile, he decides to make toast. ""Which pieces?""

Sitting on the chair with the cushion, John thinks. ""I remember the movie and snacks. Then there was the whole handcuffing you to the radiator. Not sure I'll ever forget that."" He frowns a bit.

""You left... and I don't remember what I did, but my bedding is under my window, which suggests I was attempting to get fresh air. ""You came home late, then... there was blood, and judging by the bruise on your face it was yours?""

""Some of it."" Sherlock nods and sets a plate of toast in front of John with butter and jam so he can make it how he likes. He pours them both a coffee and tells John what happened the night before. ""The face you made when you smelled Mycroft on me was priceless."" He snorts.

""If I recall...."" John says around a smile, ""He smells like lemons that have been left out in the sun for too long."" John slathers butter, then jam, onto his toast and nibbles around the edge, eating the crust first. ""She's alright then? Did my contact help? Or was there another option?""

""It went as well as we could have hoped."" Sherlock nods. ""She'll be alright. Your contact is going to make sure she has somewhere safe and secure to stay.""

""Mm good.""

John shifts on the chair, wincing as another trickle of slick dampens his seat. ""I hate this part..."" He groans, pushing his half-eaten toast aside and laying his forehead on the table.

Sherlock frowns. ""I got some absorbent pads as well if you need them.."" He says softly, not wanting to upset John.

""Not sure I can tolerate pants right now... but if this gets any worse I'll have to suck it up.""

""I'm going to go lay down..."" Taking one final bite of his toast he picks up his mug and carries his coffee into the living room, where he promptly curls up on the sofa.

Sherlock finishes his coffee and cleans up from breakfast. ""Is there anything I can do?"" He asks, sipping a fresh cup of coffee as he walks into the living room.

""Bond me, fuck me, knot me, and make this all go away..."" John quips then winces as a wave of cramps hits.

""Cuddling helped, but I don't want you trapped in your bed all day. You're probably already sick of being cooped up with me""

""Ask me when you're not in the throes of a heat."" Sherlock snorts. ""What if I drag the mattress out here and we can watch something on the new projector?""

""Wouldn't it be easier just to move the projector?"" John grunts, then reaches for the heating pad Sherlock had bought for him.

""I'm not the genius here, but that makes more sense.""

""We can open the windows out here so you can get more fresh air."" Sherlock counters and sets his coffee mug down before plugging in the heating pad.

John grimaces at the living room. It would take a bit of effort to move everything in order to fit the mattress, but Sherlock wasn't wrong. Fresh air would help, and the two windows out here, versus the one they each had in their bedrooms, would allow for better circulation.

""Yeah, alright... Just, let me help?""

""It's fine. I'll just roll you onto the mattress."" Sherlock moves the furniture around and brings the mattress out, setting it in front of the couch so they could sit with their backs against the couch if they wanted. He opens the window, letting the fresh air in. ""Ready when you are.""

""Stubborn git,"" John grumbles, though the smile on his face lets Sherlock know he's anything but grumpy. ""We should watch something you like this time. What about unsolved mysteries?""

""Alright."" Sherlock smiles and gets them both some water and settles onto the mattress.

Joining him, John instantly curled up on his side, his head finding Sherlock's chest and finding it the perfect pillow. While Sherlock searched for something for John to watch, and him to shout at, John thought back over the last day and a half.

Since taking up the flatshare they'd been forced to pretend to be a couple. That meant going out of their way to touch each other as a couple might in front of Mrs. Hudson. Gentle touches, or passing brushes of hands against arms as they passed each other.

At first, it had required thought. But within a few weeks, John had found he did it automatically. He'd even noticed the jolt of excitement he'd feel when Mrs. Hudson would come up for a visit, and Sherlock would gravitate closer to him.

Now, knowing what it felt like to have Sherlock's arms around him, holding him tight, and sleeping next to the man. (Okay, sleeping on top of Sherlock, if he were being completely accurate.) John wasn't sure those casual touches would be enough for him anymore.

""I can't remember... real or a dream, Mycroft mentioned something about me needing to get registered again?""

""Unfortunately real."" Sherlock sighs. ""He has to stick his fat nose into everything. Especially where it doesn't belong. He's worried about me getting into legal trouble."" He rolls his eyes. ""I'm not even worried about it.""

""But I am. We both could face some serious problems... Did he tell you that I can't get medical care, emergency or otherwise until I'm registered? I can get the basics through the army, of course... but."" John shrugs against Sherlock's chest and sighs.

""I'll have to figure something out. Been toying with calling that number I gave you. One call, they'd pair me with an Alpha who would bond me, and then we'd never see each other again. He'd get all my legal requests, and just sign off on everything. Not ideal, but it's better than a forced bond where I'm stuck living with them.""

A deep angry growl slips from Sherlock's throat before he can stop it. ""Sorry.."" He apologizes, not having meant to growl like that.

""Mmm don't be sorry, I rather share that sentiment,"" John says gently while inwardly his chest puffs at the rich sound. It was nice to have someone angry on his behalf. Normally people just gave him a pitying glance and placating words of apology.

""What if.."" Sherlock starts and then stops, thinking. ""What if you registered with me?""

""Could do... but they'd need proof of a bond. Not sure how we'd get around that mountain of a detail."" John nudges his nose along Sherlock's chest, ""though... it isn't the worst idea. Quite possibly my best option. If I ended up in the A&E, that'll probably mean we were on a case, and you'd be by my side anyways. On hand for any paperwork.. so to speak.""

Sherlock nods. ""We could fake it. Prosthetics for a bond mark."" He rubs his fingers through John's hair.

""What if I don't want to fake it"" almost slips out before John clamps his mouth shut and just nods. Sherlock's offer was quite possibly the best offer he'd ever receive, and he didn't want to ruin it by scaring his friend off.

""Hit play,"" he says instead, leaning into the feeling of long fingers dancing across his head.

""I.."" Sherlock blinks. ""I've never thought about having an Omega but if I did I'd want one like you."" He says softly as he presses play.

""Mmm.."" John hums, opting for pleasant but noncommittal. He wants to turn around and press their chests together, then their mouths. To taste those lips that so often speak harsh but brilliant words. Instead, he focuses on the cheesy crime show and settles for nuzzling a bit closer, adjusting the heating pad so it covers his stomach.

Sherlock talks back to the show about how they're all idiots and wrong while he gently massages John's scalp. ""Honestly I don't know how any crime ever gets solved unless the perpetrator is standing there red-handed on film with eyewitnesses and holding their confession.""

""Greg would love that,"" John says with a laugh, then suddenly he's curling up and whimpering. His stomach cramps, deep shooting pains that go from his ribs to his groin, he feels like he's being flayed open. Slick oozes out of him, leaving him feeling undignified and wrecked as he struggles to think past the cramps.

Sherlock frowns. He rolls John onto his stomach and makes sure he stays in the heating pad. He moves behind John and massages his lower back. ""It's getting worse, John. Tell me what to do.""

""Not sure... my body is fighting back. It's been..."" He whimpers a bit and tries to think, ""ten years since my last heat. Not enough is known about Omega's who suppress their biology long term. It just... isn't done.""

John grits his teeth through the cramps and laughs pitifully, ""I'd be an interesting case to study... you should take notes.""

John suffers and Sherlock tries to make things better...


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

""You're not a subject. You're in pain.""Sherlock says around a frown, ""Should I get the toys?"" He begins massaging John's back and hips. ""You feel so tense.""

""God no. They're a last-ditch effort. But at this rate, I'll be out of clean clothes by the end of the day..."" Grunting John does his best to focus on Sherlock's fingers. ""That... helps.""

""I'll do laundry. And you can borrow mine."" Sherlock keeps massaging.

""Fuck me..."" John groans, more swearing than actually asking to be fucked. No one had warned him that it would be this bad, but then again it wasn't as if cases like John's were normal.

Most Omegas who joined the military ended up bonded to someone in their unit. As a couple, they'd be given furlough every six months to copulate. The omega was expected to refrain from getting pregnant until they were no longer on active duty, but it gave their body a chance to regulate.

John had opted out of that option. Then there was the simple fact that no one, aside from his CO, knew he was an Omega. Being a doctor allowed him the privilege of showering in the hospital, and private quarters. Both of which helped him maintain his secret.

Sherlock takes off his shirt and hands it to John before continuing to massage. He works down John's leg, over his back, and back down the other leg. ""I'm sorry. I'm sure being close to an Alpha isn't making this better. Maybe I should leave you be.""

""I think it would be worse, knowing I'm alone."" John grunts, stuffing the soft shirt as close to his nose as he can without actually shoving it by his nose. ""You help... your scent helps. Please don't leave me alone."" From their vantage point, he can see the bag containing the toys, a low growl fills his chest. ""Not with them. I will not be reduced to fucking myself with a synthetic cock.""

""What if I fuck you with it?"" Sherlock asks, leaning in and scenting John by scrubbing his face along the back of John's neck.

""I don't want them. God, Sherlock."" John growls out, rubbing his neck against Sherlock's face. ""I want you, can't you see that? But it would be incredibly stupid because anything right now would result in me carrying your pups. And while I'm not against the idea, I need time to think, to process everything without having to pick out baby names.""

""When your heat is over we'll discuss it."" Sherlock nuzzles his scent gland. ""What can I do to help you now?""

""We'll discuss it? You're not saying no.."" John practically melts into the mattress with relief. He'd been so worried over losing the constant touches and kindness from the Alpha, that his body had reacted to the stress by intensifying his symptoms. As he relaxed, the cramps subsided and he let out a sigh. ""Just... keep rubbing me. Erm, my back, that is. Unless... no bad idea.""

""You're the best thing that ever happened to me, John. I can't say no to you. We'll talk when you're able to consent and have a coherent conversation."" Sherlock keeps rubbing. ""It's not a bad idea if it helps. Where do you want my hands?""

""Anywhere... everywhere. I want to feel you touch every inch of my body, and I want to touch yours."" John says, closing his eyes and humming at the feel of Sherlock's fingers pressing into tender muscles.

""You can touch me, John. Any way you'd like."" Sherlock works his hands over John's tight muscles, making sure to keep them from his crotch or arse.

At Sherlock's words, John lets out a low mewling noise. He surges forward, pulling himself up into his elbow quick as a flash, then acts before Sherlock has time to react. Using his legs for leverage he grips Sherlock's biceps and flips him onto his back, laying him flat against the mattress. John straddles Sherlock's hips and moans when his cock presses up against Sherlock's groin.

""Fuck..."" Leaning forward he places his forehead against Sherlock's chest and shudders.

It's hard to keep his hips still, but he manages and after a long moment he sits up, placing both his palms on Sherlock's chest he begins letting his fingers explore over pale skin.

Sherlock smiles up at him, a blush over his cheeks at being manhandled. ""You can grind against me if you need to. I won't stop you."" He rubs his hands over John's thighs.

""Mm probably a bad idea,"" John groans, ""not sure I can control myself if I start that. Let me just touch you for now. Put your hands on my back.""

Sherlock nods, pressing his big warm hands to John's back. ""Have you ever touched an Alpha like this John? Ever imagined an Alpha would submit to your needs?""

""I've never been touched by an Alpha at all,"" John admits, rolling his back against the broad hands splayed against his skin. He drags his fingers across the various scars on Sherlock's body.

""I never let myself show as an Omega. It was embarrassing for my family to have me go into heat. My heats have been suppressed since a young age, and I've done all I can to pass as a beta."" John scoffs, his face going sour. ""Can't get the wrong attention if you just hide your whole life.""

""You don't have to hide anymore, John. You don't have to hide from me. I'll keep you safe. I won't let anyone hurt you."" Sherlock promises, on hand coming up and rubbing against John's scent gland in his neck.

They may have started out faking their relationship but after a few weeks into the ruse, Sherlock had told Lestrade the truth. Not only did he tell him that it was fake but he also told Lestrade that he wishes it wasn't. How he was afraid to lose John by being too Sherlock or that John would leave him for someone else.

""I've never.. I've never wanted anyone as close to me as you are. People are so stupid and hateful, John. But you. You're brilliant. You're so strong and brave. You make me laugh until it hurts. I can't imagine working or living without you. You've become a center point of my life. I was adrift and I didn't even know it until you limped into my view and changed everything. I said it before, I'm at your mercy."" He rubs John's back and hips. He knew John's pheromones were affecting him. He couldn't feel it. But if anything they made it easier for him to say what he'd been holding back instead of making up, or suppressing feelings.

""I.. I want to kiss you. For real. Not just a quick peck for our land lady's sake"" John sighs, his hips rolling against Sherlock as if acting on their own free will.

""It stopped being fake for me weeks ago, John."" Sherlock blushes, angling his hips a bit so John can get better friction.

John surges forward at Sherlock's admission. With his chest flat against Sherlock's chest, he plants one hand beside Sherlock's face, the other hand cupping stubbly skin. He rubs their noses together, then presses his thin lips against Sherlock's full lips. He moans upon contact, hips sliding and his left hand playing with Sherlock's jawline. The moment is bliss, and John finds himself wanting to stay like that, never to move again.

Sherlock wraps his arms tight around John, holding him close as they kiss. He pulls back just enough to lick at John's neck. ""When this heat is over we'll talk. We'll figure out what we both want. What we need. For now, I'm going to kiss you as my life depends on it."" He mumbles, his voice rumbling deep in his chest before he kisses John again.

John gasps as Sherlock's tongue slides over his neck. It's the first time an Alpha has ever touched him there. He shivers and falls into Sherlock's words, wrapping the promise around him like a blanket.

""My life does depend on it,"" He says greedily, and while it isn't exactly true, it feels right. Every fiber of his body is screaming to be close to Sherlock, to touch and be touched.

Sherlock's tongue slides across his lips and he parts them, letting it dip inside him. Their first breach of two becoming one. Sherlock gently teases and explores John's mouth with his tongue, his fingers finding their way to John's hair and pulling just enough to make him groan. He holds John's hip in his other hand and rocks his hips up against John's. He can feel John's slick starting to dampen his pants.

""Sherlock..."" John gasps, rolling his lower half against the grip and the friction. ""I... I want to come, is that okay?""

His body desperately needs another orgasm, even if achieved without any form of internal stimulants. It feels good, amazing even, to have those long fingers digging into his hips, ghosting over skin, every now and then dipping below his waistband. He can feel Sherlock's length against him, hard and hot, the heady scent of Sherlock's matching desire filling his nose.

John breaks away from the kiss and gives into his most basic instinct. He rubs his neck and cheeks against Sherlock's body, his neck, his chest, his face. He wants Sherlock to smell like him, to claim him so the rest of the Omegas knew that this Alpha was courting someone else.

Sherlock groans, rubbing his face against John's neck. ""Will you come on me? Mark me? Claim me? Make sure all the other Omega's know I'm yours? I want that. Please, John.""

""Yeah... yeah."" John husks out, swallowing a lump of emotion as he reaches down and fumbles with his trousers. He manages to get them partially off, hanging on by one leg only. He doesn't care, it's enough to free his cock, and that's all that matters. He wants to see Sherlock's cock, compare them and rub their erections together, but just the simple act of touching himself is already sending him over the edge.

Reaching between his legs he gathers some of his slick on his fingertips and coats his cock with it. It takes less than a dozen strokes before he's shaking and crying Sherlock's name. Milky come oozes from his tip and drips onto Sherlock's taught stomach, the sight causing John to growl through his ecstasy. Once he's spent, he slides his fingers through the mess on Sherlock's stomach and hums appreciatively, smearing it into Sherlock's skin and enjoying the way their two scents combine.

Sherlock growls, not one of anger or aggression but of need and want. ""Mine. My Omega. I'll be your Alpha. I'll be so good to you. Whatever you need. Whatever you want. Yours. All yours."" He licks his lips as he watches John come.

Sherlock's words cloud John's judgment. He'd long scoffed at silly Omegas who bend over backward at being claimed. But now hearing those words, he finds he wants to hear them again and again.

Without thinking he moves until He's sitting on Sherlock's calves. He paws at the waistband of Sherlock's pyjamas and claws them down to his thighs. His cock is hard, and massive, the perfect specimen of Alpha. There's no swollen knot, telling John that above all odds Sherlock has retained some control over himself.

He leans forward and rubs his cheek against the firm velvety skin, then wraps his lips around its crown. He glances up, his intention clear. He wants to taste Sherlock, taste the Alpha who'd been kind when others would claim and take.

""You can do whatever you'd like. But I won't fuck you. Not yet. Not until we're both sane and clear-headed."" Sherlock groans, his cock hard and pulsing.

It takes a bit more effort than it had for himself, but before long he can smell the change in Sherlock. He was close, and John wanted every ounce of come inside him. And if the Alpha wouldn't fuck it into him, then he'd just have to swallow it. Wrapping one hand around the base, John moves his head faster, sucking harder and rolling his tongue. He can't fit Sherlock fully into his mouth, but he does his best.

""John... John... John!"" Sherlock babbles and chants, John's name, a plea, and a prayer on his lips. His cock throbs for John and soon it's all too much. John's smell, his warmth, his attention, his mouth. It's too much. Then Sherlock is coming, filling John's mouth with his hot potent come.

John's Omega side sings and preens as Sherlock's come bursts into his mouth and throat. He swallows, not wanting to waste a single drop. He sucks until Sherlock is thoroughly spent and is twitching below him. Only then does John let Sherlock's softening cock slide from his mouth. He climbs off of Sherlock's legs and curls up against Sherlock's side, closing his eyes and humming happily.

""Maybe... I'll let you use those toys on me, if I get to do that again."" He says smugly, enjoying the way his Alpha tastes in his mouth.

""Mm, I'll do anything you want. As soon as I can feel my body again."" Sherlock slurs a bit as he wraps his arm around John. He hadn't come in years and he certainly never came like that.

Tugging John impossibly close he nuzzles her hair and scents him, wanting John to be smothered in him. ""How are you feeling?""

""Mmm..."" John thinks, consulting his body with a sluggish inward gaze, ""better, I think. Orgasms help, you help. Was that.. okay? I should have asked.""

""If that's what orgasms are supposed to feel like, maybe I'll partake more."" Sherlock kisses John's head. ""It was phenomenal.""

""Mmm, they can be nice, if shared with the right person. Solo missions are a bit like finding cheese in the fridge and planning a meal around it, just to find out the cheese is mouldy.""

John nuzzles close and drags a blanket up over their exposed bodies.

""Going to have a nap, wake me if the flat catches on fire.""

""I'll just carry you out."" Sherlock rubs his fingers through John's hair.

John grins as he falls asleep, the thought of Sherlock carrying a naked Omega through flames somehow felt perfectly them.

With John's pseudo heat behind them, they discuss bonding and what that means.

Hope you're enjoying this! We have a fun twist coming up soon! - Tindo

John sleeps for the better part of an hour, and when he wakes he finds the cramps have subsided and a dry uncomfortable feeling tells him he's stopped producing slick.

""Sherlock?"" he groans, lifting a head and finding the Alpha watching him. He can still taste Sherlock in his mouth, so he doesn't have to ask if the blow job was real. Instead, he just gives the Alpha a small smile, then nuzzles his face against his chest.

""Your heat seems to have broken."" Sherlock rubs Johns's back. ""You stopped smelling so strong about twenty minutes ago. How do you feel?""

""I've been better, but I've also been worse. My arms don't ache from fucking myself. Can't imagine that would have done my shoulder any favours."" John sighs and shifts under the blanket. He needs the bathroom, but at the same time, he doesn't want to leave Sherlock's side.

Sherlock nods. ""How about I order us some takeaway and we can share a shower while it's on the way?"" He offers, knowing John needs to eat and his alpha instincts wanting to provide for his omega.

""There's still half of yesterday's curry in the fridge... get something that pairs with it, like.. more curry."" John says with a grin, as the words ""we, share and shower"" sink in.

""Please tell me you enjoy hot showers that melt your skin off.""

""More curry."" Sherlock chuckles and gets his phone, sending a text for the order. ""I'll boil the water myself if you want."" He snorts.

Kicking off his pyjamas, which still clung to one leg, John gets up and stretches, unashamed of being naked in broad daylight.

He gets to the bathroom first, and steps into the shower, flicking the water on, he ramps up the hot water and stands under the spray while waiting for Sherlock.

Once the Alpha has joined him, he gives Sherlock a few moments under the water, then crowds him against the shower wall.

""I remember everything, every nice thing you did for me. Every promise, every touch."" He whispers, lips ghosting along with Sherlock's ear. ""You, Sherlock Holmes, are one very sexy Alpha.""

""Good because I meant every word."" Sherlock runs his hands over John's wet hot skin. He teases his fingertips over John's low back, nearly touching his arse.

""I want you to bond me... during my next heat. I want you, Sherlock."" John says, his eyes fluttering closed under Sherlock's touches.

""If you're willing, I'll skip my suppressants, let myself have a natural, unhindered heat, and we can bond... become one. And if you're willing, we'll have to have a serious talk about expectations, children, shared spaces... ownership.."" The last word slides off John's tongue like acrid grease, but there is little he can do about it.

Once bonded, legally his rights turnover and belong to his Alpha, it wasn't ideal, but he felt safe in Sherlock's hands.

""I would not be owning you, John. If anything you'd be owning me. You're the more stable, more human one."" Sherlock nuzzles him. ""I want to bond with you. Not bond you to me but us to each other. We'll still solve cases and eat takeaway. You'll still have rows with the chip n pin machine and I'll still make a mess of the flat. Nothing has to change so dramatically. We'll just be each other, formally and legally. I have no interest in owning you or being your warden. You're a grown man who can certainly take care of himself. The jury is still out on me on that account."" He chuckles softly.

""Yeah well, try telling the government that,"" John laughs, nuzzling along Sherlock's wet neck.

""Just sign the damned paper. It'll be like our secret, getting one up on the governing body of idiots.""

Sherlock hums softly, thinking. ""You may be on to something there, John..""

""Course I am."" John giggles then reaches behind Sherlock for the bottle of expensive body wash.

He squeezes a palm-full of the blue gel into his hand then replaces the bottle. Lathering it up between his hands he looks up at Sherlock and shrugs.

""Lots of mates do it... If they're true mates. The Alpha understands that it's a joint bonding, and just signs the bloody paperwork so the government leaves them alone. I think... I'd be able to call you my mate. It feels right, saying it even now.""

John places his palms on Sherlock's chest and begins working the rich lather over Sherlock's body. When he reaches the spot where his come had been, he smiles and skips over the area, wanting to preserve some of his scent on Sherlock's body.

""But the paperwork goes one way. The alpha assumes control of the omega. What if we did it both ways?"" Sherlock relaxes under John's touch.

""It doesn't exist."" John shrugged. ""Not that I haven't thought about that, but it would take reforming the whole system.""

John guides Sherlock to turn, so he can soap up his back, and arse, hands moving automatically with his familiarity with the human body.

""Sure, such a proposition would be met with praise and welcomed arms by so many. But the upper class, those with money and power, would squash any rays of hope before any new bill even had the chance to be voted on. People have tried, Alphas like you, who understand that I'm human, not a baby factory.""

John sighs and presses a kiss to the back of Sherlock's shoulder.

""But it never passes. The rich like owning things and that includes Omegas. What would they do if they couldn't own something they'd grown accustomed to having their whole life?""

""You're thinking too large scale. Just because the law doesn't have a statute for it doesn't mean we can't do it. We can draft our own contract within the bonding contract. There are always amendments in bonding paperwork, usually for the benefit of the alpha. We can make our own amendments and add whatever we like. It'll set a new president and they won't be able to change it because it is a contract between a private citizen and their intended mate."" Sherlock lets John do as he likes.

""Could work,"" John muses, dipping his hands low over Sherlock's body, fingers skimming his inner thighs.

""It would require a good lawyer from a firm that's been around ages. If the wrong Alpha is set to record our contract, and he reads the terms, he might push back.""

John's fingers dip between Sherlock's arse cheeks, then back down his thighs before John is turning them so his back is pressed against the wall and Sherlock standing under the water.

""I'd rather not involve my brother but he would have the connections."" Sherlock sighs. He reaches out for the shower gel and starts to rub sudsy hands over John. ""You mentioned children..""

""Yeah well... with me it's a biological possibility. Most suppressors have a contraceptive in them, but there are some that don't.""

John closes his eyes and sighs as Sherlock's hands roam over him.

""I've never really given it much thought, figured I'd never meet an Alpha worth two shits, so it didn't pertain to me.""

Sherlock washes and massages John's shoulders as he listens to him. ""What about now? Are pups something that you'd want?""

""Erm,"" John stops and thinks. Imagining what life would be like with the sounds of shrieking children running about. ""It isn't a terrible thought, as long as they're half yours. But I'm not exactly jumping up and down at the thought of rushing into it.""

He cracks a grin, remembering Sherlock's complaint the previous night.

""You could train them to solve crimes, send them off as interns to teach those coppers from that show how to solve a murder. They'd be smart, just like you, of that I'm sure.""

""They'd be able to take over the Yard before they were out of nappies."" Sherlock smirks. ""And I'm not the only smart one, John. You're a doctor, a brilliant surgeon. A lifesaver. I may be smart but they'd have your kindness and compassion as well. Maybe just a bit of your temper."" He chuckles.

He works his hands down John's body, washing away the dried slick.

""But you're right. I'm certainly in no rush. It'll probably take me quite some time to figure out how to be in a relationship let alone take care of a pup."" He says softly.

""It's... interesting,"" John sighs, enjoying Sherlock's fingers gliding over his arse and thighs. He arches into the touch and continues, his voice a bit more husky, ""Imagining what a human would be like having both of our traits. One minute they'd be pouting and throwing a Sherlock-sized temper tantrum, the next they'd be stomping their foot demanding an ice lolly at the top of their lungs.""

He smiles a little, realizing he wasn't totally against the idea of children. He still had a few more childbearing years left in him, and he felt a small clench in the pit of his stomach.

""I'm going to need time to adjust to this as well. Years of fighting off my body's need for an Alpha is going to make this tough. I might snap at you, and push you away once in a while. If I do, I'm sorry...""

""I've never been in any kind of relationship before so I'm sure I will screw up plenty."" Sherlock hums as he finishes washing John, watches the suds slowly slide down John's skin. ""If you don't ever want pups that's fine. If you do we'll talk about it when the time comes.""

John smiles and nods then reaches for Sherlock's shampoo. Afraid of getting it in Sherlock's eyes, he washes his own hair and passes the bottle over.

""Maybe someday."" He agrees, amazed at how easy it had been to reach an agreement on a topic that caused so many fights. ""I'll make sure to get a contraceptive today and start taking it right away. That way there are no accidents with my next heat.""

Leaning his head under the spray of water he washes the shampoo from his hair then says, ""What about normal heats... they're roughly every three months, though my body might be a bit out of sync. Do you want me to have them, or should I take suppressants again after we bond?""

""That is completely up to you. It is your body and your heats. I don't have any right to tell you how you should manage them."" Sherlock tips his head under the spray, washing the shampoo out. ""I will say that I think after being on suppressants for so long and your body's reaction to this heat that maybe you should try going suppressant-free and see how that works for you. If it's too much you can go back on suppressants. Whatever you choose I'll support you.""

""Could be inconvenient... if we're on a case."" John sighs, ""I can't control when they happen, just if they happen.""

He thinks about it and nods, letting Sherlock have his turn with the water.

""But you're right. I should let my body normalize a bit. Those military-grade suppressors are something else. Work like a charm, but they clearly fucked with me. I wasn't even supposed to have a heat, it was just supposed to be a period of discomfort that I was supposed to wait out, then swap brands.""

""Cases hold. And if it won't then someone else can solve it unless it's dire. We'll just keep an eye out and see if your heats fall into a cycle. Either way, we can work it out. I can review evidence while you're sleeping between rounds."" Sherlock shrugs as he rinses.

""You make it sound so... simple."" John glances over at Sherlock before stepping out of the shower. ""Thank you.""

""I don't like struggling. Every situation has an answer and can be resolved. If you're going to be my omega that makes you more important than the Work."" Sherlock says and then blinks, never having thought anything would be more important than the work let alone an omega.

""That sounds... strange."" John laughs, grabbing a second towel he passes it to Sherlock. ""But I can see by your stunned expression that it's genuine.""

Wrapping the towel around his hips, he grabs his toothbrush and begins washing the fuzzy feeling off his teeth. He'll need to go upstairs and change, but for now, he's happy staying in the humid warmth of the bathroom while they wait for food to arrive.

Sherlock nods as he dries himself. ""I've never thought of anything besides the work. I mean drugs for a bit there but that was just between cases to fill the void. I'm not sure what this means exactly.""

""Neither am I, if that makes you feel any better,"" John says around a mouthful of toothpaste. He spits into the sink then pops the toothbrush back into his mouth.

""My whole life I've been running from Alphas. Avoiding communal showers, or contact sports... God, I missed rugby. We got a good team going back in Afghanistan. With those blockers I could play again, that was heaven.""

Spitting again, he rinses off his toothbrush and leans against the sink.

""I avoided any scenario that would out me as being anything other than a Beta. Even though it was hard explaining how a bonded Alpha and Omega produced a beta, it was easier than saying what I truly was. I would have been sold off, Sherlock... become the property of one of London's elitists. Men like your brother...""

Sherlock growls at the mention of his brother, like a spectator over their happiness. ""Sorry. He just pisses me off. We've been having this fight since I woke up in the hospital after getting the shit beat out of me in school""

""Siblings, huh?"" John says, rolling his eyes. ""You should meet Harry. She claims I drove her to drink by my refusal to accept who I was.""

Pushing himself up off the sink John runs his hand over Sherlock's jaw. ""I like the stubble... it's rugged.""

With that, he lets his hand drop and heads upstairs for clothes. Catching sight of the mess in the sitting room he smiles. The effort Sherlock had gone to in order to make him comfortable made his heart flutter and butterflies take root in his stomach.

Sherlock looks at himself in the mirror as he brushes his teeth. He decides not to shave and keeps the stubble, he would deny it had anything to do with John. He got dressed and was just about done fixing his hair when the food delivery arrived downstairs. He headed down and got the food when he heard the knock.

Dressed in comfortable trousers, and a cotton t-shirt, John joins Sherlock in the kitchen.

He smiles at the dark stubble on Sherlock's chin but doesn't say anything.

While Sherlock lays the new food out, he goes to the fridge and re-heats the curry from earlier.

""So... I um, gave you a blowjob."" John says the moment Sherlock places a fork full of food in his mouth. ""Good?"" He asks, letting Sherlock decide if he meant the blowjob or the food.

""John, I couldn't feel my legs for a good five minutes. I think that means it was very good."" Sherlock blushes a bit. ""No one has ever done that for me before.""

John grins, then tucks into his meal. ""Good.""

While he eats, he finds himself thankful for the way things had turned out. If Sherlock had taken offense to his biology, things would have been incredibly different right now. He might not even have a home anymore.

When half his meal is gone, he looks up and catches Sherlock's eye.

""Can I call you 'my Alpha' even before we bond? Or... would you like time to get used to this?""

""In my head, I'm already referring to you as my omega, an unconscious switch on my part, so whatever you'd like."" Sherlock nods as he rips a section of naan and uses it to scoop some food. ""My brother is going to be insufferable about this."" He rolls his eyes.

""Let's not tell him until we need him to babysit,"" John says, his lips quirking up into a smirk.

""Knowing his goons he'd probably know you were carrying a pup before you did."" Sherlock snorts. ""And besides if we ever need a babysitter he is the last on the list behind Molly and Mrs. Hudson and my homeless network.""

""Mm you'd know before I knew."" John countered, still smiling at the thought of dropping a screaming child into the lap of Mycroft Holmes. It would be an added bonus if said child came with a full nappy.

""My scent would change almost instantly. Might take you a week or two to notice, but you'll know long before I can sense the change.""

Finishing his food, John scoops a bit more curry onto his plate and swipes some Naan through the sauce.

""So, what do we do in the meantime, while we wait for my next heat? Go back to normal? I go back to my room, you to yours? We... what? Kiss occasionally?""

""First we register together and get that out of the way so neither you nor I get in trouble. Then we make our own bond contact."" Sherlock finishes his last bite. ""I would like kisses to be a bit more often than occasional."" He can't help the blush creeping over his high cheekbones.

""Me too... and I'd like to not always sleep alone,"" John adds, feeling his face mirroring Sherlock's blush.

""I enjoyed sleeping beside you.""

""As do I."" Sherlock smiles. ""You also haven't had any nightmares while we've been sharing sleeping arrangements.""

John pauses, his mouth hanging open. It was true, normally his heats came with terrible nightmares. Before ware they were scenarios of less than favourable situations where he'd been caught out on the cusp of his heat, unable to seek shelter as bodies closed in around him.

After war, they'd morphed into strange scenarios where his former friends would rise from the dead and blame him for being an Omega for the reason they weren't still alive.

""Not one,"" he breathed.

""That's a good thing. Right?"" Sherlock asks softly, looking a bit unsure.

""Amazing."" John nods.

They share a small smile, then John stretches his foot out under the table, making contact with Sherlock's. And it was enough.

Both their bodies leaned into the touch. Sherlock's other foot stretched out and met his. They sat like that for a while, talking softly about their hopes for the future, and of past cases.

When the food was gone, John tried not to make a big deal over Sherlock offering to help clean up. Instead, he just passed Sherlock the tea towel and let him dry the dishes.

When the kitchen was cleaned up, they tackled the living room together, replacing Sherlock's mattress to its proper place, replacing the furniture, and mostly shutting the windows.

A passerby below sniffed hard, and glanced up as John leaned out to grab the window, he smirked up at him, a knowing look on his face.

John found he didn't hate being looked at like an Omega. It was fine, as long as he was Sherlock's omega.

Sherlock goes to John and looks out the window. He snarls when he sees the man down on the sidewalk. ""Keep moving or I'll cut you from cock to chin!"" He snaps.

John barks out a laugh and pulls Sherlock back into the flat.

""Alright, Alpha, calm your tits.""

Leaning up on tiptoes he pressed a kiss to Sherlock's cheek.

Sherlock leans in and nuzzles John, resting his hands on his hips. ""Sorry. That may have been a bit overboard.""

""Perhaps, a bit."" John agrees though he's smiling. ""I don't mind, but let's not go alienating our neighbors.

""There you go being socially conscious again."" Sherlock teases and smiles.

""One of us has to be.""

Giggling he wraps his arms around Sherlock's middle and pulls him tight against his chest.

""Now what? We just waltz into the nearest registration office and demand a blank contract form?""

""We could and time how long it takes my brother to arrive."" Sherlock snorts.

""Let's do that tomorrow. I have a better idea. You said you'd touch me after my heat is over. Well, it's over.""

John raises an eyebrow at Sherlock and nods towards his bedroom.

""There's a lovely, freshly made bed that I would love to mess up.""

Sherlock blushes and nods. ""Perhaps it's too fresh and clean.""

""Oh?"" John stops. Planting both hands on his hips he quirks his head up at Sherlock. ""Is that your way of saying that one orgasm is good enough this year?""

""No, I just-"" Sherlock starts.

""SHERLOCK HOLMES! You get down here this instant!"" Mr. Hudson calls from downstairs.

John and Sherlock share a look, and then John shrugs.

""After you, she sounds mad. I'll let my big scary Alpha go first.""

Sherlock bites his lip and goes down the stairs.

""Why are there purple stains on my carpet?"" Mrs. Hudson points down to the carpet where bright purple stains had marred her carpet.

""Well you see I needed some dye for an experiment and I didn't know that the bottle had a hole."" Sherlock looks apologetic. ""I did try to scrub them out.""

John stands back and crosses his arms over his chest. He does his absolute best not to smile, or show that he's getting any enjoyment out of Sherlock being cowed by a small elderly Beta woman, but truthfully, he was thoroughly enjoying it.

""Do I even want to know why you needed purple dye, or *when* you needed it... you've erm.. been quite busy the last few days.""

""The organs you got me."" Sherlock blushes.

""You are going to scrub my carpet and get these drips out. You're a chemist, you should be able to figure out how to get dye out of fibers."" Mrs. Hudson tsks. ""Tea, John?"" He leads John to the kitchen.

""Feeling better?"" The landlady asks, pushing John into a chair while she fills the kettle.

""Better.. yeah."" John stammers, remembering the taste of Sherlock's cock in his mouth. ""Just a short bug. Must have picked it up from the clinic.""

Sherlock goes about cleaning the carpet.

""Poor thing. Sherlock was so nervous."" Mrs. Hudson pours them both a cup of tea.

""Mmm, came on fast. New tea?"" John asks, attempting to steer the conversation away from his supposed illness.

Mrs. Hudson nods and launches into a whole story about how her usual tea wasn't available at her tea shop and the girl at the counter recommended this one. ""But I'm not sure I like this one."" She looks at her cup.

""I like it,"" John says, smiling kindly at the woman. He looks around her kitchen and spots an old photo of her, a few years younger posing beside a tall man with curly dark hair. Though his skin has some color, and his chin a little less refined, he recognizes Sherlock instantly. A thought comes to him, and he bites his lip.

""While his nibs is busy..."" John whispers, ""You've known Sherlock for a long time... Was it a surprise to you, to learn he and I were a couple? Has he had relationships in the past? He says he hasn't, and I'm inclined to believe him.. but.. You know, curious minds, and all that.""

""I've known Sherlock for a long time. He helps me with some sticky business with my late husband."" Mrs. Hudson sips her tea. ""I was surprised when he said he had someone. He kept the details vague, at first, I thought he was shaming. But then you showed up with him and I've never seen a better match."" She smiles. ""He's never brought anyone home or anything like that. Before he got clean.."" She thinks how to say it delicately.

Sherlock comes into the kitchen and gets swim cleaners from under the sink before going back to the other room.

""Before he got clean his brother cut him off from all the family money. I let him crash at a flat I owned on Montague Street so he'd have somewhere warm and safe to stay. Some people would come and go but they wouldn't stay very long. I realized that they were drug dealers."" Mrs. Hudson makes a face.

She gets up and gets some biscuits from the cupboard before sitting back down.

""I told him that if he didn't clean up his act that I wouldn't speak to him again. He told me he didn't care and said all sorts of rude things, which I don't hold against him. I know what drugs do to a person."" She nods, dunking her biscuit into her tea. ""He disappeared for about a week before coming back and begging for forgiveness.""

""Addiction is hard. But I'm glad he had you, Mrs. H.""

John sits and mulls over the information. He didn't know much about Sherlock's past, aside from that there had been an addiction problem. Then there was whatever was going on between Sherlock and his brother. Part of John just imagined that it was sibling rivalry, as only the Holmes knew how to display.

""I should go make sure he hasn't passed out from fumes. Thanks for the tea.""

Finishing the last dregs of his tea John stands and pats the landlady's shoulder. Going out into the other room he leans on the doorframe and watches Sherlock with a small smirk.

""Need any help, or can I just sit here and admire the view. And by view, I mean your arse.""

Sherlock blushes as he scrubs, from John's words rather than the exertion from scrubbing. ""It's starting to come up but I don't think they come out completely.""

""Mm, keep wiggling back and forth like that and something else is going to ... Oh, hello, Mrs. H. Sherlock's got the worst of it up,"" John says sweetly, hearing the landlady behind him.

She titters about, suggesting a few different cleaning chemicals before leaving the two men alone again.

""Do you get your trousers tailored to your arse just to impress me, or do you just like the way it feels, having them fit you like a second skin.""

John feels the growl bubble in his chest and covers it by clearing his throat.

""Sorry, I think I might still be a bit... ill""

Sherlock chuckles softly. ""I may wear tighter trousers around you than not."" He smirks a bit. ""Oh."" He looks surprised and looks up at John. ""Would you like to top?""

""Top... top what?"" John says, looking around confused.

""Me."" Sherlock stands. ""Would you like to fuck me, John?""

""Oh... top, as in.. in the bedroom.""

John rolls his head back, leaning it against the wooden frame of the door, and shrugs.

""That's all I know, aside from toys, I haven't had anyone inside me. Ever. Beta's don't care who's doing the work, as long as everyone has an orgasm. I've had sex, but only with Beta's, and mostly women. I guess.. what I'm trying to say in a very roundabout way, Sherlock."" John sighs and lifts his head up, locking his gaze with Sherlock's. ""I want to try it all. With you.""

Sherlock takes three strides to John and cups his cheek in one hand before leaning in and kissing him.

""Mmm."" John hums, dropping his hand onto Sherlock's hip, though he wrinkles his nose at the stink of chemicals on Sherlock's hands. ""Finish up here, and meet me upstairs.""

Pulling away from Sherlock he slides his hands over Sherlock's arse then heads up the stairs. He goes up the second flight of stairs to his room. He takes his favourite pillow and heads back to Sherlock's room.

Sherlock scrubs for a while longer until all the spots were just a light hue of purple.

John's heat isn't ready to give up the ghost yet. Sherlock helps him through one last aftershock.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


When Sherlock joins John in his bedroom, John has his pillow stuffed under his head and a nest of blankets wrapped around him. He smiles lazily up from his nest and pats the bed beside him.



""Joining me?""



Sherlock smiles softly and climbs into the nest. ""How are you feeling?"" He nuzzles John, holding him close.



""Tired, mostly, still a little... erm, horny for lack of a better word."" John leans into Sherlock's nuzzling, tilting his head back, giving the alpha access to his neck so he can be scented.



""I love smelling like you,"" he admits, rubbing the side of his face against the stubble on Sherlock's chin.



Sherlock scents John, kissing his neck gently. ""I like it as well. It's.. satisfying when you smell like me.""



He gently rubs his stubble against John's jaw, rubbing against his omega. ""Can I help with the horny feeling?""



""Mm, perhaps."" John grins, rocking his hips against Sherlock's body. ""What are you open to? Do you want to just... this,"" he asks, rutting his erection against Sherlock's. ""Or... I'd let you have me.""



Sherlock thinks as he kisses John's neck. ""I want to suck your cock and eat your arse."" He mumbles as he licks John's scent gland.



""God, yes... please."" John moans, rolling his head into his pillow, letting Sherlock's nose slide further back along his jawline. ""would you?""



""Yes."" Sherlock teasingly drags his teeth over John's neck before kissing down his body.



John kicks his pants off and pulls away from Sherlock long enough to tear his shirt off. ""Clothes... off,"" he mutters, pawing at Sherlock's shirt.



Sherlock chuckles and strips, naked over his omega.



""Sherlock.."" John sigh, their bare chests touching, ""I want you inside me, any part of you, please. Tongue, finger, cock. Show me what it feels like, please?""



""I'll fuck you later when your heat is gone for sure."" Sherlock kisses him deeply before moving down between John's legs.



John hooks his legs up over Sherlock's shoulders and settles back against the bed. Sherlock nudges his nose against his groin, his cheek sliding against his cock.



""Sherlock, more... please?""



John's voice is a low whisper as if he's scared that a full volume might scare Sherlock off.



Sherlock takes his time, kissing John's cock from base to tip, and watches John for his reactions.



John slams his head back against the pillow and arches his back. Sherlock's mouth is like wildfire, spreading across his cock, his tongue like hot flames, licking their way across his skin. He imagines that every touch leaves a visual mark, a brand showing that Sherlock is claiming his body as his own.



Afraid that, should anyone get too close and see the biological difference, John had (until now) avoided receiving blowjobs. It was one thing to fuck in dim lighting, another to allow someone's head to be inches away from the secret he'd been avoiding since his early teens.



John grips the sheets tight as Sherlock's lips suck in his crown, his tongue sliding along his skin like butter on warm bread.



""Sher..."" he gasps, rocking forward and trying to sink his cock deeper into the wet heat. But Sherlock moves with him, chuckling as he maintains the barely-there contact.



""Fuu.."" John tries to swear, but the word is lost in his throat when a slender finger glides over his entrance.



So close to his heat, the area is still loose and willing to accept the intrusion. Sherlock's finger slides inside, and John feels a wet rush of slick glide out of him.



""Ahhh."" he cries, tense muscles falling limp against the bed as Sherlock slips into the last knuckle, the back of his hand falling flush with his body. ""No. one... ever.. just you."" He tries to say, but Sherlock's tongue is circling the head of his cock, making John forget words, and how to breathe.



Sherlock rocks his finger slowly, cataloging everyone of John's reactions to each different movement. There was so much slick and he smelled so good it made Sherlock's head swim.




Focus, focus.




Sherlock looks up at John, his pupils blown dark as he slowly bobs his head to take John deeper into his mouth. Omega males usually had small cocks since they weren't exactly needed but Sherlock was still quite impressed with the side of John's. He loved the feeling of that hard velvet skin sliding into his mouth, the throbbing of John's cock over his tongue.



Sherlock pulls back just enough to kiss and suck on the tip as he slides a second finger into John's desperate leaking hole.



""For the love of God,"" John croaks, his hips rocking and bucking as if being controlled by someone else.



""If you don't fuck me while I'm still partially open, I swear to god I'm going to fall apart at the seams.""



Sherlock's fingers sink in deeper, the tips brushing over his prostate and he cries out in a broken sob.



""I swear, I can consent, I need this. I need to know what it's like to have an Alpha inside me. To have you inside me.""



Lifting his head from the pillow John looks down at Sherlock with pleading eyes.



""Please, Sherlock? Please, give this to me?""



Sherlock slowly pulls off John's cock, trying to think. He knew John was in the last grips of his heat. He knew there was still a possibility of getting John pregnant.



A strangled cry rips from John's throat at the loss of Sherlock's mouth on his cock.



He pushes himself up into a sitting position, dropping his legs from Sherlock's shoulders he gets on his knees and does the one thing he never thought he'd do.



He grabs Sherlock's face in both of his hands and begs.



""Please, Sherlock? I'll be a good Omega for you. It'll feel good, for both of us, I promise. Please?""



""I know, John. I know. Soon. I promise. I'll get the toys. I'll fuck you with the toys.."" Sherlock kisses John.



John growls in frustration and collapses back against the bed.



He watches, half angry, half turned on, as Sherlock slips from the bed and leaves the room without putting a stitch of clothing on.



When Sherlock returns, bag of toys in hand, John looks up from where he's curled up on his side and asks in a quiet voice, ""Why? Am I not good enough?""



""You're too good for me, John. That's why I won't risk screwing things up."" Sherlock says softly sitting on the bed and pulling toys out of the bag.



""Screwing what up?"" John's forehead wrinkles as he tries to catch up. ""What are you on about? How hard is it to shove a dick inside a wet hole?""



He eyes the toy Sherlock has selected and sighs. It's long and slim but has an inflatable alpha's knot around the base. He knows the type, having used them in the past.



It will do, but this time, he wanted the real thing, to feel Sherlock's warmth inside him would certainly be nothing like a cold and lifeless toy.



""I can still smell a bit of heat on you. Which means neither of us is thinking exactly clearly. It also means I could still get you pregnant.""



Pregnant The word crashes around John like a ton of bricks.



""Oh... shit... You're right, I wasn't thinking clearly. That hadn't even crossed my mind.""



John uncurls himself and sits up, wincing as his movement dragged slick across Sherlock's clean sheets.



""Thank you, Sherlock, for thinking of me.""



Shuffling on his knees he goes back to kneeling in front of Sherlock, this time resting his head on Sherlock's shoulder.



Looking up, he nudges his nose along Sherlock's jaw. ""Kiss me?""



Sherlock holds John close and kisses him gently. ""I would love to be inside you. Feeling your tight wet heat wrapped around my cock. But not yet. Soon."" He nuzzles him.



""Yeah, alright. I can wait."" John sighs, rubbing their noses together, then their cheeks.



He pulls away and lays back down, knees spread apart. But before Sherlock has time to move an idea comes to him.



""I can still have you inside me, just not... that way. Get over here,"" he pushes the pillows to the floor and wiggles a bit lower on the bed, ""Give me your cock while you fuck me. I can suck you off at the same time.""



Sherlock lets John situate him. ""I can suck you and fuck you with the toys as well."" He smirks.



""Oh, can you now?"" John grins, despite Sherlock not being able to see his face, and slides his hands from Sherlock's arse up his back as far as he can reach.



""Multi-task for me, pretty boy,"" he whispers, dragging his teeth across Sherlock's pale arse before dipping his head lower and sucking Sherlock's cock into his mouth.



At the same time, Sherlock's fingers re-enter him, drawing a half moan, half sigh from John's lips.



Wiggling his hips a bit, he angles his arse up and is rewarded by a spark of pleasure as Sherlock finds his prostate again.



Sherlock takes John's cock back into his mouth, sucking in time with his rocking fingers. Once he finds John's prostate he rubs it gently, continuing the motions that make John keen and tremble.



He picks up the dildo and warms it against his body first before rubbing the fat head against John's slick hole teasingly.



John's mouth is too full for him to properly complain. Instead, he growls and thrusts his hips up off the bed. The head slides across his hole then skitters over it.



Frustrated, he scrapes just the smallest amount of teeth down Sherlock's cock, and thrusts up into the wet heat of Sherlock's mouth. More, now please. He screams internally, his whole body vibrating with desire.



Sherlock chuckles around John's cock and starts to slide the dildo into his lover.



While not the real thing, it had been years since John had felt anything inside him. His whole body melts as the pleasure washed over him.



His movements become uncoordinated, his head coming to an almost complete standstill with Sherlock's cock still inside his mouth.



After several long seconds, when it becomes apparent that John either can't or won't move, Sherlock's hips begin to move.



With slow, but deep thrusts, Sherlock pushes himself, and the toy, inside John at the same time.



John feels full. Fuller than he's ever been before. That feeling, mixed with the still somehow coordinated movements of Sherlock's mouth, promising to bring him to a quick release.



Sherlock barely has the toy worked up to the knot when John begins to whimper, a poor communication to relay he was about to come, but the only thing he could think of.



Sherlock swallows around John's cock and presses the dildo deeper, pumping the knot steadily until it was stuck inside John. What John didn't know is that this model had a special attachment that also released fake cum.



Warmth floods John's insides as his climax takes over. His body twitches and shakes, but Sherlock's body weight holds him in place.



Something foreign and slick pulses inside his hole and with a muffled cry John comes hard against the back of Sherlock's throat.



He can feel Sherlock's knot, for the first time, begin to swell against his lips. John reaches up with one hand and wraps his fingers along the swollen knot, stroking it with his fingers as he rides out the last waves of his orgasm.



There's a growl from between his legs, and suddenly Sherlock's cock slips out of his mouth and lands on his chest with a wet squelch. Warm come oozes over John's chest and stomach, as the smell of Alpha finds a permanent place in his memories.



When he's done, he's thoroughly spent, and it's all he can do to wipe the back of his hand over his mouth, cleaning up saliva and pre-come from his chin.



Sherlock pants and takes a step back to catch his breath. He gently moves John into a more comfortable position on the bed, being careful of the dildo still locked in place. ""Alright?"" He nuzzles John, scenting him.



""Mmm,"" John manages, closing his eyes and letting Sherlock rub against the sides of his neck. His head rolls from side to side with the movements, but he's smiling lazily.



He clenches around the toy, imagining it was Sherlock rather than a dildo and nuzzles his nose against the side of Sherlock's head.



""You?""



""Quite alright."" Sherlock nods, sliding his fingers through his cum on John's chest. His inner alpha all but purring at the satisfaction of having his cum cover his mate.



""Mm, good,"" John says, closing his eyes and sighing.



""Don't want to wash it off..."" he sighs as Sherlock's finger traced circles in his come-covered skin. ""But I'm going to make a mess if I rollover. And.."" he wiggles his arse a bit, wincing as the toy shifts inside him and something slick shifts inside.



""Something tells me they'll be an even bigger mess when you pull that out.""



""My research indicated that the feeling of being filled with cum, even fake cum, helped with cramping as well as sexual craving. So I found a model that would help with that."" Sherlock hums. ""We could take you to the bath, that way any leaking would go down the drain when the dildo is released.""



""You just want to video me waddling to the bathroom with a cock up my arse."" John grins, cracking an eye open and drinking in the sight of Sherlock smiling down at him.



""Don't deny it. I know you want to.""



Sherlock chuckles and kisses John. ""It'll just give me more ideas for later if you have to waddle around with my cock inside you."" He smirks.



He gently bushes John's hair back. ""I'll carry you of course. Just don't make a habit of it. Can't let you get too domesticated of me. We still need that soldier edge for cases.""



John rolls his eyes, a gesture that is lost on Sherlock, who's already through the en-suit door to the bathroom. The sound of rushing water fills the room, and the scent of bath salts makes John shudder.



John tries to brush off Sherlock's offer, but strong arms scoop him up and carry him into the bathroom. He's gently placed in the tub. Warm water smelling of lavender and vanilla laps around his body.



Sherlock reaches an arm between John's legs and waits for John to nod. The knot is deflated, and the toy gently eased out of him.



John instantly misses the fullness. He whimpers slightly, but Sherlock is there, slipping into the water behind him.



His softening cock presses against the small of John's back as they lay there together in the warm.



When the tub threatens to overflow, John reaches up and turns the taps off with his feet.



""This is nice."" He sighs, nuzzling the back of his head against Sherlock's neck.



""I will admit I thought of joining you the other day in the bath,"" Sherlock says softly as he wraps his arms around John's midsection.



John laughs and shakes his head. ""I wanted to play with your hair... you sitting with your back against the tub. Those curls just... there.""



He places his hands over Sherlock's and relaxes into the embrace.



""I didn't want to like you. You were so arrogant, still can be. I felt like a science experiment, between having to pretend we were in a relationship down to the way you seem to look into my soul when you look at me.""



John's thumbs trace over the back of Sherlock's hands, the movement sluggish in the water.



""I thought any minute now, he's going to discover my secret. He's either going to pin me against a wall and bite me, or kick me out.""



""Instead, you surprised me, you showed your true colours. Showed me the kind man you try so hard to hide.""



Sherlock is quiet for a while. ""It's better if I'm brash and bold. It keeps people off-kilter. That way it's easier to see what's hidden when they're thrown and defensive. Why do you think Donovan always tugs her skirt down to cover her knees when she sees upcoming? Covering up is always more obvious than not."" He snorts.



He nuzzles John's hair, breathing in his scent. ""I.. I probably should have figured honestly but I was too caught up in being amazed that you actually decided to stay. I gave it three days, a week tops. But you stayed. You yelled back at me when I shouted at you. You made endless cups of tea. And helped me solve cases, catch bad guys. Saved my life."" He says softly, nosing behind John's ear.



""Course I stayed,"" John said as if that was answer enough.



""You gave me back a life full of adventure. After the army didn't want me anymore, I thought I was destined to have a life full of a forced bond, and a forced family.""



John subconsciously runs a hand over his stomach and shudders. ""Sherlock, how could I love my own children if they were forced on me. If I had no choice in having them? When I knew, if they presented as Omega's they'd be sold off after their first heat?""



He shakes his head firmly then sighs. ""You saved my life... There's a reason I held on to my service gun.""



Sherlock's arms tighten around John at the admission. ""You are your own person. You make your own choices. I'm just here to support you. Just like any couple."" He says softly.



""If we ever do have pups I won't allow them to be sold off. They'll stay with us until they go to university or whatever they choose. They'll be taught exactly the same. No difference between alpha or omega or beta. They'll each be given the same opportunities and support. We'll make sure they can defend themself no matter their secondary sex. I will not have our pups sold off like cattle.""



""I'd like that..."" John says then blinks, realizing how true his words were.



""Not now, but maybe in the future? Minds to teach, nurture, love? Almost sounds like a happy life.""



The water starts to get cold, but instead of getting out John leans forward and pulls the plug, letting some of the water drains out. Once half of it is gone, he puts the plug back in and turns the water back on.



Sherlock reaches for a bathbomb, and they watch as it fizzes and turns the tub a foamy blue.



""Did you ever think you could have that? A happy life?""



""Never,"" Sherlock says without hesitation. ""And then came you..""


John REALLY likes baths.

Mycroft steps in to make sure the legal side is taken care of...


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


It takes two more days for John to finally feel normal again. He wakes that morning to find Sherlock already dressed and pacing the lounge, his mobile pressed to his ear. 
Wrapping his dressing gown around him. John perks up his ears and listens to Sherlock's side of the conversation while turning the kettle on.



""No, Mycroft,"" and low growls are all John manages to hear. The conversation lasts until the kettle starts to boil, then Sherlock hangs up and lets out a frustrated growl. 



""Let me guess... he's sending a car to take us to the registry?"" John says while pulling two mugs out of the cabinet.



""Yes,"" Sherlock grumbles. ""And he wants us to go out to my parent's house for a bond contract signing party this weekend."" He presses against John's back in a strop, his lanky form heavy despite all his looks for malnourishment.



""Well, isn't that... nice?"" John says, then shakes his head. ""Nope, that doesn't sound right. That's not nice, that's torture. He's torturing us. Call him up and tell him to ship me back to Afghanistan. At least there the torture is expected."" John chuckles, and when Sherlock's chest vibrates against his and a low rumbling laugh fills his ears (then his groin) he nearly drops the tea kettle. The sound sends desire coursing through him like wildfire. 



""Well, we can make the car waiting, and we can file for an extension if we need to. That should give us time to draft our own contract. Plus, there won't be a bond until my next heat. Which could be months away."" John pushes down the pang of want with a regretful sigh.



""He's told Mummy."" Sherlock pouts. ""His mouth is as big as the rest of him. He only tells her things about my life so he doesn't have to tell her things about his. But he doesn't have a life. Just 'a small position in the government'."" He makes a gagging sound.



""I much prefer it when you gag on my cock."" John deadpans, making his mate hum in satisfaction. Shifting below Sherlock's weight to reach for the teabags before continuing, ""Then we go to your parents, and have the loudest sex we can imagine. Or just play a porno on full volume so they think it's us.""



""Why can't Mycroft just knock up some poor underling so mummy leaves me alone."" Sherlock gives a great big sigh.



John ignores Sherlock's strop. Instead, he turns around, nearly knocking over the steeping tea with his elbows and grins mischievously.



""Can I be a bossy arsehole to you in front of your parents? We can make them wonder if you've gone mad and have decided to attempt to bond with another Alpha.""



""Oh 

John

 you are a wonder."" Sherlock grins and kisses John deeply, pressing him back against the counter.



""That wasn't a no,"" John says in between kisses. ""You realize if you don't say no, I'm going to strut in there like I own the place.""

""Do it. My father will think it's hysterical."" Sherlock says with a laugh.



Placing his hands on Sherlock's hips he grins and leans up into the attention. For once, able to enjoy kissing without the pang of need pulling him down tho his most basic form.



""I don't care if the car is here now, I'm eating breakfast, and having a shower,"" John announces after a moment. Breaking from the seemingly endless waves of kisses he turns to place sugar in Sherlock's tea, and just milk in his.



""What breakfast food takes the longest to make?""



""A proper fry up. Eggs, bacon, sausage. The works."" Sherlock smirks, pulling the frying pan out and placing it on the cooktop. 



John manages to milk his time, making Mycroft's car wait nearly two full hours. When the clock announces it's just ten in the morning, he sighs and reaches for his coat.



""Shall we go sign my life away, figuratively speaking?""



""Mm, I suppose so. You could walk me around on a collar."" Sherlock wiggles his brows suggestively.



""As tempting as that is, let's not push our luck. Trying to draft our own contract is going to be uncommon enough as it is. I won't be surprised if they try and fight us on it. If we go in disrespectfully they'll deny any requests.""  John stops halfway down the stairs and smirks, ""But we can save the collar for your parents.""



Sherlock snorts. ""I suppose I'll keep you around."" He teases as he follows John downstairs. Climbing into the back of the car he started and rolled his eyes. Not expecting to see his brother waiting for them in the backseat. ""Mycroft."" He says cooly, as he sits. 



""Mind if we snog back here, Mycroft?"" John asks, climbing in and clambering over Sherlock so he sat between the two brothers. He turns his back to Mycroft, pressing his arse against the man's thighs, and grabs Sherlock's face with both hands.



Sherlock, who'd been reaching for the door to close it, stops halfway to the handle and freezes for a moment. Then, when John's lips meet his he melts and fills the back seat of the car with a low growl. His scent grows stronger and overwhelms the sour stench of Mycroft.



Smirking, John settles back and says, ""Better, now I can't smell his lemony arse.""



Sherlock snickers and holds John close to himself.



Mycroft rolls his eyes. ""Children.""



""If we're children, then what are you? A toddler in an overgrown suit?"" John snarks back, feeling Sherlock's chest heave as he suppresses his laughter. 
""Why are you even here? We're not signing anything today, just getting a draft form so we can come home and compose our contract.""



""As I am the elder brother I have legal responsibility for Sherlock and therefore you both need my signature for the registration. Sherlock's lucky he has me or else Mummy would have had to come down and do it."" Mycroft rolls his eyes.



""Ugh, you Alphas and your legal responsibilities. Always have to own someone,"" John groans, sticking out his tongue making a gagging motion with his finger. ""When will you learn that people are people? No matter what their bodies or parts look like?"" 
He rolls his eyes and resists the urge to let out a giant fart. Perhaps beans on toast hadn't been his smartest idea to have with breakfast.



""There's no point in having this conversation with you, though. Men like you think that men like me are trophies, who should find it their privilege to be owned and used. After all, isn't it our honour to provide Alphas like you children, to enrich your status in this world?""



""Mycroft likes to feel self-important because he hasn't caved to Mummy's begging to bond."" Sherlock hums.



""Dr. Watson, I have no care for what society thinks people are worth. I work within the confines of a crumbling system filled with idiots and imbeciles. If it made any difference to me the whole cast system would be done away with just to save me the paperwork. Do you know why this system was put into place? Omega's wanted legal protection and alphas wanted to perpetuate status, on that count you are correct. But omega's agreed to it because they were not allowed to work, to have jobs, to own land, or have any claim to their own offspring. Being married offered the opportunity to be bonded so someone who may care about them enough to give them the life they craved."" Mycroft sighs as he looks out the window.



""Your assumption however that only alphas benefit from this system is false. Secondary sex doesn't matter. Do you know that some of the largest sex trafficking, excuse me, I mean match-making services, are run by omega's because match-making is seen as feminine and omega work? They exercise the little bit of power they have over others of their kind. Before you talk to me as if you know every in and out of this system think of those who I have to work to protect from the deepest darkest rankest holes of our society. I care not whether you're an omega or beta or alien for all that matter. As long as my brother stays clean and alive that is all the concern I have."" Mycroft gets out of the car when they arrive at the office.



""Huh,"" John says, watching as Mycroft steps out. He turns to Sherlock and whispers, ""Who shoved a dildo up his arse."" 
However, even though his brief spat of snickers, he can't help but feel a tiny bit of respect towards Mycroft. His words, of course, were true. Ever Omega knew the rumors, knew about the trafficking. It was a ghost story told at night to scare Omega children into behaving. The big bad boogie man designed specifically for one gender. 
Still, John didn't let it upset him. They, unfortunately, were not his problem. Him, a lonely Omega, albeit military trained, wouldn't stand a chance against the world's biggest trafficking ring.



""Right... Let's get this over with then,"" he says, sobering up and stamping down his desire to snark Mycroft Holmes to death.



When they arrive at their destination he follows Mycroft into the building, Sherlock on his heels. Mycroft's presence alone grants them a private waiting room, where a young Omega, no older than nineteen, offers them food and drinks. When the three of them decline, the Omega departs and leaves them alone to wait.



""Let's get one thing clear,"" John says in a low and dangerous tone, ""If I'm signing anything today, I'm going to need to agree with every damned word written on that paper. No loopholes, no clauses, no surprises.""



""I've made it very clear that you have the same rights and sovereignty as my brother. You've both made that clean."" Mycroft nods. ""All we're signing today is that you're registering with my brother and intend to become his mate. That is all.""



""Mate..."" John sighs and rests his head up against the wall. He could go into a tirade about that word, but he knows it's just the stress of the situation putting him on edge.



Sensing his mood, Sherlock reaches out and places a hand on John's knee. The contact is enough to calm the worst of John's anxiety, though his knee still giggles up in down with restless energy.



""Just passing legal rights from the military to Sherlock,"" he says out loud to no one in particular. ""Probably not a terrible choice. At least this way if I get stabbed by a crazed lunatic on a case we don't have to wait for some General to come sign approval for medical aid.""



Sherlock rubs John's leg. ""It'll give you more rights as well.""



""Yes, you'll be able to go out after dusk without a chaperone."" Mycroft rolls his eyes.



""Never listened to that one,"" John admits with a shrug. ""But, I've done my best to pass for a Beta as often as I could.""



After a few more minutes laps by, a door opens and an older Alpha walks in carrying a manila file folder. He gestures to the party and leads them into a small office. There are only two chairs, but neither Sherlock nor Mycroft object when John claims one of the chairs as his own. 
John fights the urge to speak. While they are deciding his fate here today, he knows things will go a lot smoother for them if Sherlock explains their reason for being there.



""I'm here to register with my flatmate,"" Sherlock says.



The officiate nods and pulls a few pages out of the folder. John's leg starts bouncing again as the weight of the situation settles over him. Sherlock sits beside him, his fingers brushing against John's arm where it lays on the armrest.



""Before you ask,"" John says, the words heavy and greasy on his tongue. ""We're not bonding yet, we'll be waiting for my next heat. We're simply here to register, and transfer my legal rights from the military to Sherlock Holmes, the man I intend to be my Alpha.""



The official pulls out a sheet, an official registration form for both of them to sign as well as a witness. 
Sherlock reads it over and signs. 
John accepts the paper and reads over the wording carefully. To his relief, it's all straightforward, no hidden meanings, no fancy wording. Just straightforward legal terms transferring his rights to Sherlock. 
Gripping the pen far harder required, he signs his name, the nib pressing in hard, leaving an indent. On a separate form, he jots down the information of his CO, and is told that the office will take care of contacting the army on Sherlock's behalf.



Sherlock's nose twitches in annoyance, and in a cold voice, he corrects the man. ""Not on my behalf, but on John's.""



John preens a little bit, and puffs his chest out. 
They're stuck in the office for a while longer, having been asked to fill out a bonding plan, Which neither of them had given much thought to. Mycroft steps out of the room, giving John and Sherlock a few minutes of privacy as they discuss what they wished to write. In the end, they leave the form as vague as possible. Simple copying John's words from earlier, that upon his next heat, they intended to bond. 



""I believe we're finished here."" Mycroft drawls, having entered the room with the government official. He signs on the witness line, then hands the paper back for official recording. 



John stands first, and walks off out of the office without waiting for either Alpha with him to lead. 
He gets out to the car and breathes a sigh of relief. For the second time in his life John has just signed his rights away. But, for the first time, he wasn't dreading an invisible threat, one that loomed over him with every breath he took. 
Turning to Sherlock, when his Alpha catches up, he walks up to him and wraps his arms around Sherlock's back. ""Thank you, for what you said in there.""



Sherlock holds John close and scents him. ""I'm sorry he was an ass. Mycroft is ripping him a new arsehole."" He snorts softly.



""God, I loathe that the thought that I'll have to show him my bond bite."" John sighs and lets his Alpha mark him. Sherlock's scent soon washes away the other Alpha's scent and it makes him feel better. Helps ground him.



""Alphas just don't like seeing an unbound Omega..."" He glances over to the car, then looks up at Sherlock. ""What are the chances we can just get a cab home? Or we could walk? I want fresh air, and to see the city again. I've been cooped up inside for too long.""



""We can walk. Mycroft will have copies sent to the flat."" Sherlock takes John's hand, leading him away from the building.


Poor John :( Having to give up his basic rights. Breaks my heart a little. -Tindo

Sherlock and John take on a case just before bonding... Will they survive the tension?


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


Two months later Sherlock a letter from the gardener who tended to his great grandmother's estate shows up on their front door Hand-delivered by a courier, who stood and waited for Sherlock to read it and give his response. Sherlock's grandmother had some of the most awarded gardens in the French countryside. Not only that but she had several colonies of bees that supported her garden and the local vineyards. Currently, both were being threatened. 



""John! We have to go to France! Start packing!"" Sherlock says from the living room as he reads the letter. Someone had been poisoning his great-grandmother's garden and the bees were dying in droves. Worse yet, it didn't seem to be limited to just his grandmother's hives and property. Before consulting John, 
Sherlock buys them first-class flights for that night.  The sooner he and John get to his grandmother's the sooner they could start working on the case. With any luck, no later than tomorrow morning. would be able to settle in and get working on the case first thing in the morning. 



After two days of investigating it becomes apparent that it wasn't only his great grandmother's garden that was being terrorized but the surrounding vineyards as well all at the expense of the local pollinators. If there was one way to piss off Sherlock Holmes it was the senseless murder of bees. Sherlock
 sits at the breakfast table on the morning of the second day, watching John eat as he goes over the facts of the case.



""We've ruled out rival vineyards and local exterminators."" He grumbles, irritated.



""How are the bees dying?"" John asks, trying to shake to sleep from his groggy mind. ""They're dying because their source of food is poisoned, right?""



Sherlock nods once and growls.



""How easy is it to produce the poison they're using? Need they be a chemist, or can your local run-of-the-mill druggy who's good at mixing make it?""  Unsued to seeing Sherlock apply emotion to his cases, he's tempted to remind Sherlock to keep a level head. However, despite the angry growling and fretful hairpulling, he finds Sherlock's emotional side endearing.  Plus, t
here's something about the fire in Sherlock's eyes that makes John want to pull off every stitch of his clothing and kiss him better.



""Bees are delicate. Any run-of-the-mill pesticide can cause mass die-offs. That's why this is so frustrating. There are still too many variables."" Sherlock grumbles and crosses his arms. ""We'll have to go back to the vineyards and investigate again. I'll have to look closer at the hives.""



""Alright, but I'm finishing my damned breakfast first,"" John says, pointing his fork across the table at his Alpha.



Sherlock just rolls his eyes but doesn't tell him to hurry up. 
An hour later they're well on their way to the nearest vineyard. The overcast sky adds a gloomy feeling to the day. John finds himself focusing on Sherlock's scent in their rented car. 
The rental company did a good enough job of erasing the scent of the Alpha who drove it last, but pungent notes of stale seawater still find their way into John's nostrils.



""Give me your scarf?"" He asks, his stomach rolling. ""God he smells like low tide and rotting sea creatures.""



Sherlock takes off his scarf and hands it to John before unrolling the windows as he drove. ""Smells like they drove this thing off a pier and dragged it out six months later.""



They finally arrive at the nearest vineyard. Going through the building they wave at the manager who waves them to the back where the rows and rows of grapes were.



Sherlock walks between the rows, inspecting them. Then he goes to the hives. Out of the original five, only one and a half were barely hanging on. He couldn't see any damage to the hives themselves but there was a stain in the dirt.



Pressing Sherlock's scarf to his nose John silently follows Sherlock. He doesn't know what to look for but stays alert. 
Standing back, mostly to give Sherlock space, he paces a wide circle around the hives, listening to Sherlock call out facts. 
On his third loop around the hives a spot of yellow catches his eyes. Taking a handkerchief out of his pockets he bends down and lifts up a small yellow pin.



Only a little bit bigger than a large button, the pin is simple. It has a yellow background and ""Free the bees'' written in black ink. Though, to his puzzlement, there's a circle with a red dash drawn with what appears to be a marker.



""Sherlock,"" he calls, taking care not to touch the pin. ""I might have found something.""



Sherlock goes to John immediately. ""Save the bees?"" He sounds confused. ""Why cross it out?""



""Mmm..."" John mumbles, sniffing the air as Sherlock gets close. ""You smell nice.""



He passes the pin over, then steps into Sherlock's space and begins nuzzling his face along Sherlock's chest, sticking his nose deep into Sherlock's armpit where his scent is stronger. 
""I missed you, when you were over there. That's silly, isn't it? I could still see you."" 



Sherlock wraps his arm around John as he looks at the pin. ""Grandmama's house smells old and musty, not like Baker Street that's saturated in us."" He kisses John's head. ""We need to talk to the manager and see if they know about the pin.""



John whimpers when Sherlock pulls away. His chest feels warm from their contact, though it quickly grows cold as Sherlock walks away, putting distance between them. 
With a small growl, he chases after his Alpha and catches up to him, breathing a sigh of relief to have Sherlock and his comforting scent back by his side.



""Think the managers in on this? Or are you just hoping he'll recognize the pin?'



""Possibly. Let's see if we can jog his memory. He told us that no one is allowed on the grounds that doesn't come through the building and they have electric fencing but there are show prints in the dirt that don't match the workers boots."" Sherlock wraps his arm around John's waist and keeps him close. 
""Marco!"" Sherlock calls out. ""Have you seen this before?"" He asks the manager when he comes over, showing him the pin.



As John listens to the two men talk he becomes aware of a new feeling settling in the pit of his stomach. 
Doing his best to both pay attention to Sherlock and the manager Marco, he almost doesn't realize it for what it is. 
Desire. Not just the normal desire he'd grown accustomed to over the past few months of their relationship, but a deep seeded desire he could feel all the way down to his toes.  
He wanted to claim Sherlock, he wanted to lick every scent gland and mark Sherlock as his. He wanted to come in his hand and smear his come over Sherlock's skin so every unbound Omega that passed Sherlock would know he was taken. 
He begins humming the tune to Billy Idol's Cradle of Love. The words echoing throughout his mind, and seeming to vibrate across his soul.




Yeah flesh for your romeo



Ah yeah baby



I hear you moan



It's easy, y'know how to, please me yeah




Sherlock gives him a scathing look, but when their eyes meet understanding flashes between them.



""As you can see,"" Sherlock says to Marco while still looking at John, ""John's heat is...he's going to be very heated,"" he corrects himself, ""if we don't find these men.""



""Yeah, I only start humming 90's rock music when I'm angry,"" John says, doing his best to keep a straight face, which isn't easy when Sherlock looks like he wants to find the nearest dark nook and tear John's clothes off.



However, Sherlock is drawn back to the case when Marco tells them about a group of young hippies who came by a few weeks ago. He kicked them out because they smelled like weed, (bad for a reputable business) and they kept asking if the wine the vineyard produced was with slave labor. He told them of course it wasn't and that they needed to leave because they were causing a scene.



""Slave labor."" Sherlock mumbles curiously.



""Tell me you can solve this quickly,"" John hisses as they walk away, ""I estimate we have a day and a half two at most, before my biology kicks in.""



""We'll go back to the estate and I'll make a list of vineyards that haven't been hit who boast about their own hives. We'll have a stakeout at the most likely one and finish this tonight. Hopefully."" Sherlock nods.



John nods once and grimaces as he nears the car. ""God, what did he do? Have sex in the backseat?""



Sherlock opens his mouth, about to answer but John sticks his finger out and says, ""No. Nope I don't actually want to know.""



The ride back to Sherlock's family estate is quiet. Sherlock thinks while he's driving, which John can't imagine is safe, but without a license there's little he can do. 
When they pull up the gravel drive he says softly, half stating, half still expecting he needs Sherlock's permission. ""Think I can get my license? When we get back to London?""



""Of course, John. It'll be much more practical for you to drive so I can think. I'm surprised the military didn't let you get one. Probably didn't want you running away with all your newfound freedoms."" Sherlock rolls his eyes and gets out of the car.



""Oh I could drive. Military status trumps everything else. I've driven tanks, trucks, hummers... Even had a funny little golf cart to get around on base. But in the civilian world I need that pesky little licence.""



The car comes to a stop and John is more than happy to step into the fresh air. The late afternoon sun feels warm on his face and he sighs. ""Should have realized this was coming. Remember on the plane I said I could smell someone chewing gum? My senses are working overtime. I bet, if a bound Omega who isn't on the cusp of their heat, got close to the car all they'd smell is chemicals.""



""It's a month early. I thought we'd have time for this case. I'm sorry."" Sherlock says softly, feeling awful that he's dragged John to another country to solve a case and now he's going into heat away from their home.



""Yeah well, my system is out of whack,"" John falls into step behind Sherlock as they head into the large house.



""Kitchen?"" He asks thinking that he can make an early dinner while Sherlock works out which vineyards need their surveillance.



""I should have accounted for that."" Sherlock sighs. ""Yes you should eat.""



""So should you. We won't be eating much in a few days. We'll both need as many calories now as we can manage.""



John doesn't leave room for Sherlock to argue. He quickly sets about making dinner, opting to cook a frozen pizza over something from scratch. 
While waiting for the oven to preheat he begins going over a mental list of everything they'd need if he was going to have his heat here.  
Taking stock of the fridge and its contents he begins a list.




Water bottles



Cheese



Fruits



Nuts


Cured meats



Once he gets a list started it flows easily and it's taking up a full page in his notebook. Figuring he'd gotten the gist of it he pockets the notebook and turns to Sherlock.



""You said vineyards, plural. Makes sense if I take one, you take the other.""



""Logically yes it makes sense but you're also going into heat and I'm not sure I'm comfortable leaving you on your own."" Sherlock frowns, looking up which vineyards are most likely to be targeted next. 



""I have my gun,"" John shrugs as he puts the pizza into the oven. ""Wouldn't be the first risky situation I've been in.""



""Yes I know that but I'm also supposed to have your back,"" Sherlock mumbles as he presses against John's back, breathing him in.



""Mm, but I'm a big boy,"" John says, leaving back into Sherlock and resting his head against Sherlock's shoulder.



""If we want this over tonight we should split up. What's the distance between them? Can we stay in touch through walkie talkies?""



""The properties are neighboring but the hives are on opposite ends."" Sherlock wraps his arms around John, scenting him.



""I suppose we could. When we see something suspicious we could alert the other to come over for back up."" He says, still not liking the idea of leaving John.



""Relax, Sherlock,"" John says, turning around and falling into his Alpha's embrace. ""We've done this loads of times. I dare say London is a bit more dangerous than a field full of grapes after nightfall.""



Preening under Sherlock's attention, he forgets to set a timer for the pizza. Eventually, Sherlock pulls his lips away from John's neck and whispers in his ear, 
""Ding."" It sends shivers down John's spine, but he manages to pull away and reach for the potholders. 

Sherlock watches John take the pizza out and cut it into slices. ""Fine but the minute you don't feel right or you see something you tell me.""



""Superpower, remember?"" He says, pointing to his nose once the hot pan is placed on the kitchen surface. ""I'll be able to smell trouble coming at me, and can have you by my side in no time.""



Unable to find a pizza cutter, John takes a large knife and cuts the pizza, grinning as he says, ""Hell hath no fury like an Alpha's whose unbound mate is about to start his heat.""



""Exactly,"" Sherlock smirks, impressed with John's cutting skills. ""I don't think that should be as arousing as it is.""



""Good, then have a slice.""


Here we goooooo tomorrow's update starts a fun story plot!

The boys stakeout to see who's been killing the bees...


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


They wait until dusk has settled around them before they leave. John double checks, then triple checks his gun, before sliding it into a holster he has under his jacket. 
When Sherlock cocks an eyebrow at him, as if asking where on earth the holster had come from, John just shrugs.



""I like to be prepared. Should have seen Mycroft's men scrambling to get my gun on the plane. I nearly peed myself laughing. I figured, if I was going through the trouble to get this on board, I'd bring my full kit.""



""I need to stop looking at you so closely. Everything you do turns me on."" Sherlock licks his lips as he looks John over. ""You accounted for the time change and took your contraceptive, correct?""



""Mm."" John nods while turning the volume on his mobile phone to vibrate only ""Had to change the alarm on my mobile, but I've been careful. As long as you somehow get me to take it during my heat, there shouldn't be any major surprises in a few months.""



""I'll drug you for your own good."" Sherlock chuckles, making sure he has his tools of the trade.



""Wouldn't be the first time you've drugged me... But for my own good?"" Laughing John slides into the car and groans as the scent of past drivers assaults his senses.



""So. Just to recap,"" he says, buckling himself in, ""Hide, watch the hives. Alert you to anything suspicious. Keep my distance, and do not engage. I'll stand upwind of the hive, in case any of them are Alphas. Which should also aid me in



scenting them first, as long as they don't approach me from behind."" 
John pulls two walkie-talkies out of a bag by his feet and checks their batteries. 
""Only use these for emergencies, keep the volume low, and try not to check in just to ask me how I'm doing. We have our designated check-in times, once an hour on the hour. If either of us is a minute late checking in, we call the local police.""



""I love a military man."" Sherlock groans happily as he drives.



""Now who's the sex-happy one in this relationship."" John chuckles and can't deny that he's thoroughly enjoying the slightly glazed look in Sherlock's eyes.



Sherlock drops John off along the edge of one of the vineyards, as close to the hives as the car can go. 
John climbs out, then walks around to Sherlock's door. He motions for Sherlock to lower the window, then leans in.



""Be safe, yeah?""



""You, too."" Sherlock pulls John in and kisses him before scenting him liberally. ""Don't do anything stupid. I'm just a call away.""



""Out of the two of us,"" John says, smirking and pulling away, but keeping his head low enough that he can see into the car, ""Who's more likely to do something stupid?""



Sherlock looks like he wants to argue and then shuts his mouth with a click. ""I have nothing to say on this matter."" He pouts.



""That's what I thought."" John laughs softly, then taps the roof of the car. ""Get going, you. Pick me up around 1. I'm not sitting out here all night."" 
He slings the duffel bag over his shoulder and turns without another word. Dressed in black, his slight frame disappears into the vines almost instantly.



Sherlock watches John go until he's out of sight and then heads to his hiding spot. At nearly midnight Sherlock hears footsteps, at least three people. He gets in position, wanting to catch them in the act. 
The evening passes slowly. Dark settles around John and the damp that comes with it. 
He keeps his gun tucked inside his jacket, resting the urge to feel its comforting weight in his hands.



It's probably just kids... he reminds himself. To pass the time he circles the hive every twenty minutes. Making sure to keep his feet silent, while staying alert for anyone or anything. 
He startles a rabbit, but other than that nothing happens. Until midnight.



He was just about to pull out the walkie-talkie to contact Sherlock for their hourly check-in, when two bobbing circles of light break through the evening just south of his position. 
Two minutes earlier than their agreed check-in time, he whispers into the radio



""Two lights, just out of earshot, over.""



He slides his gun out of the holster and flicks off the safety. John Watson, the person, might not be in any real danger, but John Watson the Omega close to his first natural heat in years... might be.



""Shit."" Sherlock stills as all three heads whip around to his direction, John's voice was quiet but they still heard something.  
One of them moves closer and Sherlock decides since his cover is blown he might as well use whatever little surprise he has left. He jumps out and knocks out the one closest to him.



""What the fuck!"" Yelps one of the others. Sherlock goes after him next, his radio clatters to the ground in the struggle with the button pushed down by a rock.



""Bastard!"" The third growled and picked up a plank of wood, cracking Sherlock over the head. The sound was sickening and Sherlock could feel his scalp split. He managed to knock out the second with blood in his eyes before the third could land another blow.



Wiping blood out of his face he could see the shirt the third was wearing. ""Free the bees? What does that even mean? They are free."" He growls as they circle each other.



""They are not! Trapped in those boxes and worked like slaves! All their honey is taken and they're left to starve!"" He shouts back.



Sherlock stops, maybe it was the concussion or the blood loss. ""Do you not know how beekeeping works?"" He says, sounding utterly confused.



""THAT'S just a fancy name for slave master!"" The third snaps back.



""Oh for Christ's sake."" Sherlock rubs a hand over his face. ""You're a bunch of animal rights activist idiots who don't even under animal husbandry."" He sighs.



John's blood goes cold at the sounds coming from his radio. Voices had crackled through the speaker, voices that did not belong to Sherlock. 
Then there had been the unmistakable sound of Sherlock in pain before the device went completely silent. 
John knows better than to waste time calling Sherlock's name. Stuffing the radio into his pocket he withdraws his mobile phone and dials the local police, pleased with himself for putting the number in his contacts before they'd left the estate. 
He relays what's going on in hushed tones, backing up so the people getting closer to him will have less opportunity to hear him. 
Once he's done calmly relaying the information over to the dispatcher, he shoves his mobile into his back pocket and runs a hand through his hair, tugging at the ends.



Think Watson he tells himself, willing the pang of panic to go away. I didn't hear a gunshot, didn't hear a vehicle... But that was Sherlock's voice crying out in pain, I'm sure of it.



He cursed himself, wishing they were bonded so he could have a better sense of if Sherlock was alright. 
Realizing that the lights had grown close enough that he could make out dim shapes moving towards him, he raises his lips in a snarl and stalks forward, gun in hand. 
He takes them both by surprise, tackling one, a young beta woman to the ground. Without muttering an apology he slams the butt of the gun into the back of her head hard enough to knock her out, then turns the gun on the other, a young alpha barely old enough to need to shave.



""Sit. Hands on your head,"" he snarls, placing one foot on the throat of the young woman. ""Or I'll crush her windpipe."" 
He has no intention of doing such a thing, but what the Alpha didn't know, wouldn't hurt him.



Sherlock grumbles as he ties the three idiots together and makes sure they can't get away. He picks up the walkie and finds that it's crushed. John! His mind screams. If John had been calling for help he wouldn't have been able to hear it. 
Before Sherlock knows it he's sprinting through the vineyard towards where he left John. His head is pounding and his vision is a little blurred, running mostly on his instincts alone. 
Panic wraps around the base of John's skull, cold and slippery. Worried about his Alpha's fate, he almost misses the flick of anger in the young Alpha's eyes when he realizes he's being held at gunpoint by an Omega. 
Channeling all of his anxiety into anger, John pulls the hammer back and cocks his head.



""Oh, I wouldn't move if I were you. I bet you that my bullet can move faster than you. Is that a bet you're willing to lose?""



The alpha growls something rude, but his string of derogatory remarks falls of deaf ears as John escapes into his mind where he's instantly welcomed by his own fear, wondering what happened to Sherlock. 
Sirens carry across the wind. And while they're still far away, it reassures John that soon he'll be able to go and find Sherlock. 
As they grow nearer, his stomach clenches, the first waves of craps rearing their ugly head.



Sherlock nearly trips through the clearing. ""John!"" He nearly tackles his omega, checking him over to any injuries. ""Are you alright? Are you hurt? Did they touch you? Are you okay?"" He rattles off questions, not seeing any injuries on John and he doesn't smell hurt.



John struggles to maintain his balance, and his gun arm, while Sherlock feels him up.  
He lets his Alpha check him over, knowing that Sherlock needs it as much as he does. He doesn't dare take his eyes off the young Alpha, but he sees something dark and shiny in the moonlight on the side of Sherlock's face and he can smell blood.



""Fine, love,"" John says softly, his foot slipping and pressing down a little too hard into the beta's throat. He corrects himself, and winces, knowing she'll have a foot-shaped bruise in the morning.



""If you don't mind though, I'm crushing this poor girl's throat. Mind getting the cuffs out of my back and taking care of this young prick while I make sure I haven't crushed her windpipe."" 
He risks one quick glance at Sherlock and growls, ""Then I'll be taking a look at you.""



Sherlock nods and gets the cuffs for the young alpha. He forces him down face-first into the dirt when he tries the struggle. ""This will hurt you way more than it will hurt me. I'm concussed, bleeding, and you threatened my omega. I could kill you and no jury would convict me."" He hisses.



John feels his face heat at Sherlock's words. He nearly forgets why he was bent over the female beta as a desire to tackle Sherlock to the ground and have him then and there threatens to override his logical side. 
Down, Lizard brain he tells himself, quickly walking Sherlock through the events as the sirens got close enough that their blue flashing lights cast strange shadows over the vineyard. 
The beta shows no sign of waking, so John motions to Sherlock once he's done fighting with the struggling man, and points to the ground.



""Sit."" He says, not caring one once if Sherlock's posh trousers get ruined by dirt. When Sherlock is sat on the ground he kneels in front of him and pulls his mobile out of his pocket.



Using the flashlight app, he holds the light up to Sherlock's face. He checks Sherlock's eyes for response time, and makes a satisfied grunt, then tilts Sherlock's head to the side. 
There's a large bump, and in the center a small split where something blunt had made contact with Sherlock's temple. Digging through his bag he pulls out a small medical kit and a water bottle. 
By the time he's done cleaning the wound, voices can be heard making their way towards them.



""Not deep, won't need stitches,"" John says softly, dabbing some ointment on the gash. ""But I'll need to clean and bandage it properly once we're back. I need more light to make sure I've gotten any foreign material out of the wound.""



""Alright."" Sherlock nods and stands as the police approach them. He tells them the owners had hired him and John against vandals and details what happened. He tells them where to find the others who should all still be tied together.



After explaining again and again and finally signing statements they're freed to go. ""You want to drive or me?"" Sherlock asks when they get back to the car.



""No way in hell I'm letting you drive,"" John says, holding out his hand for the keys.



""That's what I thought."" Sherlock passes over the keys. ""Don't go too fast. I may vomit.""



""Then you can vomit out the window, please, and thank you,"" John says, tossing his bag into the back seat and sliding in behind the wheel. 
Thinking fast, he gets out again, reaches into the backseat and dumps the contents of his bag on the floor, then passes Sherlock the bag.



""Better than nothing,"" he says softly as he got back in and started the car. 

Taking care to avoid the worst of the ruts in the dirt road out of the vineyard, he pulls out onto the main road.  
He drives a little faster than the speed limit, but slows down around corners, keeping his eye on Sherlock the whole time.  
When Sherlock starts to nod off, he reaches over with one hand and shakes his shoulder.



""Nope, no sleeping. Not until I have a proper look at you. Stay awake for me, Sherlock.""



Sherlock grumbles and does his best to stay awake. ""I was worried..""



""And you think I wasn't?"" John snaps back, then sighs, ""I'm not mad at you. Mad at them, for making me think something had happened to you. Sod the bees, sod their movement... All I care about is you. If something had happened..."" 
He trails off, unwilling to let himself finish that thought.



""Apparently I'm extremely hard-headed."" Sherlock says softly and rests his hand on John's thigh.



""Git,"" John says fondly, taking his hand off the gearshift for a moment to squeeze Sherlock's hand. 
""Scaring me into an early heat... I swear you did it on purpose.""



""I would have rather had more time to gather supplies and not have a head wound."" Sherlock snorts. ""How are you feeling?""



""Fine..."" John says even as a wave of cramps makes him wince. ""I've probably got twelve hours or so... long enough for us to catch a nap, then I can send you off to the shops.""



The estate looms in the distance and John breathes a sigh of relief when the gate automatically closes behind them. 
He pulls the car right up to the door and turns it off. 
He leaves everything in the car, except his gun, then heads over to Sherlock's side and offers to help him inside. 
Sherlock lets John lead him to the bathroom where the lights were the brightest so John can inspect his head. ""It was a piece of wood."" He says, knowing John's thinking what hit him.



""Mm, I'll check it for splinters,"" John says as he gets what he needs. He washes his hands, then puts gloves on. ""Tilt your head to the light for me?""



John takes his time, picking out small pieces of dirt and wood, then washing the wound clean.



""It really isn't as bad as it looks."" He says happily, putting more ointment on it and gliding his finger along the undamaged skin below the wound.



""I can bandage it if you'd like, but it's an awkward place, and the bandage will probably just slide off while you sleep. As long as we keep it clean, and watch it for infection, I think it's alright like this. But, your call.""



""It's fine. We'll just leave it. It's stopped bleeding so that's a plus."" Sherlock hums, liking the feeling of John taking care of him. He rests his hands on John's hips and presses his face to John's chest, breathing him in.



""Off to bed with you, then... I don't think there's much risk of a seizure, but I'll stay up for a little while and watch you.""



Sherlock starts to complain but John cuts him off with a shake of his head.



""Sherlock, I'm going to need you rested tomorrow, and fed. I don't think you understand how bloody exhausting it is to have sex for two or more days in a row. Non fucking stop. If you think your body hurts now, from that crack on your head... god you're in for something else.""



""Fine."" Sherlock sighs and starts to strip off his dirty bloody clothes. ""Only because you asked so nicely."" He teases.



""Humph,"" John grunts, shooing Sherlock out of the bathroom with a smile.



He slips into the kitchen and gets a glass of water, then detours back into the bathroom where he pops two painkillers out of their packaging.



""You'll be taking these, while I take my no have babies pill,"" he says, passing the tablets and the water over to Sherlock, who was in bed, though he was sitting up.



Sherlock swallows the pain medicine John hands him. ""Hopefully they kick in soon. I have a splitting headache."" He jokes.



""Ha.. ha.."" John says in a monotone. ""If I had a quid for every time someone said that to me, we could retire on our own private island.""



Still he smiles, and sits on the edge of the bed, brushing a few stray curls from Sherlock's forehead. While his intention is mainly of comfort, he can't help but watch Sherlock's eyes for any sign of something worse happening.



However, the pupils don't dilate, and his gaze remains clear and focused. After a few moments, John leans over and flicks off the lamp.



""I'll be back in a few... Need a shower."" He says, leaning forward and pressing a kiss to Sherlock's uninjured forehead.



Sherlock hums softly, leaning into the contact. He's still holding on to John when John tries to pull away.



""Oi, Alpha..."" John sighs, leaning over Sherlock and nuzzling their noses together. ""Let me go so I don't stink like Seawater Alpha and that young pup when you finally bond me.""



Sherlock makes a face and finally lets John go. ""Infantile little shit he was. Surprised he knew where to find his cock let alone use it."" He grumbles.



""I mean, he was with a beta..."" John calls as he finally breaks free of Sherlock's grip and heads back into the bathroom. 
""You can't tell me you didn't smell his spunk all over her?"" 
John leaves the door open and he begins to strip out of his dirty clothes. 
""Might know how to use it, but not well enough to please an Omega.""



A soft chuckle reaches John's ears. It creates a pool of desire deep within John and he wonders if his estimate of twelve hours was correct.



""What are the chances we can get some supplies dropped off? I already have a list."" He asks loudly as he steps into the shower.



""I'll have someone deliver whatever we need. I'm not leaving you again."" Sherlock settles against the pillows.



John showers quickly, but takes care to wash every inch of his body, washing off all forging scents.


Hey guys, Important note so please give this one a read

Accident and I updated the tags to reflect on future chatpers. There will be some non-con mentioned (thoughthe acts will never be described) We completely understand that non-con is tough for people, so we REALLY wanted to give everyone a warning.

You can always find me on twitter (https://twitter.com/Tindo_on_AO3) and ask me to let you know when the chapter that mentions Noncon pops up, and when its over. I will be happy to fill you in on the cliff notes. 

please go ahead and give the new tags a read just so you are aware. I'll to be better at editing them as well!

Finally a bond....


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


When he steps out his skin is a blank template, ready to be scented by his Alpha until their bodies absorb each other's unique scents. 
He finds Sherlock still awake, his notebook laying open on the table beside his phone. Smiling, knowing that their needs will be delivered in the morning, John climbs into bed beside Sherlock.



""Hey..."" he asks after a moment when Sherlock turns into him and inhales deeply. ""What do I smell like, to you? You're all.. posh things, like leather and rich scents. Caramel sometimes, especially when you're angry. Other times, when you're just laying on the sofa in your mind palace you smell like vanilla. Do.. do I smell good?""



Sherlock smiles softly and leans in, smelling over John's neck and chest. ""Mm when I wake you early for a case or in the middle of the night you smell annoyed, a sour lime type smell but also a little sweet because you know a case is on. When you're having a bad day or your shoulder hurts you smell like gun oil and cold wind."" He mumbles, pressing kisses to John's skin. 
""When you're happy or I've complimented you it's like freshly baked cinnamon rolls dripping with glaze. And when you're turned on by something I've said or done. It's juicy and meaty. Something I want to sink my teeth into."" He murmurs as he kisses John's neck. ""There's always a base of warm stone as an undercurrent, strong and reliable. 
So yes, in short, you smell very good."" Sherlock licks johns scent gland teasingly



John shivers and his breath ghosts over Sherlock's face. 
""I want you to... to sink your teeth into me. I want you to make me yours, and you mine. I want to feel you through our bond, a constant reminder that we have each other, no matter what comes our way."" 
John points to a spot on the right side of his neck, just above one of his scent glands. ""Here, where it will show above my collar, so everyone can see it. ""



""Mm who knew my omega was an exhibitionist,"" Sherlock smirks, licking and sucking on the spot John points out.



""Public sex is great, don't knock it until you've tried it."" John half says half moans, then in a more alert tone adds, 
""At one pm I need to take my pill, remind me tomorrow Sherlock. I have an alarm set on my mobile, but I think it's still in my coat pocket... and I don't remember where I threw my coat when we came in.""



""I'll remind you,"" Sherlock mumbles as he kisses John's neck.



""We'll need..."" John continues, trying his hardest to think through the overwhelming presence of Sherlock, ""breakfast. Something full of calories and protein without being too heavy. Eggs, with cheese or something, and lots of liquids. When your knot swells in me... stay with me. Just hold me through it. It won't hurt me as long as you don't pull out before it naturally goes down.""



Sherlock hums something and noses his way to the other side of John's neck, licking along the scar tissue on his shoulder.



""You're distracting me... You might have a headache in the morning, but..."" he flushes a brilliant shade of red and says hoarsely, ""my slick can cure it. It's designed to help an alpha heal, in case of injuries before a heat.""



""Isn't that convenient?"" Sherlock mumbles, pressing John into the bed as he licks his neck and chest, pressing his nose to his armpits.



""Is... is there anything else I'm forgetting?"" John says while gasping for breath. Sherlock's hair tickles his chest, his tongue is warm and wet as he glides over his body. 
Though not fully in the throws of his heat, his cock is hard and he doesn't need to look down to know that Sherlock's is as well.



""Mm heating pad for cramps,"" Sherlock mumbles as he licks John's nipple.



""I shouldn't need it. Not as long as you're here and willing to fuck me."" 
John winces as a cramp yanks the words out of his mouth. ""Oh... you mean for now... right.""



Sherlock nods and moves lower, kissing John's stomach. ""Let me get you a hot water bottle. The order should be here in the next hour or so.""



""Alright."" John nods and lets his hands slide from Sherlock's back. 
The bed seems empty without his Alpha, and he finds himself wanting to cry until Sherlock's footsteps head back towards the bedroom. 
John lifts his head and sighs at the sight as Sherlock comes back to him. 
Tall, pale, eyes flashing with lust, and his powers of deduction are focused on him, and him alone. 
Sherlock is like a statue of marble. Beautiful, elegant while at the same time hard and unmoving. 
John's heart raced at the knowledge that against all odds Sherlock was here with him now, willing to entwine their lives together in a way that couldn't naturally be broken.



""When I said twelve hours..."" John whispers, ""I might have been exaggerating.""



""I think I'm more than partially to blame for that."" Sherlock rests the warm water bottle on John's stomach and cuddles him.



""Good, then *you* can do something about it as soon as my body starts producing lube. Until then, get some sleep. We're going to need it.""



Sherlock nods and pulls John to his body, cocooning them in their blankets. He scents John, covering John in his scent. 
Once John would have thought it impossible to fall asleep while every inch of his body was being nosed and kicked at. But his body knew what was coming, and it knew he needed rest. 
He drifted off with Sherlock's nose brushing against his side around two am. He doesn't wake until the sun is well up. Opening his eyes he groans and attempts to sit up. But something heavy is holding him down.



""Oi... Need the loo."" He croaks, wondering if Sherlock got any sleep at all, or if he'd been up all night scenting him. But a glance at Sherlock shows half of his curls matted down and sleep lines on his face from the pillow.



""Loo, then food first,"" he says softly, doing his best to ignore how badly his body demanded he simply spread his legs and beg for it. 
He takes care of his physical needs quickly, opting for cold pizza rather than warm eggs and toast. He even takes the slice of pizza to bed with him, the thought of not being by Sherlock's side suddenly unthinkable. 
When the pizza is gone he starts to lick his fingers and looks over at Sherlock, ""I think it's time, don't you?""



Sherlock nods, pulling John back to him again. ""How would you like to do this?"" He nuzzles John, running his nose along John's.



""Your cock inside me should be fine."" John quips. ""Wouldn't you agree?""



""Really? Is that how it works?"" Sherlock snorts, running his hand over John's side.



""Usually, yes,"" John says with a laugh. He appreciates Sherlock's uncertainty. This is new for both of them, and while he isn't afraid of messing things up with Sherlock it is still a bit awkward. 
""Why don't we just... Kiss? I want you to embrace being an Alpha. Enjoy this, because my heats are the only time you'll be hearing me beg for you to fill me up.""



John lays flat on his back and pulls Sherlock on too of him. Sherlock's cock sits heavy against his thigh as he drags his hands down Sherlock's back. 
They kiss, slow and soft at first. Each of them testing the waters of this new situation. It's different this time, knowing that they'd come out the other side as a bonded pair. 
Slowly the kisses turn into rough love nips, Sherlock's canine teeth descend and scrape along John's jaw, across his neck. He sucks at John's pulse point, just beside where John said he wanted his bite



""Wait to bite me until you've knotted me. I hear it won't hurt me if you do it then.""



Sherlock nods, sucking gently on John's scent gland and snaking his hand down, reaching down to feel at John's slick.



""Oh god!"" John cries out when Sherlock's fingers slide over his hole. Sherlock chuckles softly, his voice coming out like melted chocolate. Rich and smooth.



Sherlock dips his fingers inside John, coating them in slick, then brings his fingers to his lips. 
John watches, his cheeks burning hot as both embarrassment and arousal course through him. 
Sherlock licks his fingers, sucking John's slick from them. 



""You taste so good. I bet you feel even better."" He chuckles, low and deep.



His big hard alpha cock pulses against a John's tight, eager to fuck his omega. He leans in and kisses John deeply, wrappings John's legs around his waist. He rocks his hips slowly, rubbing his cock against John's.



""Do you want me to fuck you, John? Sink every inch of my cock inside you? Knot you and pump my seed as far as it will go?""



""God, yes... Please, Sherlock. Be the first and only one to fill me with your knot.""



John rakes his fingers down Sherlock's back and groans. For the first time in his life, he feels the tip of an Alpha's cock press against his hole. 
However, instead of thrusting in and instantly claiming him, Sherlock hovers as if frozen in time. Their eyes meet and there's a hint of a question in Sherlock's expression.



""Take me,"" John grunts, thrusting his hips forward and crying out as Sherlock eases inside him.



""Christ!"" John shouts, his nails digging into the flesh of Sherlock's hips as a rush of slick pours from him like a waterfall. ""Oh.. my god.""



Sherlock slowly pushes all the way into him. He stills, letting them both get used to the feeling. He whimpers softly, never having felt anything like this before.



He pants, holding himself above John. He wasn't sure what to do. ""What do I do, John? I.. I don't know what to do."" He says softly.



His instincts tell him to rut and thrust and claim and while that may feel good he doesn't think that's good. ""I want to please you. Take care of you. What should I do?""



John softens his grip on Sherlock's hips and lets out a sigh. Sherlock felt amazing inside him, satisfying him like no toy had ever been able to satisfy. 
With a smirk, he closes his eyes and seeks out the switch that allows him to change the intensity of his pheromones. 
This close, and already connected, it takes less than thirty seconds before he can see the change in Sherlock's expression. His eyes cloud over and his mouth gapes open and his nostrils flare. 
Bracing himself on his right elbow, John hooks a leg around one of Sherlock's and flips them with ease so he's on top. 
He places Sherlock's hands on the iron bars of the headboard and wraps Sherlock's fingers around the bars.



""Hold that, and don't let go."" he says in a seductive voice, bending low and hovering his lips mere centimeters away from Sherlock's lips.



When Sherlock leans forward, attempting to press their lips together in a kiss, John plants a hand on Sherlock's chest and pushes him back to the bed. 
With one hand braced on Sherlock's chest, the other on the headboard, John gets one leg underneath him and begins to fuck himself on Sherlock's cock. 
He wants to touch himself or have Sherlock touch him. But he doesn't, he denies himself touch, curious to see if he could come just from riding his Alpha's cock.



""When your knot swells, you can let go."" He says through heaving gasps for air as he bounced up and down, taking Sherlock's cock fully into himself with each thrust.



Sherlock moans as he watches John, enraptured by his omega. He plants his feet on the bed and thrusts up when John comes down.



""My omega. Mine. So hot. Perfect. Mine. Mine always. Just for me. I'm yours, John. All yours. Always. Hate being away from you. It hurts. Makes my insides cold. Don't leave me. Please. I'll be good. I'll be so good to you. Whatever you want it's yours. Whatever you want to do I'll support you. Anything. Anything."" He rambles.



""Mine...""John growls back, his body arching as Sherlock's cock slides over his prostate. ""My Alpha... Mine. Fuck me like you want me.""



The nails of his left hand dig into Sherlock's skin, not hard enough to draw blood, but they leave red welts along Sherlock's pale skin as his hand slides from Sherlock's collarbones to his stomach.



""I'm going to knot you and bite you. Bonding us. Keep you with me. Always. So good John. You feel so good."" Sherlock groans, rocking deeper.



His instincts are telling him to pin John underneath him and take everything he can. He ignores them in favor of watching John fuck himself on his cock. 
John's thighs begin to burn, but he ignores it. His physical discomfort is nothing compared to the pleasure he's getting from his Alpha. 
Sherlock's words sink deep into his mind. Creating a memory that he knows will last a lifetime. 
He pulls his right hand down from the headboard and places it on Sherlock's chest, crying out as he fucked himself harder on Sherlock's cock.



""I'm, God I'm close. Oh god, please, Sherlock.. now.""



In one swift calculated move, Sherlock turns them over and somehow keeps the pace John had going. He sinks his fingers into John's hair and gently tugs his head to the side. 
Sherlock's knot starts to catch and with one snap of the hips, he knots John and sinks his teeth into the spot John had pointed out, bonding them together. 
There's no fear, no last-minute regret, or any negative thoughts. John lets Sherlock pull his neck to the side, and watches with hungry eyes as his Alpha surges forward. 
The slightest pinching sensation registers in John's senses, but it's no worse than a shot, or getting a sliver. Though he feels muscles tear as sharp teeth sink into his neck, he doesn't cry out with pain or have flashbacks of the bullet sinking into his shoulder. 
Instead, he moans, and with hot pulses comes against Sherlock's stomach. He can feel Sherlock, just inside him physically, but in his mind. 
There, inside him, is a piece of Sherlock floating in his consciousness. He can feel Sherlock's emotions, feel the pleasure his Alpha is receiving from his body. 
Sherlock's tongue laves over the area between his teeth, his saliva numbing John's neck. He nuzzles the side of his face against the top of Sherlock's head and whispers.



""Finally... there you are."" John breathes, running his hands through Sherlock's hair.



Sherlock gently licks at the bites, his instincts telling him to clean and heal his mate. ""Okay?"" He mumbles softly.



""Quite alright, actually."" John grins lazily as his hands roam across Sherlock's back. 
""Did... did you come? I admit I was a tad preoccupied to notice.""



He wiggles his hips, testing the feel of his first knotting experience. With a grin he pushes back against Sherlock, pushing the knot deeper inside him.



""So much better than that toy. I can feel your heartbeat pulsing through your knot.""



Sherlock groans as John pushes back against him, squeezing more cum from him. ""It would be next to impossible not to come with you."" He chuckles a bit breathlessly.



""How does your neck feel? It's not bleeding too badly."" He asks, looking at their bond mark and feeling a swell of pride.



John purses his lips and rolls his neck from side to side, then shakes his head.



""Fine. I can hardly feel it. Well,"" he says softly, ""I can feel it, but there's no pain. I can feel you, like you're a part of me. Like... oh god, you're my jiminy cricket.""



John starts to laugh, deep laughs that leave him gasping for breath. He can feel Sherlock's pulse inside him with every shake of his body, but he can't stop.



""You're the bloody cricket telling me what to do.""



""The feeling is mutual."" Sherlock chuckles softly, nuzzling John. ""It's nice. I.. I like it.""



John's emotions level out and come back to some sense of normal. He stops laughing, wiping a tear from the corner of his eyes, and apologizes. 
""Sorry... I've read that Omegas can get emotional after a bond. but... I didn't think they meant I'd be laughing my arse off while I have a cock shoved up my arse.""



""It's alright. I like hearing you laugh. And it squeezes my knot."" Sherlock snorts, relaxing.



""I'm probably crushing you. Do you want to roll over so you can lay on top of me?""



""No... no.. I like this. You feel nice on top of me."" John says while nuzzling around Sherlock's neck. He smells like sweat and sex, but now underneath the scents John had come to think of as Sherlock there was something new. Something sweet, like coming home to find freshly made baked goods waiting for you on the table. 

When you're happy or I've complimented you it's like freshly baked cinnamon rolls dripping with glaze.




""Ohhh..."" John sighs, breathing in a lungful of the new scent. ""Oh... I.. that's me, mixed with you, isn't it?""



""It's you."" Sherlock smiles softly and kisses John tenderly.



""Fantastic..."" John mumbles around soft kisses.

          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

They lay like that for some time. Eventually, Sherlock is able to pull free. He moves away, though he doesn't move far, and lays on his side watching John.

Slick and Sherlock's come oozes out of John. For a moment he wants to reach for a flannel and clean himself off. But he's hard again, and he knows Sherlock won't be far behind.

""This time... be rough with me. We can test how sturdy this bed frame is."" Rolling onto his side John reaches out and begins coaxing Sherlock's erection back to life with his fingers. ""Is it even a first heat if something doesn't break?""

""I'll take you properly this time."" Sherlock groans, his cock thickening at John's touch. He kisses John again and presses him back to the mattress. ""If it's too much just let me know."" He mumbles against his lips.

Sherlock kisses him some more and decides he wants John's on his hands and knees to take him from behind. Or maybe he wants to pin him to the wall and fuck him hard enough to makes the frames on the wall rattle. ""Would you rather I take you from behind or hold you up as I fuck you against the wall?""

""Why not both?"" John says as his heart flutters in his chest. ""Why not... against the wall, first? Before we're too tired to stand up?""

""Mm good idea,"" Sherlock smirks and gets up. Before John can protest Sherlock scoops John up. He carries him a few steps and presses John to the wall.

Sherlock kisses John deeply and wraps John's legs around himself. ""You may want to hold on."" He growls softly and slowly pushes his cock into John's slick dripping hole.

""Fuuucckkk!"" John cries and throws his arms around Sherlock's neck for support.

""So fucking big..."" John growls, dragging his teeth over Sherlock's exposed neck. ""So hard inside me. God, it feels so good. If only you were there, during my first heat.""

""I'll take care of you through the rest of them. You'll have my cock deep inside you making you feel better. Fucking you through your heat."" Sherlock slowly starts to thrust until he feels John relax and then sets a deep steady pace.

Sherlock's body is coated in a sheen of sweat, which allows John's cock to glide smoothly along Sherlock's stomach with every thrust. He leans his forehead against his Alpha's shoulder and begins to chant a series of curses and praises.

""Fuck, fuck... oh god, yeah, right there... Don't stop, Sherlock. God,"" he pants out. Suddenly he's overcome with Sherlock inside his mind. He can feel Sherlock's pleasure as if it were his own. With a tiny yelp, he comes hard, his cock trapped between Sherlock's writhing body.

Sherlock keeps thrusting, his knot filling out. He presses John harder against the wall and knots his mate, filling him with more hot come. He pants and holds John up, pressing kisses to his neck and shoulder.

""Mine,"" John says, pressing open-mouthed kisses to the pale expanse of Sherlock's neck.

""Mine,"" he repeats, scraping his teeth over Sherlock's scent gland.

""Mine,"" he says for the third time, then, without thinking, sinks his teeth into Sherlock's neck.

He's met with no resistance, despite his teeth not being sharp like an Alpha's. It's like Sherlock's scent gland had been made purposely with John's teeth in mind. John can feel the change instantly. His awareness of Sherlock becomes sharper. He can see the world in a different colour. Gone are the shadows of history as he looks around the room.

The carpet is worn in a line, and his mind instantly knows it's from ceaseless pacing. There are divots in the rug from where the bed had once sat two feet to the left. He isn't sure how he knows... he just knows. Slowly, he pulls his teeth out of Sherlock's skin and arches against the wall. Sherlock's neck is bleeding, and he knows what he needs to do to stop it.

""Bed... bed, now."" He hisses, pushing away from the wall with his elbows.

Though dazed, Sherlock stumbles back a few feet. Once Sherlock is flat on his back, John sits up and reaches behind him. He slides his fingers through his cheeks, and they come back coated in slick and come.

The doctor in him screams that this is wrong. That he needs to clean and dress the wound, then apologize for inflicting such a wound on his Alpha. But the Omega in him takes over, bashing the stupid doctor on the head and telling him to shut up. John places his sex-covered fingers over the wound and rubs their combined juices into the bite. Instantly it stops bleeding and part of his mind relaxes. He rubs a bit more in, then leans forward and begins lapping at the mess, cleaning Sherlock's neck until he's gotten most of the slick cleaned up.

""I... sorry..."" he mutters, ""Don't know why I did that.""

""Don't.. apologize."" Sherlock pants. ""Perfect. So good. I.. you."" He mumbles, overwhelmed by the new feelings and sensations. He can feel where John's body is sore, rubbing his hands over the spots and working out the strain. ""It.. You. You're in my head. I can.. I can feel you.""

""I... I can think like you..."" John screws up his face at the onslaught of thought. ""Sort of. It's... deafening. Is your mind always this chaotic?""

""Yeah. Sorry. Here."" Sherlock scents John, rubbing his face along John's scent glands. He knows how much John's scent helps calms his mind so he hopes his scent does the same for John.

""Oh... oh that's better."" John sighs as his mind calms down a bit. ""Sherlock... what happened? Is that because I... I bit you?""

""I think so."" Sherlock hums, gently pressing kisses to John's skin. ""I've never heard of an omega biting an alpha back. I'll do some research later."" He mumbles.

He can feel the heat from John's body, the need, and the longing. ""Having me close does help you, doesn't it?"" He asks softly, sounding surprised that he actually helped John feel better.

""It... it just felt right. One moment my brain was telling me that you're my mate. The next.. my teeth were sinking into you like your skin was made of butter.""

John nuzzles down against Sherlock's body, whimpering a bit when Sherlock finally slipped out of him.

""There's no pain, no cramps... I don't even feel sex-crazed. I just feel... happy. Like we've just decided to take a few days off to have sex for the heck of it.""

Sherlock chuckles softly and stills when the doorbell rings. He growls before remembering it's their order. ""I have to go get our order."" He kisses John before getting up.

""Bring me back a snack,"" John asks lazily, curling up on his side and dragging the blanket up over him.

""Of course."" Sherlock nods and pulls on a robe. He goes down to the door and collects the order, ignoring how the delivery boy looks at him oddly.

After putting away the things that need to stay cold, he carries snacks up to John. ""Here, John. Drink."" He passes him an electrolyte replenishing drink as he opens a package of jerky.

""Fuck... I was thirsty..."" John pants after downing the bottle in two gulps.

""You should drink one as well. Then... come here. I have a sudden desire to suck on your neck until the skin is purple beneath your bite..""

Sherlock stuffs a piece of jerky in front of John's face with a look that says Wait

""Fine.. fine.. I'll eat something so I don't pass out. But... I did just have a slice of pizza..."" he looks at the clock,"" Three hours ago.""

""And you've already burned that off from sex. Eat and drink and then you can do whatever you'd like to me."" Sherlock drinks another bottle, the cold liquid hitting his stomach.

""I was rather hoping,"" John says, sinking his teeth into a piece of jerky, ""That you'd have your way with me..."" He blushes scarlet, then continues, ""I want to be thoroughly taken... I want you to have every ounce of me, Take me like the Alphas in the movies, Sherlock.""

Sherlock raises a brow and considers it. ""Alright. I suppose I can loosen the reins a bit on the alpha side.""

He sits in the bed and opens a pack of chocolate-covered almonds. ""I'll call you my dirty little omega. Made for my cock. How you gag for my cock. How desperate you are for me. How you're gushing slick for me.""

A shiver runs down John's spine. With wide eyes, he nods his head.

""Just for you..."" he says softly, pinching a nut from Sherlock's palm. ""I want those things, just from you.""

Sherlock leans in and nuzzles at their bond mark. ""You waited for me. Just for me, omega. You knew I'd find you eventually. Make you mine. Bond you. Knot you."" He mumbles. ""Love you.."" He adds softly.

John's heart stops beating for a moment then he lets out a long drawn-out sigh.

""Love you too. I'm glad you're my first. This is so... intimate. I can't imagine spending a heat with someone, then having to just... casually see them around.""

Sherlock closes his eyes, memorizing John telling him he loves him.

He hums and nods. ""It's too much almost. So many feelings and thoughts and sensations. Yours is.. comforting. Knowing you. Hearing you. I can't believe people can do this with total strangers.""

""Neither can I,"" John says, shaking his head. ""The risk of coming through bonded besides the fact... It's one thing to have sex, another thing to actually crave a cock.""

John dips his hand into the bag of jerky and takes out another piece, then pushes Sherlock to the bed. He pops the jerky into his mouth and straddles Sherlock's hips.

""Need you, now...""

""Oh? Do you?"" Sherlock chuckles as he watches John chew. He reaches down and strokes John's cock. ""My horny little omega. So needy for me. For my cock.""

""I don't just need your cock, Alpha... I need you to fill me with your cock and seed. Someday I'll beg you to pump a pup into me... for now..."" John pants, sliding Sherlock inside him. ""For now, fuck me like you're trying to breed me anyway.""

Sherlock growls softly and rolls them, pressing John to the bed and kissing him deeply. ""You want that? To carry my pup? To watch your body swell and grow my offspring?"" His words are a growl, deep and demanding. This, talking of pups, makes his alpha howl and want to rut, to breed his omega. ""You'd look so good carrying my whelps. Watching you waddle around the flat. Nesting and preening. So pretty for me. I'll make you fat with my pups. You love it. Built for it."" Thrust after powerful thrust he delivers.

""Oh god..."" It's all John can do to brace himself against Sherlock's chest. He hunches forward and lets his Alpha take him. Suddenly Sherlock's hands are grabbing his hips and he's being pulled off before his Alpha can knot him. John whimpers, and begins to protest. But he's shoved roughly onto the bed, where he falls face first. Strong hands grip his hips once more, lifting his arse up into the air. John gets the hint, and shuffles his knees underneath him until he's kneeling, then Sherlock's cock is back, hot and heavy, and thrusting deeper than before.

""Fuck"" John shouts, his voice echoing off the walls.

""My omega. Mine. Bonded to me."" Sherlock grips John's hips, pounding into him fast and deep. He angles his thrusts to rub John's prostate as he wants to fill the deepest place he can inside John.

""You want that, don't you? For me to knock you up. You're made to carry my pups."" He thrusts harder, the headboard slamming against the wall.

""Oh god... two or more at once... Yes..."" John pants out, his voice is broken and raspy. ""Alpha pups, Omega pups... inside me. Please Sherlock... fill me.""

""Come. Come for me, omega, and I'll knot you. Fill you with my seed. Make you swell."" Sherlock growls and leans over John, nipping at his ear.

""Yes..."" John breathes. He ruts his cock against the bed, finding just enough friction to come. He cries out Sherlock's name, his muscles clenching around his Alpha and collapses against the bed

Sherlock drives his knot into John and comes hard, his cock pumping his seed deep into John.

Once he catches his breath he pulls back a bit and lays them on their side. He holds John close and kisses his back. ""I've got you. I'm right here."" He says softly, something telling him to reassure John.

""Mmmmmm..."" John hums, resting his back against Sherlock's chest.

""This is nice too... But I do like Big Bad Alpha... it's kind of hot.""

""I'll work on the persona."" Sherlock chuckles softly.

""How would we do this... my heat, if we had kids?"" John wonders aloud as they lay there. ""I wouldn't ask Mrs. Hudson to watch them.. not for days on end. And I'm sure as hell not leaving them to roam the flat on their own, or send them off to daycare...""

""Molly and Lestrade could help."" Sherlock hums. ""If we get desperate there's Mycroft."" He grumbles.

""What about your parents... when we were there for the party, your mother said something about babysitting..."" John had rolled his eyes at the time but now, it was a real consideration. Accidents could happen, and he'd certainly been filled with more than enough come to get him pregnant.

""What time is it? I need to take my tablet soon I think.""

Sherlock looks at the time. ""Twelve minutes."" He hums. ""I suppose my parents could. If we have pups your heat will be delayed until they're weaned.""

""Oh god, I'd get breasts...well, sort of."" John groans, then he stops as a flash of desire that's not his pulses through him. ""Really? It would turn you on if my nipples puffed out with milk?""

Sherlock blushes a bit. ""I may have considered suckling."" He mumbles.

""Hmm... well."" John laughs, a bright and crisp sound in the stillness of the house. ""We'd need a bigger place, eventually. What if I have four the first go? God... my hips hurt just thinking about it.""

""We can't leave Mrs. Hudson on her own."" Sherlock frowns. ""My grandmother did leave me a large estate outside the city.""

""Then we take her with us, and hire a property manager for the flat... we'll fix up upstairs..."" John stops and slaps a hand over his face. ""God, I'm pre nesting... I'm sorry. I think my hormones are just completely haywire.""

""You've nothing to apologize for."" Sherlock nuzzles behind his ear. ""It's good to have a plan just in case. Besides we have time before we want pups."" He hisses softly as his knot goes cock, his cock slipping free.

""I'll get your pill. We can take a shower and I'll change the sheets."" Sherlock gets up and gets John's pills.

""Jesus..."" John looks down at the state of the bed for the first time and gapes. ""There isn't a dry patch to be found...""

When Sherlock comes back he already has the sheets stripped and balled up in the corner of the room. He takes his tablet, and downs another bottle of water, then drags Sherlock into the bathroom for a much needed shower.

""Just... two more days of this. Hopefully just two more days of this."" He says, as hot water hits his face.

""I'll be here with you however long it takes."" Sherlock says softly and starts to wash John's body, being gentle with the tender spots and making sure John is clean.

Here begins our fun little plot twist!

Sherlock and John head home from the case newly bonded...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

London is a breath of fresh air as John steps out of the rental car. Everywhere he looks, he sees the city with a hint of how Sherlock must see it. People are more defined, their emotions on display for him like actors overplaying their roles.

He grabs their bags out of the boot and winces. His muscles are sore, and he has more than a few scrapes and bruises. Sherlock is no better.

Between the left half of his forehead being one giant bruise, and the fingernail marks John knows are beneath his well-tailored suit, neither of them are 100%.

But still, they share a smile as they pass the keys to the guy from the rental agency.

""Home,"" John says, shouldering his bag and looking up at the flat and sniffing the air. ""Mrs. Hudson is baking. Scones, I think... Did you tell her we were on our way home?""

""I called her this morning when you were making sure everything was in the car."" Sherlock nods. He resists the urge to take John's bag, knowing John wouldn't like him taking it, implying that he can't handle his own luggage.

""I suppose we're going to have to tell her we bonded."" Sherlock hums, knowing that even though Mrs. Hudson is a beta she's still smart as a whip and she'll figure it out just by looking at them.

""I suppose we should. This is rather noticeable,"" John says tilting his neck to the side and showing off his bond mark. It rested just above his collar, and while his coat partially hid the mark it would be quite obvious once his coat was taken off.

John feels a rush of pride surge through him from the bond and smirks when a low growl resonates in Sherlock's chest. He loves the way his Alpha feels when he sees the mark. It makes him feel safe and cared for.

""Let's get these upstairs and we'll tell her when she comes up to investigate how our trip went."" John suggests, wanting to put the case down once and for all to give his abused muscles a break. 

They head upstairs. Out of habit John heads towards the room upstairs but stops and turns to look at his mate. ""Seems a bit silly to have separate rooms now, if we're bonded. Don't you think?""

John had spent a good portion of the last two months in Sherlock's room, though they still maintained a bit of distance. When Sherlock was working on a case, or simply restless, John would go upstairs so the Alpha could prowl the flat without fear of waking him.

Sherlock nods. ""We'll use the downstairs room for sleeping and whatnot since it's on the main floor and close to the bathroom. The upstairs bedroom will before storage and loud sex."" He smirks and tugs John to the main floor bedroom so they can put their things away.

After everything is put away Sherlock hears Mrs. Hudson's familiar footsteps on the stairs. ""Yoo-hoo! Boys? Are you decent?"" She calls.

""Yes, Mrs. Hudson. Come in."" Sherlock chuckles softly, wondering if John can feel the warm feeling Mrs. Hudson gives him.

John steps out of the bedroom and watches their landlady closely. It takes her less than thirty seconds to see the bite. Her eyes go wide and Sherlock has to step to her side and take the tray of scones from her before they fall as she brings a hand up to cover her mouth. She looks from John to Sherlock, then back to John's neck. Having spent so many years running from his biology John feels a prickle of anger pulsing through him and he clenches his jaw. But then something warm and comforting passes through the bond and he's relaxing. Their landlady utters a noise that's half squeal half shock. But then she gathers herself, takes motions for Sherlock to put the tray down on the table.

""Sick..."" She mutters, remembering Sherlock's excuse from John's last half heat. ""Sick... Mhm. I was a fool to believe that one.""

""It wasn't my information to tell,"" Sherlock says softly. ""And you know John is still John. This doesn't change anything."" He says even though she's the one who taught him that everyone is equal no matter their secondary sex classification. ""Well I mean all that's changed is I'm his mate now."" Sherlock smiles proudly. ""I'm John Watson's mate.""

""Yeah, he's my mate."" John repeats then reaches for a scone. ""And thanks to him I'm starving. We didn't exactly stop to eat much the last few days.""

""I fed and watered you as much as you'd allow me to."" Sherlock snorts and turns in the kettle.

""I'm just happy you boys finally figured things out. I was so worried you'd never get here."" Mrs. Hudson coos.

""Wait..."" John turns and brandishes his scone at the lady. ""You knew. You knew I was an Omega. How? Even Sherlock didn't know at first.""

""John, dear, when your husband runs an international drugs and weapons transport ring you learn how to tell if someone's hiding something very quick."" Mrs. Hudson smirks.

""I'm sure the exotic dance career has nothing to do with it."" Sherlock quips.

""Bite your tongue, young man."" Mrs. Hudson tsks.

John chokes on his scone but wisely says nothing about the video he and Sherlock had stumbled across.

Eventually, they're left alone and John immediately crosses the room and wraps his arms around Sherlock. He buries his head in the folds on Sherlock's suit and mutters an apology.

""My first reaction is anger when people see me as an Omega. I'm sorry... But I need you to know it has nothing to do with your status as my mate. I just hid it, for so many years. It'll take some getting used to, being out in the open like this.""

""You don't have to apologize, John. It's a very raw visceral feeling when people see you as less than or incompetent because of who they assume you are. I see you as John first and my mate second. Omega isn't even in the top ten list of things I associate with you."" Sherlock holds John close and scents him, letting John know he's forgiven even though there's nothing to forgive.

""Being seen as an omega can put you in a dangerous position. You've learned to defend and protect yourself. If you want to keep being perceived as a beta I have no problem with that. We can get something to cover your bond mark."" He kisses John's head but the mention of covering John's mark makes his insides squirm.

""I just want you to be safe and happy. However, you decide to do that I'll support you."" He rubs his hands over John's back.

""Cover it up? God.. no. I don't want to cover it up."" John says quickly, pulling away to glare at Sherlock as if he'd just suggested John run barefoot over a path made out of loose lego bricks.

""Why would I cover it up? I'm safe, now. I'm bound to you. Only you can smell my Omega side now.""

John has his head on Sherlock's chest when a faint tapping sound reaches his ears. He looks up and finds Sherlock staring at the door with a snarl on his face. John closes his eyes and heaves a sigh.

""Only been home ten minutes. Of course, Mycroft would pop over to say hello""

""Stay here and I'll go dispatch him. I don't need him dampening our new bond."" Sherlock nuzzles John before heading down the stairs.

He whips the door open and glares. ""Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me."" He hissed.

""What? What's that smell?"" John wrinkles his nose then Sherlock in hissing. Only, his hiss is made out of predatory instincts, rather than annoyance.

""You've got to be fucking kidding me."" He echoes, ""Doesn't that arsehole know its proper to give a newly bonded couple a month of privacy? Who's behind this, your brother, or the military?"" he wonders out loud

""I don't care. I want them gone."" Sherlock growls. ""Probably Mycroft. The military knows it would get a shit storm for infringing on a newly bonded pair. My brother pisses where he likes."" Sherlock goes down and opens the door.

""Go the fuck away."" He snarls at his brother and the lackey who's accompanied him.

The stench of two annoyed male Alphas assaults John's senses. Mycroft's sour citrusy scent nearly overpowers Sherlock's, making John want to whimper.

Instead, he grits his teeth and puts the kettle on. He purposely only fills it with enough water for two. He knows why Mycroft is here, and it isn't for a social call, or to wish the bonded couple well.

He's here to record proof of the bond. A picture of John's neck that will forever remain in his file. Proof for the government, so they know just how many Omega's they Don't have to worry about running about the city without a legal alpha.

If Sherlock is unsuccessful in getting rid of Mycroft, at the very least, John will show Mycroft just how unwanted his visit is by not making him a cup of tea.

""If both of you don't leave right I'll fight the two of you right here,"" Sherlock growls.

Three sets of feet make their way up the stairs. John lets out a resigned sigh and undoes the top three buttons of his shirt. Every Omega knows this scenario.

First: An alpha bites you, leaves his mark on you that you'll carry with you until one of two things happen. 1) you die, of old age or other means. 2) And this usually only happened to those who bonded to a friend or schoolyard crush in hopes that they wouldn't be sold off to another Alpha... they could (would be forced to) undergo a painful medical procedure that would chemically remove the proteins and enzymes given to the Omega during the bonding process, resetting the Omega back to their original state. If they survived the process.

Second: The newly bonded couple would, at the very least, be given one week to be alone, to strengthen their bond.

Thirdly: Between one week and one month, the bonded couple would go down to the registration office and their bond would be recorded. The Alpha would sign a paper stating that the bond was consensual. (Which 8 out of 10 times was a load of bollocks) and the Omega would be subjected to having his or her bite inspected. In the modern age, pictures would be taken of the bite, and a mold of the Alpha's teeth would also be gathered. The officiate would then file everything away, where most often none of the information would ever see the light of day again.

When Sherlock enters the room again, his eyes lit with righteous fury, John just gives him a sad smile and flicks his color away from his neck. ""Let's get this over with.""

Sherlock grumbles and sticks the tray of goo in his mouth to get his bite imprint, the whole time staring daggers at his brother and the official. The officiate takes the picture of John's neck and has them both fill out some paperwork. Sherlock pulls the imprint of his bite out and hands it over as well.

""I think that's all."" The officiant says.

""It certainly is not."" Sherlock unbuttons his shirt and shows the bite mark on his neck. ""This goes in the file as well."" He smirks when he sees Mycroft pale.

John has almost finished buttoning his shirt back up when Sherlock's words make his fingers freeze. Someone is stuttering, and John thinks it's Mycroft, but he can't tear his eyes off of Sherlock long enough to glance over at the other two men.

""Sherlock?"" John asks, eyes wide and his voice breathless, ""What are you doing?""

""If your bond mark is going on the file then so is mine. I bit you and you bit me back. I don't see why your mark gets to go in the file but mine doesn't."" Sherlock pulls his shirt over. ""Take the bloody picture already."" He snaps at the officiate.

Mycroft speaks first. With a flick of his hand, he motions the officiate forward.

""Best just do it. Neither my brother nor Doctor Watson will appreciate our interference at a future date.""

""Damn right we won't,"" John growls. As the man nears Sherlock and touches the bite (as if making sure it was real) John's lips pull back and he lets out a feral snarl. ""Take the damn picture and get out."" He hisses while moving forward. Mycroft stops him with a palm against his chest before he can get to Sherlock's side.

At first, the act angers John, he steps back and gives Mycroft a brisk nod. The thought of anyone touching Sherlock there makes him murderous, and he can't be quite sure what he'd do to the officiate if he'd been allowed to get any closer.

Once the pictures are taken, the officiate all but scurries out of the room. They hear him practically running down the stairs. Only then does Mycroft lower his hand. John rushes forward and pushes Sherlock up against the wall, rubbing his head across Sherlock's neck, then licking away any remnants of the other man's scent.

""Mine."" he purrs, once Sherlock smells like them again.

Sherlock holds John close and scents him and nuzzles. ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" He apologizes and then pulls back.

In one swift move, he slams Mycroft back against the wall, his hand tight around his throat. ""If you ever and I mean ever touch my mate again I'll rip that cold black shriveled organs from your chest where your heart should be. If you ever pull some bullshit like this again I'll tell Mummy about your arrangement with Anthea."" He snarls, his hand so tight around his brother's neck it's sure to bruise.

""By law, we're allowed one week, Mycroft,"" John seethes, coming up to stand directly behind Sherlock.

He looks at how Sherlock's holding Mycroft and gives his mate a satisfied nod. He's holding most of the pressure up just under his chin, no risk of crushing his windpipe. And probably no long-term damage to vocal cords. For once, the doctor in him doesn't care that he's witnessing another man in distress.

""Did you think I'd come out of this heat pregnant? Trying to... rush things along, are you? What was your goal, pulling this stunt?""

""Court- Marshal."" Mycroft manages to get out.

Sherlock frowns and drops his hand. ""What?""

""Court Martial over what? I'm not even bloody enlisted!"" John barks, and this time it's Sherlock who holds him back.

""What are they mad about? Me ordering that desk jockey around? That's his bloody job, to help Omegas like me. He messed up, miscalculated when I needed to swap brands.""

""A piece of legislation that was approved under the radar. After an omega who was registered with the military registers with an alpha, they have sixty days to have their bond filed or else the military assumes hold back over the omega and bonds that omega to an alpha without their consent. We're on day fifty-nine."" Mycroft rubs his throat.

Sherlock growls, angry at Mycroft and alphas in general.

""Fuck them..."" John growls and turns to the kettle. The water in it has long since gone cold. He adds a bit more water to it, then flicks it on again. This time with the intention of offering Mycroft a cup.

""Why didn't they tell me? I'm allowed that information. Fuck..."" He swears again and drags his hands through his hair. Anxiety at how close he'd been to having it all, just to lose it, makes him start to shake.

""When your legal responsibility is changed from the military to a civilian alpha they don't have to inform you of anything anymore since you are no longer their responsibility until they assume control of you again and at that point, they decide who to bond you with. After your service is concluded the only thing you're useful to for them is providing pups. Which if the alpha you're bonded to at the time is still active duty the pups become ward of the military that you get the privilege of raising for them."" Mycroft frowns.

John reaches up for a third mug and slams it down on the counter.

""My life, my body... not theirs."" He spins around and glares at Mycroft. ""You change the rules of the universe on a daily basis, it's like, squashing ants for you. Why hasn't this changed? Why are we property just because our insides are different?""

Mycroft offers him a sad smile but doesn't say anything. John just nods and turns back to fix the tea.

""Yeah, I know... money. People like being rich, and If I can produce them cute little Omega pups for them to sell off, why would they give me up."" The brothers both take milk and sugar in their tea. John fixes the three mugs then moves them to the table, motioning for the two alphas to sit. ""Calm down you two, I'd be able to smell you from speedies. Mycroft, have you ever seen... that, before?"" John motions to Sherlock's neck and shrugs.

""It was... instinctual, my body told me to do it, so I did it. We were too busy wrapping up statements with the French Police to look into it. We don't know if it will last, or if he'll have a mark. But both of our awareness changed. I see things like he does, sharper, with more clarity. My mind is a chaotic midfield of data. He... he smells things like I do, like an Omega now.""

Sherlock opens the kitchen window before sitting next to John to air the flat out.

""It,"" Mycroft thinks of how to word it. ""It's a sign of a perfect match.""

Leave a comment and let us know what you think!

Big brother leaves a parting message...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""It.."" Mycroft thinks of how to word it. ""It's a sign of a perfect match.""

""That's a real thing?"" Sherlock gapes, having heard the stories like all pups had about finding your perfect biological match.

""That's the only thing I can think of. I'll have to look into it more."" Mycroft sighs.

""Perfect match?"" John says, testing the words out on his lips. ""Meaning... he and I were supposed to bond? We were meant for each other?""

As soon as he says it, he knows it's right. Of course, it is.

""Alpha and Omega... beginning and the end,"" John says softly, reaching under the table to place a hand on Sherlock's knee. ""Revelation 22 can't remember the verse. But something about... give to each one according to what he has done.""

The brothers gape at him and John rolls his eyes.

""Didn't you two go to Sunday school? Out of context, because of course, that was talking about the end times. But... give unto each one what he has done. A bite for a bite. Fuck, it makes sense.""

John curls his free hand around his mug and stares at a spot in the center of the table. ""Can't imagine it's common, nowadays... Are there any others like us?""

Sherlock and Mycroft just stare at John, a little confused and surprised.

""It's rare. Very rare. Because the way omega's are sold off to the highest bidder it's very unlikely to be their true match. Those kinds of things have to develop naturally. Or so the story goes."" Mycroft shrugs.

Sherlock rubs a hand over his face, confused about all of this.

""If people only knew..."" John says a bit sadly, squeezing Sherlock's knee before scrubbing at his own face. ""This... is a whole new level of living. It's more than just an awareness of his moods and well-being. It's... like my brain is half him, half me.""

He sips his tea in silence after that, mind racing as he imagined a world where everyone knew about this possibility, and Omegas were no longer simply sold off.

Sherlock rests his hand on John's and holds it. He feels John's anger but also his profound sadness.

""I can't imagine the strength it takes to deal with him in your head."" Mycroft quips and sips his tea.

""I like it,"" John shrugs. ""It helped me stop him from punching the police this morning. Sherlock, we can't just keep what we have a secret. Is there anything we can do?""

""He does have a knack for getting into fights."" Mycroft muses.

""I don't know if we'd be believed. If anything it would make us a target if people who want to keep it hidden."" Sherlock sighs.

""Well, I'm not hiding it..."" John says, though deep down he's afraid that Sherlock is correct. ""I just won't make a blog post about it.""

""Mycroft, are you able to find out if there are any records, past or present, of Alpha's who have had bites on their necks recorded? They're public records... so it shouldn't be illegal."" Sherlock asks suddenly.

""I can look into it."" Mycroft nods.

""This could be grounds for law changes. It infringes on alphas bodily autonomy which is illegal. If an alpha's perfect mate is out there and it's sold off to someone else that could mean the alpha could sue for rights if the omega."" Sherlock frowns.

""But then we run into a major issue... How do you find your perfect mate? Matchmaking websites? Are there tests? Do we go back to the old ways, where an Alpha would court an Omega, and it was the Omega protected by the law?""

John mirrors Sherlock's frown and drums his fingers on the tabletop.

""Two hundred years ago, it was the Omega who called the shots. The courting rituals in their favour. Alphas could line up at their doorsteps and beg to court them, but the Omega could brush them off and walk away unscathed. We're all read those stories by our Omega parents. It ends with one Alpha getting mad that an Omega chose someone else over him, he caused a coup and brought the whole system down. I used to think they were just stories... but what if there's more truth to it?""

""We need to do research."" Sherlock nods.

Mycroft nods and stands. ""I'll do what I can and get the both of you as much evidence as I can.""

""Where do we even begin,"" John snorts, ""The library?""

He looks up at Mycroft as he reaches for his umbrella and offers the man a nod of thanks before watching him go. Turning back to his alpha he tilts his head and grins.

""We could go to the museum. Maybe if we look at old art, we'll see something? Plus, it would be nice to get out and stretch my legs after spending the last few days in bed.""

Sherlock nods. ""That's a good start. I also think we should talk to older omega's. It would be them who remember the stories passed down to them about having power over their lives.""

""Yeah, that sounds like a logical step."" John drags his hand through his hair and sighs. ""This... sounds dangerous.""

""I think for now we spend time together and recover. Strengthen our bond. And then we can take down the ruling bodies."" Sherlock hums.

""Well then, come strengthen it in the shower. Mm, no wait, the bath. We still have a bath bomb left."" John stands and heads down the hall, smiling when he hears Sherlock's chair scrape across the floor.

""Bring some wine, and the scones,"" he calls out as he steps into the bathroom. He looks at the tub and feels a wash of happiness. Since that first bath, when Sherlock had sat with his back turned towards him, the bath had remained free of experiments. As if, Sherlock had seen how much John enjoyed soaking in the tub and wanted to make sure John could do it whenever he wanted.

Sherlock brings wine and scones as John requests. ""Would you like to be behind me or me behind you?"" He asks as he strips.

""You've got the longer legs. Last time I was in back you looked like a grown-up in one of those battery-powered kiddie cars. You in back until we get a bigger tub.""

It's a bit of a struggle, but they manage to get into the tub together. John rests his back against Sherlock's chest and reaches for the wine. Sherlock has already uncorked it, so he pours out two glasses then passes one back to his mate.

""It's a bit weird, having you in my head all the time. But I think I'm going to like it. If we get separated on a case, I'll know you're safe.""

Sherlock nods. ""It makes me feel better. I feel more relaxed and not as worried about other alphas.""

John snorts then says, ""Means I don't have to worry about you doing something stupid. Like going off alone and getting yourself smacked over the head with a board.""

Sherlock prods John in the ribs, making him laugh and relent. ""That was my idea, wasn't it.""

""I suppose I ought to be more careful these days. I do have an omega after all."" Sherlock nuzzles behind John's ear.

Short chapter is short. We don't plan out chapter lengths. Just split them where it feels right. Tune in for more tomorrow!

John runs into Harry at the park...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

After a week of endless bubble baths, cuddling, and sex on every surface (Including against Mrs. Hudson's flat door when she was out one morning) John is both pleased and disappointed when a case finds its way to their doorstep.

The case itself is trivial, barely a five by Sherlock's own standards. But they're both going stir crazy, even if neither of them will admit it. John urges Sherlock out the door when Sherlock's microscope proves to be insufficient.

""Go to Bart's, use theirs. Molly won't mind."" John says, practically shoving Sherlock's arms in his coat as if dressing a child. ""I'm going to wash our bedding again then go for a walk and smell air that doesn't stink like nonstop sex.""

He kisses Sherlock on the lips, then pulls back his scarf long enough to swipe his tongue over Sherlock's bite. ""Go,"" he says softly, ""I'll be here when you get back. Tell Molly I said hello.""

Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second, then Sherlock is wrapping his arms around John so tight that for a solid ten seconds John isn't able to draw breath. ""Go,"" he croaks, pushing at his Alpha's chest.

Sherlock's laughter, rich and velvety, follow him down the stairs as he leaves. John watches the empty staircase for a moment, then busies himself with the washing up. When their room is once again presentable, he puts his own coat on and heads out to Regent's Park for a stroll.

He's barely gone one circuit around the perimeter of a park when a familiar scent makes him look to his left. There, with her nose in a book, is his older sister Harry. She's absentmindedly tossing bread at the ducks and doesn't even look up when he sits down on the blanket beside her.

""Not interested, whatever you're selling. I don't carry cash on me."" She says, turning a page.

""Then give me some bread,"" John says, reaching into an old shopping bag and pulling out a mangled piece of bread. Ripping it up he tosses it into the water. For the next minute, he ignores her gaze until she looks up at him.

Harry's head whips around to look at John. ""Jesus Christ!"" She yelps. ""What the fuck are you doing here? You haven't bloody called me since you got back. Thought you were dead in a ditch somewhere you little arsehole."" She punches his arm.

""You could have called. Phones work both ways."" John shrugs, pinching another piece of bread and feeding the small flock of ducks quacking up at him. He feels them begin to slip into the all too familiar blame game and sighs. Tossing the blast bit of bread to the ducks he shifts on the blanket and faces his sister. ""I could have called as well. But, I didn't."" Their only form of communication, if it can even be called that, has been when Harry commented on his blog and he replied. Best just to get it over with then,  ""I, well, I have some news. But you're not going to like it.""

Harry had been the Alpha who had been required to sign over his ownership when he'd joined the army. With their dad gone Harry had defaulted to making his legal choices. She hadn't been pleased with his choice, but their mum had convinced her to let John join. Still, John knew she felt a sense of ownership about him and had been angry when he hadn't asked her to take it back when he'd returned home.

""I... well, I bonded."" He tilts his neck to let his older sister see the mark. Still fresh, it was red, with a bit of bruising around the teeth marks, but it would be clear to anyone who looked at it that John had not struggled while receiving it. It was clean, with no torn flesh, just perfect incisions.

""WHAT. THE. FUCK!"" Harry growls, pulling John close to inspect his neck. ""And you didn't tell me! Jesus, John! I'm supposed to look out for you! And you just shack up with some random alpha! Knew I should have kept a closer eye on you. Can't leave you alone for five minutes. Wanting to join the bloody army and now this. Do you not have any self-preservation skills at all?"" She snaps, touching the bond. ""It's new. Really new. Where the hell is this alpha then? Letting you walk around alone freshly bonded? I'll bash their fucking head in."" She growls.

""Touch my mate, and I will bite your fucking fingers off,"" John snarls at his sister. The blinks, realizing just how true that statement was. Not because it was Harry, being a bitch and insisting she knew how to live his life better than he did. But because he would hurt anyone who hurt Sherlock. No questions asked, he would.

""I'm a grown fucking man, I can go where I want when I want."" Angry John pulls out of her touch and stands. ""But you're one of them, aren't you? Who prefers their Omega's trapped indoors perpetually pregnant until their body is so exhausted it kills them when they get pregnant one too many times? Is that what you want for me, Harry? Is your life only worth how many pups I produce?""

""That's not what I said, John."" Harry snaps. ""You bonded someone without even telling me! I'm your sister for Christ's sake! Didn't even invite me to the bonding ceremony. Trying to cut me out of your life totally? You've been trying to get away from our family since you were old enough to walk. And now you've and gone got yourself bonded to someone. What changed? You always hated the idea of being trapped with someone for the rest of your life. Did you go into heat and get in trouble? Begged anything with a knot to make it better?"" She snarls.

John's already on his feet and walking towards his flat. Taller than him by several inches, Harry catches up easily, even stopping long enough to shove her book and blanket into her handbag. Setting his jaw he hurries on, knowing that no one in their right mind would stop an Alpha from chasing after an Omega. And his bond bite, high above his collar, now told the world exactly what he was. Harry's heels click on the stone path as she shouts after him, demanding him to stop. He doesn't stop, he resists the itch between his shoulders, the urge to listen to the Alpha, his blood. Getting to the main road he flags down a cab and climbs in. Before he has a chance to shut the door, Harry sticks her hand in the door and snarls at John to push over. He has half a mind to slide to the other side and exit the car. But one look from the Alpha driver, and a deafening click, tells him the auto safety locks have been engaged. There is no escape for John.

""221 Baker Street,"" he hisses as he slides over and makes room for his sister. ""Mum would be disappointed in you,"" he says softly then instantly regrets throwing his mother's name at Harry like an insult.

Their mother had been kind. The type of woman who could make the best out of any situation. Who could make even the saddest people smile. In love with life and her family, she had taught John to fight against society's standards for Omegas. Telling him that there was so much more to life than simply existing in it. She'd passed only a year after their father, brokenhearted at his loss and unable to bear a world where he didn't exist.

""You don't have to tell me that. I feel it with every fiber of my being."" Harry mumbles, looking out the window. ""She was my mum, too. Just because you were an omega doesn't mean that she was any less of a mum to me. Even though she liked you better.""

""She didn't like me better."" John snaps, sick of this argument. ""She needed to teach me how to not be a pushover and, as you said, how not to beg anything with a knot to make it better""

The driver gets them to their destination in record time, clearly not wanting their combined anguish to stink up his car any longer than necessary. ""My Alpha sister offered to pay,"" John grumped, rolling the window down and opening his door from the outside.

He runs into Mrs. Hudson, who's just on her way out. She frowns at Harry, as she stomps up behind John.

""John?"" She asks questioningly, making John's heart melt. He knows, in that instant, that Mrs. Hudson would put her foot down and not let Harry step one foot into her property if John expressed that was his desire.

""My sister, Mrs. Hudson. Meet Harry. And, as you have no intention of leaving me alone, sis, why don't you come up. I can sense my Alpha getting closer. He'll love to have a chat with you.""

""Would you like me to stay, dear? I can put some tea on and we can all wait for Sherlock together."" Mrs. Hudson says softly, subtly standing between Harry and John. She was just as protective over John as she was Sherlock.

""No, Sherlock should be here shortly,"" John says, leaning in and kissing her on her cheek. ""Go enjoy bridge, and brag all about your bonded couple. Sherlock will be here soon, and Harry is more bark than she is bite. After all, she can't seem to find an Omega to bond.""

John casts his sister a withering glare, then pushes the door open. In mock politeness, he says, ""After you, Alpha. Up the stairs...""

""Well, you know where my special tea for guests is."" Mrs. Hudson pats his arm and heads out. Her special tea was actually an empty tin with a small revolver inside but no one outside of their house needed to know that.

Harry rolls her eyes and goes up the stairs. ""It stinks like alpha and sex in here."" She mocks a gag and opens a window. ""This place is a mess as well. Is that a skull?"" She gawks at the skull on the mantle.

""That's Billy,"" John says, moving to the kitchen to open the window by the sink. She wasn't wrong. The flat did need a good airing out. He'd have to talk to Sherlock about an air purification system.

""My mate is a scientist, so don't touch anything weird. Chairs are safe, as is the mantle. But... can't promise that the sofa isn't covered in come.""

John's mobile buzzes in his pocket, and he smiles a bit, knowing without looking that it would be from Sherlock. He ignored it, wanting to see Harry squawk at the full wrath of Sherlock Holmes walking in to find a strange Alpha in his house.

""Sit, I'll make tea,"" John calls over to his sister and counts down the minutes until Sherlock's footsteps come barreling up the stairs.

Sherlock frowns when John doesn't answer his text since John is usually prompt with that. He pays the cabbie and gets out, noticing the window upstairs was open. He opens the door downstairs. ""John?"" He calls up as he closes the door. He notices a smell and tries to place it. It was John's and someone else. Alpha

Sherlock growls and all but flies up the stairs and throws the door open, it slams so hard against the wall it bounces back and Sherlock grips it tight.

""Who are you?"" He growls deep and dangerous, a strange alpha in his territory, and by the sounds and smells coming from the kitchen, alone with his mate. ""Who?"" He snaps again, hating to repeat himself.

John stands back, between the kitchen and the living room, with his arms crossed over his chest and a grin plastered across his face. The look on his sister's face is priceless. She's paled so severely that she looks like Casper the ghost. Her fingers dig into the arms of Sherlock's chair (in which she unwisely sat, but John wasn't about to correct her) as she cowers under the Alpha.

She knew instantly that it was his home, and that any attempts to fight him meant he could do whatever he wanted to her. Her eyes find John's, and she stares desperately at her brother.

Rolling his eyes, John uncrosses his arms from his chest and walks to Sherlock. Placing a hand on his shoulder he says softly, ""Meet my sister. She sort of followed me here.""

Sherlock relaxes a bit as John touches him. He holds John close and scents him, not taking his eyes off Harry. ""You mean she stalked you like a creep.""

""Mmhmm."" John hums, happily letting Sherlock rub his face over his entire torso and neck. ""Said some pretty rude things to me as well. What did you say, Sis? Something about... Not being able to take care of myself, wanting any knot... and... Oh yes insinuated that I only bonded with you to make it better.""

John looks over at his sister and says in a deathly quiet voice, ""You're in my Mate's chair. I suggest you move. Oh, yeah, Harry, this is Sherlock Holmes, my soul mate.""

Harry scrambles out of the chair. ""Soulmate? You know those are just stories, John. Make it easier for omega's to swallow their place.""

Sherlock makes a sound of disbelief. ""Is she always like this?"" He asks John.

""Only when she's had an Omega turn her town."" John sighs, his face still buried against Sherlock's chest.

""She was my Alpha after dad died. I think she only let me join the military because mum asked her.""

Sherlock nuzzles John's hair. ""I'll drag her out if you want.""

""No, we should all talk."" John sighs and pulls away as Harry scrambles out of Sherlock's chair and stands a ways away, doing her best to look small and nonthreatening in another Alpha's domain.

""Sit, have my chair,"" John suggests, motioning Harry to the red armchair. A growl starts in Sherlock's throat but John hushes him with a kiss.

""I'll sit on your lap if it makes you feel better. But I'm perfectly fine dragging one of the wooden chairs over.

""I had been making tea,"" John says and leaves the two Alphas to size each other up. ""I'll go finish, no taking your cocks out and comparing them, please. I do not need to see my sister's cock.""

Sherlock glares at Harry but sits across from her, looking as big and dangerous as he can.

John comes back with the tea a few minutes later and shoves a mug into Harry's hands, sloshing some of the hot liquid over the brim and onto her lap.

""Oops."" He says flatly, then hands (more carefully) Sherlock his mug. He retreats into the kitchen for his mug, then pulls a spare chair up to Sherlock's chair and sits.

""Harry here was just saying how rude it was we didn't invite her to the bonding ceremony. I agree, rude of us not to even invite ourselves.""

Rolling his eyes John glares daggers at his sister then says, ""We didn't have one, Harry. We bonded, came home, and some bloke from the registry showed up, took the pictures, and left. We haven't even discussed a party or anything like that.""

Harry wipes her hand off on her trousers. ""So you're just doing everything backward. I'm surprised you're not knocked up.""

Sherlock snarls, John's hand the only thing keeping him in his seat.

""Backwards?"" John growls, his fingers digging into Sherlock's arm. ""How is bonding backward? We talked about it, for months, Harry. We had a plan, and knew we both wanted it when my heat came.""

John sets his mug down on the table and flexes his hand. ""Or are you just mad that we didn't ask your permission first? We didn't have to. I was still a ward of the military, they expected me to bond.""

""You were my responsibility! Mum made me promise!"" Harry snaps.

""No, Mum asked you to keep me safe. Not dictate my every fucking move in life."" John growls back. ""I don't need you, and I sure as hell don't need Sherlock. But that's the point,"" John says, tightening his grip on Sherlock's arm when he feels his mate tense. ""I want him, Harry. I'm not bonded with him because I require him. I bonded with him because I want him.""

John slumps back in his chair and heaves a sigh. Scrubbing his hand through his hair he blows a breath out between his lips.

""Before him, life was grey. I was injured, you were busy telling me how I'd be perfectly healthy if I had done things your way. Harry, for Christ's sake I wanted to eat a bullet.""

His sister stops fretting with her wet trousers and looks up sharply.

""It was bad, for a while there. Then this bloke needed a flatmate, and he showed me how to live again. Life had colour again. He didn't care who or what I was, he just wanted me for me.""

John sighs and explains how they'd met, and how they'd pretended to be in a relationship. His first heat when the military had messed up his suppressants. For the first time in his life, he's fully open with his sister. He ignores how weird it is to explain the sexual requirements of his body to his own blood, but does so anyway so his sister can understand. When he's done, he looks over at Sherlock and reaches out. Pulling down Sherlock's collar he shows his sister the matching mark his Alpha now wore.

""Dad had one too? Didn't he? Just... lower on his neck?""

Harry frowns and nods, looking schooled. ""He did. Showed it off and made mum blush..""

""Really?"" Sherlock looks at John.

""Yeah,"" John says around a sigh. ""I kept thinking about it after your brother left. Wondering why mum used to read those stories to me.""

Reaching for his tea he takes a sip then shrugs over at his sister.

""It's not a myth. Some of us are just lucky enough to avoid the system of forced bondings, and get to choose our mates.""

Harry rolls her eyes. ""Maybe some of us don't want a mate."" She grumbles.

Liar flashes over Sherlock's mind.

Sherlock's voice echoes throughout John's head. Liar it says. He cocks his head at Harry, inspecting her closely then nods once.

""Then don't get one, dummy."" John sighs, ""It's always a fight with you, isn't it. You couldn't just follow me here and meet Sherlock. Instead, you have to stir things up, then lie to us.""

John gets up and opens the second window before sitting on Sherlock's lap. It's a tight squeeze, two full-grown men, but they make it work with only a minimal amount of spilled tea.

""I'm done fighting with you, and when his family throws us a surprise bonding party, I'll make sure you're invited.""

Sherlock cuddles John close, one arm around his back and the other around his legs. He nuzzles John and kisses his neck.

Harry rolls her eyes and looks anywhere else.

Ignoring his sister, John turns to his mate and kisses his forehead.

""What made you leave Bart's so quickly? Did you solve the case? Was it the uncle?""

Sherlock hums. ""It was. I have to go back and finish the analysis. But I just.. I had a feeling that I needed to come home."" He shrugs.

""You can go,"" John says, kissing Sherlock a second time. ""Mrs. Hudson offered me the special tea, plus I'm not completely defenseless. Worst case, I can just punch my sister in the nose.""

""I'm not leaving you alone with her."" Sherlock shakes his head. His alpha couldn't leave his mate alone with another alpha in his territory even if it was his omega's sister.

""I'm right here you boobs,"" Harry says, reaching out her foot in an attempt to kick John's shins.

Sherlock stops the movement with his own foot and a look of pure ice.

""Harry, for fucks sake, why are you still fighting me? Us? We're happy, you don't have to worry about your baby brother anymore. You can focus on yourself, on what you want... maybe someday you'll be an aunt. Who knows, we're kind of leaving that question up in the air right now.""

Sighing, for what felt like the hundredth time that afternoon, John stares at his sister. ""Mum would have liked him, and she'd be happy to see me happy. This is what I want, no one forced anything on me. My only complaint is his brother. If you want to be a dick to someone, be a dick to Mycroft.""

Harry makes a face. ""I'm sorry."" She finally apologizes.

Surprise makes John go completely still. He stares at his sister for a long moment then nods once.

""Are you staying for dinner, Harry? Neither of us cooks much. But we do have the top twenty takeaways on speed dial.""

""If you want me to."" Harry nods but she looks to Sherlock for permission.

""If John invites you to dinner you don't need my permission."" Sherlock sighs. ""We're equaled and you are his sister. As long as he doesn't get any ideas of inviting my brother for dinner we're fine.""

""Sherlock, If I ever invite your brother to dinner, that's me signaling to you that I'm being held against my will.""

John laughs and stands up. Then holds his hand to his sister. ""Truce?"" he asks. She nods and shakes his hand.

""Mum would have been happy for you,"" She admits after a moment.

""Angelo's?"" John asks, after smiling at his sister. ""I could go for his lasagna.""

""Mm sounds good."" Sherlock nods and scents John once more before releasing him.

He follows John out and into a cab, making sure he's between John and Harry.

Dinner is quiet, but John's pleased that things aren't awkward or forced between himself and his sister. Sherlock, for his part, was happy to sit back and watch. Only once did he give Harry a warning glance.

Later, after they see Harry off, John closes the windows and turns to Sherlock. ""Heading back to Barts?"" he asks softly.

""I don't have to. Molly can send me the results."" Sherlock shrugs. He tosses a robe over John's chair to mask Harry's scent.

Oh, Harriot. I love your passion but calm your tits. Also, funny enough, both Accident and I picture Harriot to look like Alex Kingston.

John makes a choice...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Another week goes by, and soon John is faced with a hard choice. His mobile alerts him that he has three days to take a pregnancy test (to confirm he's not pregnant) and get on the new suppressants. When Sherlock finally drags himself out of bed, wrapped in nothing but a sheet, John greets him with a cup of coffee and sits him down at the table. He explains the choice he has to make and looks at Sherlock with a nervous smile.

""Do I go back on them? Or do I ask just for more contraceptives? Or... nothing at all?""

Sherlock sips his coffee, thinking. ""It's your choice. I just want to make that clear first thing."" He says softly. ""Are you ready for pups?"" He asks, setting his mug down.

""I..."" John scrubs a hand over his face and stares at the tabletop. ""Yes and no? Is anyone truly ready for a human to need them with such intensity?"" He chews his bottom lip then looks up at Sherlock. ""Are you?""

""I... I don't know."" Sherlock says softly. ""I want pups with you. I do. I just,"" He sighs. ""I don't think I'd be any good at it..""

""I'm scared too,"" John says after a long pause. He gets up and walks over to Sherlock. Standing beside his chair he leans down and presses his head against the top of Sherlock's head and sighs.

""We can try together? Bring life into this world for you to teach? I can do it, as long as I have you by my side.""

""Together."" Sherlock scoops John up and sets him in his lap, kissing him deeply.

John stops taking his contraceptive that very day. Normally, an Omega would be expected to make an appointment with their Gp to discuss the change in medication. They'd then be subjected to monthly (invasive) appointments to ensure all was working as intended. Luckily for John, he's a doctor and has an Alpha who doesn't care what John does, as long as he's healthy. They approach his next heat with nervous excitement. Mrs. Hudson visits her sister, and they spend three days in the throes of passion. Every day after his next heat, John asks Sherlock if he can smell a change. And every day he's met with a gentle, but sad shake of Sherlock's head. When enough time has passed that he can take a pregnancy test, he knows the answer, even before the test confirms it.

""Nothing,"" he says to Sherlock through the loo door, tossing the stick in the trash. ""Nothing..."" Sitting on the closed toilet lid as Sherlock comes in, he puts his head in his hands and fights back tears.

""I didn't realize how much I wanted this, Sherlock.""

""It's okay."" Sherlock holds John. ""It's okay. This is your first heat off suppressants and contraceptives. So it may take a little time to work out if your system. Besides, it's not unheard of for some couples to go through a few years until they get pregnant. We'll have pups. And until then we just keep doing what we're doing. In the meantime, we can practice new positions and things to help.""

He kisses John's head and rubs his back. ""It'll happen. Stressing about it will only make things harder.""

""I know..."" John says around a sniffle, burying his face into Sherlock's chest. ""You're right. Just another excuse to have sex, yeah?"" 

""I guess,"" John says later, after he's cried himself out, ""this means I want pups. Proof, that we're doing the right thing.""

Sherlock hands him a warm flannel which he gratefully accepts. He washes his face, then smiles. ""That's good, I guess. To find out now instead of finding out I am pregnant and having second thoughts.""

Sherlock smiles softly and nods. ""I think you're right."" He leans in and kisses him tenderly. ""I love you.""

""I love you, Sherlock,"" John says softly while leaning into the kiss. ""So much.""

Sherlock nuzzles him and scoops John up. ""I think we both need a cuddle. And you can drink.""

With the newly discovered void in his life, John begins to find ways to spend his time. One morning, after kissing Sherlock goodbye and telling him not to anger Anderson, John sits alone in the flat. Taking out his mobile he fiddles with the device before following through with his plan


'Any luck looking into bonds like Sherlock and I's? You could check my parent's records. I think they were perfectly matched.'


He hits send and sits back and waits. Unsure if asking Mycroft for help is the smartest choice. Mycroft didn't do things for free, and he wasn't sure what this would cost him in the long run


'Nothing. Just a few old folk tales but no academic work, no proven evidence, I can't even get into files that mention something about the alpha being bitten. The information isn't going to be readily available in the government since it's overrun with alphas who what it squashed and forgotten.-MH'


John fiddles with his phone for a few minutes then sighs. He knows where he can start but it means one of two things. Either he goes back home, roughly a five-hour drive, with Sherlock. Or without.

He has some family back in Lancashire, his mother's Omega sister and a beta brother of his dad's, along with cousins. He hasn't been home since his parent's deaths, having moved with Harry to London when she left for university.

He heads into the bedroom and packs a bag for both himself and Sherlock (just in case) then spends the day tracking down addresses, even going as far as to let Harry know his plans.

Leave a comment and let us know what you think! -Accident

I think this is why I love omegaverse so much. A half Holmes half Watson child would be unstopable. Certainly, even an adopted child raised by them would be as well, but there's something special about their biological child in my book. And this is coming from a woman who doesn't want/can't have kids LOL -Tindo

John takes Sherlock to the village where he grew up...

Enjoy!

Note from Tindo: I know nothing about the location in England I set at John's hometown. Please be kind to me in the upcoming chapters. If it helps, picture him in a fictional town.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Sherlock bounds up the stairs. ""John! John! Anderson slipped in a puddle of blood! I have pictures!"" He grins as he comes inside.

His grinning is soon replaced with a confused face and then a pained one. ""Are you leaving?"" His voice cracks, looking at the bags John had packed. ""What did I do? I can fix it. Whatever I did I can fix it, John. I promise. Just don't leave. You don't need to leave."" He says, feeling panicked and distressed.

Instantly John goes to Sherlock's side and soothes his hands up and down Sherlock's arms.

""Hush love, one of them is for you.""

He quickly explains the text from Mycroft and his fear that Mycroft won't be successful in helping them learn more about their bond.

""I was going to visit family in the morning and pick their brain about my parents. Thought you might like to come."" He finishes, motioning to one of the cases.

""Oh. Oh. Thank goodness."" Sherlock pulls John into his arms and scents John heavily.

""I couldn't ever leave you. Not willing at least."" John says softly. ""You're my other half. But I also wasn't going to force you into a cramped car for the better part of the day just to go sit and chat with my cranky relatives.""

""I know. I'm sorry. I just.. panicked."" Sherlock nuzzles him. ""Of course I want to go with you. They may tell me things about you from when you were younger. I won't miss that opportunity."" He grins.

""Git,"" John says fondly, looking over at the bags. ""It's only noon... we could be there by evening? No, I told them we'd be there tomorrow, already made reservations for a room.""

He stops, remembering what Sherlock had said about Anderson, and reaches for Sherlock's mobile.

""Show me?"" he giggles.

""Whenever you'd like."" Sherlock nods and brings up the pictures, laughing as he looks at them before handing his phone to John.

Anderson was lying face first in a pool of blood, a smear mark around the edge where he slipped. There's a few more pictures where he's trying to get up but ends up slipping onto his back. ""Those are priceless,"" John says, gasping for breath through his laughter.

The next morning the flat is a whirlwind of activity. With Sherlock forwarding case-solving information over to Lestrade, and John making sure they aren't forgetting anything. Sherlock pouts a bit, sad he won't be there to see the end of the case; a murderous wife who'd dismembered her husband for cheating., only slightly disappointed he won't be there to see the murderous wife arrested. They rent a car, rather than taking the train, and John slips behind the wheel with a grin. His new license is finally getting put to use.

""I should warn you,"" he says after they've been driving for a while. ""My aunt is one of those Omegas who's been cowed by her family into a shell of a life. Her Alpha is a decent man, treats her right if not a bit controlling... but Mum and her sister didn't have the best life as Omega kids...""

Sherlock frowns. ""Were they abused?"" He asks softly. He often wonders about John's parents, if they were like him and John. Soulmates. A perfect match. He wonders what it's like to be raised by parents who were a perfect match.

""Not sure,"" John gives a half shrug and shakes his head. ""Emotional abuse, perhaps? Mum didn't take us to see her parents often. She has an Alpha sister whom I've never met. I've just seen pictures of her and her family.""

""I've been wondering,"" he said softly, ""How mum and dad met, you know? I never thought much about dad's bite... it was, here,"" John points to the area when the shoulder meets the neck and shrugs again, ""Dad always wore a shirt, so we didn't see it often. Only if out swimming, whenever the weather decided to be warm enough for that. But, they loved each other, you know? It wasn't just a bond forced on my mum. She truly cared. When he got sick... Harry and I watched the life leave her eyes.""

""I'm sorry, John,"" Sherlock says softly, resting his hand on John's thigh. ""They only had you and Harry?""

""Mm."" John nods, ""We never found that odd as kids. It just was how it was. But I do remember my Aunt scolding mum for not having more. But she and dad were happy with us.""

""Large families never made sense to me. Anything over six feels overwhelming. And I hate how some people let their oldest kids raise the youngest while they keep breeding. It's horrible."" Sherlock sighs. ""My parents only had two as well but I think it was because I was such a hand full they didn't want to risk another like me."" He hums.

""Tell me about them? Your Mum and Dad? I want to know everything I can about you."" Sherlock prods.

""Mum's name was Joann, Dad's Harrison,"" John says, waiting for Sherlock to laugh at the originality of his and his sister's names.

Sherlock chuckles softly. ""Sherlock is a girl's name."" He smiles at John. ""I think that's nice. Named after your parents.""

""Sherlock is not a girl's name."" John laughs but then smiles at his mate.

""I got Mum's looks. Harry somehow came out an even split. She has dad's eyes and nose. Not sure where her attitude comes from. Neither of our parents were arseholes. Maybe it's just the Alpha in her?"" John sighs and slips into a shortened version of his life story. Telling Sherlock about the family trips, Christmas holidays spent bundled up by the fireplace, and everything he could remember about his parent's relationship. Ending with, ""they were more than the Alpha dad and Omega mother... They were home if that makes sense.""

Sherlock listens intently, taking in every bit of information John gives. He memorizes everything and files it away ""I think it does. I.. I'd like to be that four our pups."" He says softly.

Growing up for him wasn't exactly cold but it wasn't overly warm either. He wanted his pups to know they were loved and wanted. That their parents adored them.

""Me too, and I think they'll have that. I mean, we're choosing to have them. We want them. That must mean something, yeah?""

The ride is long, but the scenery beautiful. They stop a few times to let Sherlock stretch, and John let's Sherlock finish the last leg of the journey so he can watch once familiar landscape drift past them. Nearing the center of town he points to a small inn. ""I've made reservations there, if you want to stop so I can use the loo.""

""It does. We want them. We're choosing them. Our pups."" Sherlock nods and pulls into the inn. ""We can check in and put our bags away."" He finds a spot and parks the car, following John into the office.

""What can I do for you sir?"" A man behind the counter looks at Sherlock, ignoring John.

""My mate made a reservation."" Sherlock hums.

""What's the name?"" He turns to the computer.

""Watson,"" John says flatly, staring at the prick behind the counter. ""But you already knew that, didn't you Pete? Still mad I wouldn't let you fuck me behind the school?""

He feels Sherlock stiffen beside him. Silver Blue eyes fixate on Pete, and John sits back and waits for the explosion of information with a smug grin on his face.

""Pete, Alpha. You've tried unsuccessfully to gain the attention of three, no four Omegas. You've struck out each time, due to your erectile dysfunction, shameful, in an Alpha your age. You spend your time growing and cultivating marijuana plants on the family farm, selling the leaves illegally under the local coppers' nose. I think I'll have a chat with them after we've checked in. Would you be kind enough to introduce me, John?""

John covers his mouth with his hand and tries his best not to laugh. ""Yeah, of course.""

Sherlock snatched up the key when it's offered in a trembling hand. He gives one last glare before following John out. ""What an arsehole."" He grumbles as they go and get their bags.

He helps John carry their things inside after unlocking the door. ""I'm sorry you have to deal with people like him.""

""Oh yeah this town is full of charming people,"" John says, tossing his bag on the bed.

""Everyone here knows me as Harrison's Omega son. Aside from my aunt, not sure anyone knows or cares about the years I spent in the military. Hell, no one even knows I'm a bloody doctor.""

Sherlock frowns. ""I'll just shove it in their faces then.""

He starts to unpack when something occurs to him. ""The erectile dysfunction. I could see the signs like normal but I could.. smell it?"" He looks at John confused. ""Omega's can smell that?""

""Wait!"" John stops unpacking and turns to Sherlock with an incredulous look on his face. ""You can't? Normally?""

""Nope."" Sherlock pops the 'p' and shakes his head. ""I suppose it's a biological advantage for omega's. Picking a mate whose cock actually works.""

""Oh, that's not it at all. At least, not for me."" John says, sitting on the edge of the bed while watching his mate.

""Oftentimes Erectile Dysfunction comes from the person's subconscious. Men, who have grown up in overly religious families, being taught that masturbation or sex before bonding is wrong. Yet, being blokes with a working body, they give it a shot. Guilt creeps up on them, even if they don't realize it, making it hard to maintain a hardon.""

John scrunches his face up, remembering the acrid scent coming off Pete in waves. ""Us Omegas have learned to see it as A person with something to hide. and that usually is a good enough reason to make sure you're never alone with them.""

""Ohh."" Sherlock nods, finishing unpacking. ""You grew up religious? Or is this just a heavily religious town?"" He sits next to John.

""Small town, more... superstitious than religious. But, yeah, we went to church. Some of us more than others. My family just did the major holidays, or if mum and dad got into a spat and they felt guilty."" John clarifies while pressing his weight against Sherlock's shoulder.

Sherlock wraps his arm around John and holds him close, nuzzling his hair. ""Sometimes it surprises me how different we grew up.""

""Mmm, I was allowed free reign of pretty much this whole town, until I presented."" John sighs. Sherlock's scents help override the dull chemical scent used to deodorize the rooms between guests. The air purifier in the corner hums, which reminds him of something he'd been meaning to bring up.

""Sherlock, with my sister back in my life, and your brother never leaving yours, and clients. We should get an air purifier in the lounge. Something we can turn on when other people come over so it isn't overwhelming. Come winter, we won't be able to open the windows as often. Not without freezing ourselves out.""

Sherlock sighs and nods. ""You're right. Only for the common areas though. I want our room to smell like us."" He kisses John's head.

""Mm."" John agrees, then looks out the window and takes in the town he'd grown up in. ""Why don't we start with my mom's sister, Jennie? With any luck, they'll invite us to dinner and embarrass me by showing you pictures of me as a kid. I went through a stage where I refused to wear shirts for an entire summer. Mum gave up trying, and just made me wear dungarees.""

Sherlock grins. ""I want copies."" He chuckles and kisses John soundly.

John takes Sherlock to meet his Aunt...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

When they were ready to go Sherlock followed John out, ignoring the odd looks they got from passers-by because he wasn't driving. ""They know we're coming, right?"" He asks, the people they pass watching. He hated small towns for that reason. ""Everyone seems to know we're here..""

""Yup... after we found out I wasn't pregnant I called my aunt. She said to come up any time, and when I suggested we visit now, she didn't object.""

John glowers at the people watching and contemplates backing up into Pete's truck. ""Still driving that piece of crap his grandfather left him...."" John rolls his eyes and grunts, ""We're in England, he doesn't even live on a farm, what's he need a damned truck for?""

""Compensating."" Sherlock snorts and smirks.

""That reminds me..."" John groans and leans his forehead against the steering wheel before exiting the car park.

""We'll be asked about pups, and how many we want? When we'll be having them..."" He groans again and hits his head against the wheel a few times.

""We can tell them it's none of their business. Or we're waiting. Or that you have a few loads of my cum plugged up inside you as we speak."" Sherlock rubs John's back. ""Or we don't have to say anything.""

""Sherlock,"" John says, turning to look at his mate. ""There's something you need to know before we get there. The last time I was here... My mum had just died. Harry had taken over sole ownership of me, and she was moving us to London so she could attend uni. My aunt offered to let me stay with her and her Alpha, and said she'd help me get a good Alpha so I could settle down and spread my roots.""

Sucking in a deep breath he closes his eyes, remembering with striking clarity how vicious he'd been at the time. ""I told everyone off, swore to them that I'd never bond. That I'd rather drive into the ocean than bond. I... didn't know I'd meet you then.""

""John, you're allowed to change your mind. And if anything you probably wouldn't have bonded with anyone. I just happened to be your soulmate as well as being charming and handsome and brilliant. Really you couldn't have turned me down if you tried."" Sherlock smiles softly, gently teasing.

""Charming?"" John says, turning his head to fix Sherlock with a single arched eyebrow. ""I think we have a different definition of the word charming, love."" He smiles over at his mate then rolls his eyes at Sherlock's smirk.

""Right... Off to Aunt Jennie's we go.""

John rubbernecks as they drive through the town, pointing out old shops, or empty buildings where shops used to be. They pass a park and he slows down and glances out his window with a grin. ""I used to play there every day. We only lived a few streets away, mum would let me walk or take my bicycle.""

""Causing all kinds of mayhem I'm sure."" Sherlock chuckles, imagining John as a small boy running around with a pack of friends.

""Who? Me?"" John pretends to be appalled at the accusation, ""I was an angel.""

Unable to keep a straight face he bursts out laughing. ""This one time, I'd gotten ahold of a bottle of vinegar. One of those giant gallon bottles restaurants get. My friend Winston and I made the biggest paper mache volcano we could manage, and about three boxes of baking soda. We mixed in a god-awful amount of orange food colouring with the vinegar. It was raining out, so we set the thing off on my mum's white carpet. I couldn't sit down for a week.""

Sherlock chuckles. ""At least you didn't break every window in your house twice during the course of one summer.""

""I don't think I want to know,"" John replies as he continues to drive.

After a minute or two, they pass a street and John frowns. ""That... that was my street. Not sure I can see the house. Not right now. My Aunt lives right up here anyways...""

A few minutes later they pull up in front of a small home. Large hedges line the borders, proving privacy from the close-quarter neighbors. Kids play out on the lawn and look up when the car pulls into the drive. One of them runs in, clearly to tell an adult that ""Someone is here"" and by the time John has the car in park, a round woman steps out, three small children no older than five trails behind her.

""Good God, they can't be hers... I have cousins only a few years younger than me."" John whispers as he pushes the door open and steps out.

Sherlock follows John, observing the gaggle of children and the woman.

""Hi, Aunty,"" John calls out to the woman. It takes her a moment to recognize him as a grown man, but she recovers quickly and steps forward to pull him into her arms.

""Where's Harry?"" She says, looking at the car, then at the man standing beside it. ""You said you'd bring her?""

""No,"" John says carefully, ""I said I would bring my Alpha. Aunty, meet my mate Sherlock.""

Jennie's eyes dart to John's neck, then John can smell the happiness on the woman as she puts two and two together. She releases John and goes to Sherlock. John half expects her to pull him into a bearhug, but instead, she simply thrusts out a hand for Sherlock to shake.

""A pleasure to meet you, Ma'am."" Sherlock shakes her hand, firm but gentle, and bows his head, an obvious sign of respect which is rare for an alpha to give an omega.

""Oh you got bagged by a polite one,"" Jennie says with a chuckle.

John catches Sherlock's eyes and with a shake of his head warns Sherlock not to argue or correct her.

""He's great,"" he says simply, then looks around at the kids playing. ""These aren't all yours, are they?""

""Oh goodness no!"" She laughs, rubbing the head of a toddler as he runs past. ""I run a sort of daycare, for those poor Omegas who have to work.""

""It's nice that they have someplace to be looked after."" Sherlock hums, following John and his Aunt inside the fenced-in yard.

""That it is,"" she agrees as she bustles to the door, ""Why don't you come in, you too John.""

""Yeah, I was sort of planning on it,"" John says with a roll of his eyes. ""Ta..""

Sherlock has to dodge a few children running around, nearly stepping on a few under his long legs. He walks through the yard like it's a minefield and finally makes it inside after John.

The house smells like nappy cream and something fruity. It instantly sets John back twenty some odd years to when he used to visit with his mother just after his aunt had given birth to her third.

""Still the same,"" he smiles, looking at the pictures on the wall as they walk through the hall towards the kitchen in the back. ""Frank looks great,"" he commented as he passed a recent family portrait.

""Uncle Frank, John."" She scolds but John just sticks a hand out, his fingers and thumb straight, and flaps them about, mouthing ""Blah Blah Blah"" to Sherlock.

Sherlock chuckles softly, looking at the pictures and taking in the house. It was obvious by John's aunt's hips that she had quite a few children herself and she still surrounds herself with pups.

""You run this daycare all by yourself?"" Sherlock asks, noting that most of the children seemed well behaved and were entertaining themselves.

""I do."" She says proudly, motioning John and Sherlock to sit at the table. ""Children born from an Omega are usually quite docile. Don't know where your mum went wrong with you two,"" she says, casting a look over to John who suddenly felt like a child being scolded for pinching a pastry before dinner.

""She didn't go wrong, she let us have fun.""

Sherlock rests his hand in John's thigh to comfort him. ""I'm sure John was a model child compared to me.""

""All the windows? Twice?"" He asks, turning to Sherlock with a laugh. ""Good god, Sherlock. You were a right terror, weren't you? I mean, you still are, so I guess that shouldn't surprise me.""

""John Watson"" his aunt shot out in a stern tone, ""We do not talk to our Alpha's like that."" Turning to Sherlock she dips her head in apology, ""Sorry if I offended you. I don't know your last name, but I assume John took it when you bonded.""

""Actually we hyphenated. Holmes-Watson. I insisted."" Sherlock nods, letting the weight of his words settle.

""Watson-Holmes still sounds better,"" John mutters playfully, nudging Sherlock's foot under the table. ""Aunty, he doesn't make me live in his shadow, so stop scolding me like I'm a child. If he takes offense by anything anyone does, he'll be the first to say so. Trust me on that one.""

John toys with a baby spoon on the table then he turns to his aunt. ""We're sort of here for answers, actually. Remember how Dad had that bite on his neck? Well, when Sherlock and I bonded it just felt right to give him one. It's given us this weird... joint bond. We're in each other's heads. Hell, he smelled Pete's problem when we checked into the inn because of our bond. Is there anything you can tell me about my parents' bond?""

John watches carefully as his aunt turns her back to them and begins making tea. He looks at Sherlock out of the corner of his eyes and notices him watching her with slanted eyes.

""You know what it means but you're trying to think of a lie that's convincing. We're all adults here. Bonded adults. We don't need to be treated like children. We've shown you nothing but respect and we'd like the same in return. Tell us what you know. It's much easier than having to deduce it."" Sherlock says, starting to get annoyed with her behavior.

""My sister was so proud of herself when she announced she and Hank had bonded,"" she says, setting the kettle down on the stove with a bit too much force. ""Came home to back her bags, bright red bite on her neck. We hadn't heard from her in four days. Our parents had gone to the police and everything. Thought someone snatched her just before her heat.""

Jennie sighs and picks at a frayed corner of a tea towel before turning to face the two men sitting at her table.

""She knew her heat was coming and knew our parents were in the beginning stages of an agreement with an Alpha who wanted my sister. So she ran off with Him and they spent half a week in a tent by the ocean fucking. She got pregnant with Harry because of that little stunt, preventing the other Alpha from laying his claim on her because he didn't want to raise some other Alpha's whelp.""

John shifts uncomfortably as he listens to his aunt. Her words were strained, and her wording made him think there was no small amount of anger being held back.

""She told me about her bonding, as she packed. Eyes bright with the wonder of her new life. Told me how she'd bitten him, and how they now shared one soul.""

Twitching her nose she stops short and glares at her nephew. ""But that's all I'll say. We've been warned not to talk about it, and I suggest you don't go about town asking about your dad's bond bite. You'll find people won't be as friendly with you if you do.""

""So you pumped out half a dozen pups trying to feel the same happiness your sister had gotten seemingly so easy and failed?"" Sherlock asks, waves of irritation coming off him. ""Instead of being bitter and jealous, you should have been happy for her. For her happiness. That she found the one person who could complete her. This."" He opens his collar and shows his bite. ""This is world-changing. Breathtaking. And I pity you for never being able to experience it but that doesn't mean you get to be horrible to John for something that happened before he was born.""

The air crackles around John as he watches his aunt, a person who believed her kinship provided her household with some small sliver of authority over John's life and his mate. He could feel Sherlock's anger and was in no position himself to send calming signals across the bond. All he could do was hope and pray his uncle wouldn't show up while everyone's hackles were still raised.

After a few minutes of the staredown, John clears his throat and nods at the kettle. The whistle had been taken out of the device, no doubt removed by his aunt after an untimely cup of tea had awakened one of the many children now taking up space, albeit temporary, in her house.

""Mum was happy,"" John says softly, ""Dad was happy too, and he provided the best life for all of us.""

""Until he went and killed himself."" Jennie spits

""He got sick,"" John growls, ""a heart attack isn't killing oneself.""

""I think that's quite enough for today."" Sherlock stands, rising to his full height.

John agrees and shows it by storming out of the house. Though his dramatic exit is slightly dampened by having to step over toys and children. Making it to the car first he pulls open the passenger's door and collapses inside. When Sherlock sits in the driver's seat he hands the keys over and closes his eyes.

""She's a bitch."" John hisses, gripping his bad leg and willing the phantom stab of pain to go away. ""Why didn't I see it before? Not allowed to play with my own cousins, despite living within walking. distance?""

""It's not your fault she's bitter and jealous. She saw my bite the minute she shook my hand. It set her off from the start."" Sherlock starts the car and makes sure there were no children around before pulling out of the drive.

He rests his hand on John's thigh and rubs it gently. ""I'm sorry it didn't go well. I know you were hoping for information about your parents. I.."" He thinks. ""What happened to all the things in your parent's house? Are they still there?""

John chews his lip for a moment then gives Sherlock a noncommittal grunt.

""Harry took care of that... I was a bit too upended by the whole thing to care. I'll ask her.""

Pulling his mobile out he shoots his sister a text then points to a road. ""Go left, I want to go scream into the surf.""

At first I wanted to like John's aunt. But by the end of this chapter we realized nope, she's a bitch.

The boys go to John's parent's house...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Harry texts John back that she sold the non sentimental things and most of the furniture. Everything else was still locked up in the house since they didn't have anywhere to put it when she was in uni. 

Sherlock nods and follows John's directions. Soon he parks in a lot by the sand and follows John out over the dunes.

Kicking his shoes and socks off John leaves them at the edge of the beach and walks down to where the dry sand met wet. He sits and puts his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands.

""I don't love being back here. I hate the looks, I hate her. I hate that I can't just go knock on the door and see my parents.""

""I'm sorry, John."" Sherlock sits next to him in the sand.

""It's fine."" John says softly, watching the water. The beach wasn't pretty by most people's standards. It was more rock and dangerous channels than it was lapping waves. Heck, there was a sign warning people of quicksand not far down the road. But this had been John's home for half his life. 

""I used to come down here and snog."" John said, turning to Sherlock with a shy smile on his face, ""Sherlock Holmes would you like to have a snog in the sand?""

""John, do you even have to ask?"" Sherlock smiles softly and pulls John close.

""No, I don't. I could just rip your clothes off and have you now, but the tied comes in fast... So maybe save that for later?""

Smirking John gets up off the sand and sits across Sherlock's lap, his arse on Sherlock's thighs and feet in the rocky sand behind Sherlock's back. Wrapping his arms around Sherlock's neck he leans in and presses his lips against his mate's cheek, then chin, then their lips find each other.

Sherlock holds John close, running his hands over his omega's back. He kisses John deeply, teasingly sliding his tongue along John's as the waves wash up and down the sand. 

He nips at John's lips and rocks against him teasingly.

John begins to relax under Sherlock's gentle care. His mate washes away the anger, replacing it with untainted love.

After what felt like ages, his lips sore, and Sherlock's legs certainly asleep, he got up and offered Sherlock a hand up.

""Let's go see my house. If Harry didn't move the spare key, I can get us in.""

""I can always pick the lock."" Sherlock takes John's hand and leads him back to the car, making sure they get their shoes. 

He follows John's directions and drives them to the house.

They sit in the driveway for a long moment before John opens the door steps out barefoot. The house is abandoned, but not  falling apart. Someone had been looking after it, and something told him it wasn't his aunt. 

""Harry must be paying someone to keep an eye on it."" John mused, thinking that perhaps it wouldn't hurt for him to offer to chip in once in a while.

""This way,"" he says, walking through a gate to the back garden. 

His feet carry him over familiar ground without thought. He goes to the back corner of the garden, the furthest point of the house, and lifts up a garden gnome. There, sitting in a waterproof case, is a silver key. Grinning he scoops it up and wiggles his toes in the grass. After a moment of that, he heads to the back door and slips the key into the lock.

The door opens easily, and they enter into a small room. ""Mud room, we used to call it. Because well, I might have covered every inch of that wall in mud when I was five."" John said, pointing to the wall facing the garden. 

""Kitchen is through here. What do you think we should look for?""

Sherlock hums as he looks around. ""Look for albums and pictures first. If we're lucky maybe one of your parents kept a journal.""

""Right."" 

The kitchen still smelled like home to John. Hints of his mother's favourite tea and her perfume still lingered, though it was nearly so faint he couldn't pick it out. 

Running his hands along the old table, he looked around the room and smiled sadly at a picture hung on the wall. It was the four of them, as a family. Harry looked to be about nine, while John was only six. He remembered that day, being forced to wear a suit with one of those clips on ties. His mother smiled down at him, while his father smiled over at his wife. 

""He never looked at the camera."" John said, nodding to the picture. ""Only had eyes for mum.""

Sherlock wraps his arm around John's waist as he looks at the picture, holding John close. ""I wish I could have met them..""

""Me too,"" John says softly, then tugs Sherlock through a door into the living room. He tests a light and hums in surprise when the bulb sputters on, then notices that the furniture is free of dust. 

He looks down at his fingers then frowns.

""I ran my hand over the table. No dust,"" he says, holding his fingers up. ""There isn't a speck of dust anywhere. Why is this place so bloody clean? And the powers on?""

Sherlock frowns. ""Someone's been here. Recently."" He sniffs but can't smell anyone else in the house now. ""Harry wouldn't have hired a cleaning company, she can barely keep her own affairs in order let one this place. Maybe your aunt since she knew we were coming?""

""No,"" John shakes his head and frowns, ""you saw the way she talked about my parents. She wouldn't dare step into their home."" 

John focuses on the room, for a moment worried that he'd just broken into someone's home, thinking someone else now lived here. But the pictures on the wall were still of his family, and his mother's blanket was still draped over the sofa. He brings the blanket up to his nose and sniffs. 

""This has been laundered. Recently. Sherlock, there isn't that musty scent that comes with abandoned houses. As far as I'm aware, Harry hasn't been up here in at least two years. Possibly longer. There aren't any cobwebs, or signs of mice... What the fuck is going on?""

Sherlock frowns and strands in the center of the room, slowly turning and taking everything in. ""The house has been searched already."" He says finally. 

""Some of the pictures were just the slightest bit off center. That chair has been moved from the opposite corner of the room.."" He lists subtle changes. ""Fucking Mycroft."" He hisses. ""He must have sent someone to look through the house.""

""Ohh..."" John sighs, but relaxes. The thought of someone playing house in his family home had upset him more than he was willing to admit. As much as he didn't love Sherlock's brother, he was relieved to think that it had been him, or his underlings, who had cleaned up.

""Almost nice of him, leaving the power on. Like he knew we'd come.""

""Nosy prick."" Sherlock sighs. ""Either they didn't find anything or they did and he's keeping it to himself."" He frowns. 

""John, if you wanted to hide something that you didn't want found where would you put it?""

""My mum never let us under her bed."" John said after a moment's thought. ""Harry and I used to play hide and seek, but we weren't allowed to hide under their bed."" 

""Bedroom?"" Sherlock asks, already heading towards the stairs.

""Up the stairs, first door on the left.""

John watches Sherlock bound up the stairs. But he stays in the lounge, turning in a small circle and looking around the room.

""I want my kids to have this. A home, a place to be happy."" he said softly, then sits down on the sofa and holds his mother's blanket close to his face.

Sherlock searches John's parents room, he looks at the pictures on the walls and what sort of people John's parents were. He inspects the floor where John's parents bed where, crawling on his hands and knees. 

He feels the floorboards, testing for any loose ones, and knocks on them to see if there's a hollow sound. He gets to a panel that would have been on John's father's side of the bed and it wiggles just slightly. 

It takes Sherlock a minute to get it up but the panel comes loose and he pulls out his phone. When he turns on the light he sees a stash of papers. ""John!"" He calls out.

Sherlock's voice pulls John from his reverie. Placing his mother's blanket back on the sofa he hurries up the stairs, ignoring the echoes of laughter and his mother singing. He finds Sherlock on his knees beside the bed. His back is to the door, so it isn't until John steps into the room and walks to Sherlock that he sees the papers.

""What is that? Oh god, if you tell me they're love letters I will throw up.""

""Well some of them are. And there's some photos that you probably shouldn't see."" Sherlock chuckles softly. ""But look. He, your father. He was digging as well."" He hands John some papers as he reaches deeper into the floor.

""Digging?"" John asks, then his jaw drops open when Sherlock hands him a stack. 

Written in his father's hand were the words ""Soulmate?"" and ""How it should be.""

Posting from my phone so I didn't do a quick once over for typos. Sorry!!

Boom...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""He knew... I mean, yeah he knew. We can feel it. But he was searching for more like us?"" John asks, leafing through the papers and reading snippets of his dad's research. ""What else is in there, except... god, sex pictures? Gross.""

""They're quite tasteful."" Sherlock hums as he looks at the pictures.

""Oi!"" John yelps, shoving a palm against Sherlock's shoulder. ""Stop looking at my mum while humming."" He laughs, and tries to yank the picture free without looking at it, but ends up getting an eyeful anyway.

""Gross, put that back. I don't need to know that my mum had sex.""

""I won't tell you that you have her arse then."" Sherlock chuckles and puts the pictures away, looking through the letters.

""Fuck off,"" John says fondly, shoving Sherlock a bit with his hip.

""Christ, they took those while me and Harry were just down the hall."" He pinches the bridge of his nose then sighs, accepting the fact that his parents were as madly in love as he and Sherlock were. ""I guess, I can't blame them. When you're looking up at me while I'm on top... I want to freeze the moment and remember the expression you get. It's half dorky, half wonder. I love it.""

""We can talk pictures if you want. Video even. Up to you."" Sherlock smirks. ""Just goes to show it's possible to have an active adventurous sex life while being parents."" He smiles.

""Alright right, enough about my parent's sex life thank you. What else is in my dad's hole."" John groans and slaps his hand over his face, instantly regretting his choice of words. ""The hole in the floor... I mean.""

Sherlock bursts into loud roaring laughter, curled up on the floor and holding his stomach from laughing so hard. ""His.."" He laughs. ""Hole!""

John hip checks his mate but ends up joining Sherlock on the floor laughing. He sits with his back against his parent's bed and laughs until tears come to his eyes.

""I guess I haven't magically inherited your eloquent way of words. Left that part out of the bond sharing experience, did you?""

Sherlock giggles and kisses John happily. ""You're perfect."" He kisses him again.

""Snogging in my parent's room feels a bit dirty."" John says, shifting closer. ""But, seeing how they have a secret cubby full of softcore porn, and secret research... I think they'd approve.""

""I should hope so. They'd probably be proud we found each other. Found our own soulmates. It just goes to prove everything they were trying to do."" Sherlock hums.

""Would snogging in your old room be more or less dirty?"" He nuzzles him.

""Oh yes, on my single-person bed, built for a kid, not a grown man. Brilliant idea."" John laughs then pulls away and glares at him. ""Wait, you just want to go see my room. Don't you?""

""Maybe but I also want to kiss you, so."" Sherlock shrugs. ""Besides I know kissing in here turns you on."" He smirks. ""It feels dirty and like we could get caught.""

""Feels like at any moment someone's going to walk in and catch me with my hands down my pants."" John says around a slow kiss. ""Come on, come see my room. I'm curious to see what Harry left, and what she boxed up.""

Standing John leads the way down the hall and pauses at the door. ""I took a lot of it with me when we moved, it's probably just old posters, maybe some action figures..."" he shrugs and pushes the door open.

The room instantly smells like home to him. His tiny bed is pushed against one wall, beside it is a desk where he used to do his homework. Star Wars posters line the walls and there's a partially empty bookcase sitting beside the door. John turns the light on and steps inside, letting Sherlock follow him in.

""Pretty bare..."" he says softly, though in his eyes he can see the room how it used to be. ""Figured out how to have my first wank in that bed, so I guess that's something.""

""Care to reenact it for me?"" Sherlock teases as he looks around.

""Why, have you taken up a sudden interest in the sturdiness of bed frames made in the 70's?"" John asks with a smirk while moving to sit on his old bed.

""Because I could show you if you'd like. Or you can get their hands-on experience.""

""Mmm yes please."" Sherlock grins and kneels in front of John.

It never ceases to amaze John just how fast the two of them can go from fully clothed to stark naked. In less than thirty seconds his and Sherlock's clothing lay piled on the floor and John stretched out against his old bed. His feet hang off the edge, making him giggle at the absurdity. Sherlock watches, eyes bright and hungry, as John reaches down and begins to stroke his cock.

""Watch me, Sherlock."" he says softly as he begins to toy with his own cock.

It's nothing like the fast desperate wanks he used to have in this bed. He knows what he likes by now. Knows how to swipe his fingers over the glans, and apply pressure at the base. It isn't just yanking and hoping for the best. Sherlock's eyes are pools of silver above him. He reaches out and slides his hand over Sherlock's stomach then lets out a surprised sigh as a trickle of slick makes its way out of him.

""Fuck me,"" he says firmly, lifting his legs and wrapping them around Sherlock's hips. ""I need you inside me. Please?""

""Needy omega."" Sherlock chuckles and it would sound more convincing if his cock wasn't leaking already. He holds John's hips and sinks his cock into John, groaning. ""Slick. So slick for me.""

John groans and pushes against Sherlock. He'd expected Sherlock to be met with some resistance. Between heats like this, it shouldn't be possible to have effortless sex with an Alpha's cock. And there certainly should not be any slick. But his body is pleasantly receptive, and instead of questioning it he pushes in and lets Sherlock sink deep inside him.

""Always need you, Sherlock,"" he says ""Always.""

Sherlock kisses John deeply, holding him close and rocking his hips, pressing deep into his omegas. He knew logically that it shouldn't be this easy to fuck John outside of a heat but his alpha side is enjoying being inside his omega.

""I'm here. All yours. Always."" Sherlock kisses and sucks on his bond mark.

The bed is too small for both of them, and the frame creaks ominously beneath them. But that doesn't slow either of them down. John coaxes his Alpha along, hands clawing at any part of Sherlock he can reach.

""Teeth..."" John hisses, presenting his neck to his Alpha. ""please, Sherlock.""

Sherlock gives into his omega's wants, giving John his bite as his thrusts rub his omega's prostate. John's climax crashes around him too fast. He feels like he's barely gotten Sherlock where he wants him when it happens. Too soon, but somehow perfect at the same time. Hot and heavy with a promise of more later. With a cry he raises his hips and pushes hard against Sherlock, missing the knot but full and happy. His muscles clamp down around Sherlock's cock as he lets out a cry of pleasure so loud it echoes off the walls. Come pools on his stomach and he begins to shake, begging Sherlock through his tremors.

""Come in me please. Fill me up. Only you, Sherlock.""

Sherlock thrusts a handful more times and comes hard into John, filling him with cum.

They sprawl on the bed as best they can, and John tries his hardest not to make a mess on his old blankets. After a while, when a mess becomes inevitable, Sherlock goes off in search of something for John to clean up with. He comes back with a bog roll and tosses it apologetically to John. After cleaning up John sits up and cocks his, tilting his neck side to side. Touching his bite he frowns and says, ""doesn't feel any different. Can you see it? Are there new teeth marks?""

Sherlock shakes his head. ""It's already disappearing.""

""Everything we do goes against everything I was programed to expect."" John says softly.""I didn't just want you to bite me. I needed it. We should go read what my dad wrote. I wonder if he and mum noticed this... This bite thing."" He says for lack of a better way to explain it.

Sherlock nods and helps John clean up before getting them dressed again. He follows John back to the room, giving John his father's notes to go through, and then goes through his parent's letters to see if there's anything in there. John curls up on his parent's bed and goes through the notes. Unorganized, as was his dad's habit, it's hard to decipher at first. But he spreads the pages out on the bed and begins putting them into some form of order. He finds two pages full of the same questions John has. Questions about the limit of their bond, why their children seem happier than others, about the instinct to bite and be bitten during sex. It goes on and on leaving John wide eyed. Only some of the questions have answers. He finds them on pages with numbers circled in the corner. The number corresponds to the number question it's answering. He finds a page with his and Harry's names written all over it and settles in to read. He reads silently at first. Then out loud as he reads his dad's theory.

""We often wondered why Harry and John never displayed the docile behavior most toddlers born from an Omega have. From the start Harriot was a spitfire, full of life and lungs ready to tell you just how bored she was.


John on the other hand used his lungs for a purpose. He was curious to the point of driving his mother and I mental. Everything was 'why' or 'what's that'. Our children were the talk of the town, and we considered strange parents.


We even thought ourselves strange until we found another couple with a few children all displaying the same 'loving life' behaviours. It was summer time, and we were at the Ocean. I saw their joint bites and introduced myself.""

""Sherlock... were you listening?"" John asks, flipping the page over to see if there was more. Not finding anything he brings flipping through the other pages to see if his dad had continued the story on another page.

""Hmm?"" Sherlock asks, reading through the letters. They were more personal, about feelings and desires. Life plans. How John's parents decided to run away together for John's mother's heat so they could bond and be together.

""Dad found another couple like them. He thinks there might be some link to the whole soulmate thing and children's behaviours... Not sure. It's mostly his thoughts written down so it's hard to decipher. ""

He sits up a bit and scrubs his hand over his face.

""But remember what my aunt said? Omega's children are docile? I guess Harry and I weren't. Sounds like we were anything but."" He holds the paper out to Sherlock and begins skimming over another one.

""Maybe we can track down the other couple somehow? Are there names or descriptions?"" Sherlock reads.

""From the letters, your dad knew right away that your mum was the one. He says it over and over. She was scared at first. Of what she felt for him. Afraid to admit it because of her family. She was actually the one that suggested they run away a bond."" He hums.

""Why the children? What would soulmate parents have bolder and louder children?"" He frowns as he reads through the papers.

""Maybe because they aren't born into a world of submission?"" John theorizes, glancing up from the papers to his mate. ""Children learn from their parents actions as much as they do from spoken word. And good God, are you saying our children will be bolder and louder than you""

""I'm pretty hard to beat."" Sherlock chuckles. ""I think you're right. Children learn mostly from their omega's in formative years. If the omega is made to be docile and quiet the children will also emulate that. Especially if the alpha is overpowering.""

John hums and nods as he pours over the stack of papers. Afternoon turns to evening and John's stomach begins to growl. He doesn't want to take his eyes off of his dad's work, but he looks up at Sherlock.

""Small town, everything closes early. If we want a chance at dinner we should think about leaving soon. Plus I'd love to walk into the Inn smelling of sex and see the look on Pete's face.""

""We can take the papers with us."" Sherlock nods, his own stomach feeling hungry because of their connection.

""Come on,"" John stands from his parent's bed and carefully picks up the papers from the bed. ""There's a place on our way back. We can get dinner, and I can get a beer.""

Sherlock nods and finds a briefcase in the closet for the papers to go in.

Placing the papers in the briefcase John looks around the room and sighs.

""I'm glad we came here. It's nice to smell home again.""

""We can come back whenever you'd like."" Sherlock rubs John's arm.

John locks up the house and pockets the key, intending to return it to it's hiding spot under the gnome before returning back to London. But for now he considered it his. His responsibility to ensure that his family home remains as secure as possible. He directs Sherlock back to the center of town, replacing his shoes and socks as they drive, then has him pull into a restaurant. He takes the briefcase in with him, somehow unwilling to part with the papers. They get a table in the back and John orders a beer, then places the briefcase on the chair beside him and pops it open. Pulling out the list of questions John begins digging through the other papers. His beer arrives before his food, and before he knows it it's gone and being replaced by another. Sherlock watches the people in the restaurant, dishing out glares and cold stares to those who do the same to them. He decides not to drink, not feeling comfortable enough to let his guard down. He looks at John, watching him go through the papers. He can't put his finger on it but something about this whole thing doesn't feel right.

""Listen to this,"" John says, pointing to a bit of underlined text.


""We learned early on that biting increases fertility if contraceptives are not being used (a fact other couples in our situation all agree upon) and re administering the bond bite during sex does the Omega (Joann) no harm. In fact, it always seems like my teeth find the same spot, over and over again.""


""So, he's saying you biting me, like you did earlier, didn't tear new flesh. Just... kind of... sunk home?"" John looks up at his mate, then takes a swig of his beer, passing the paper over to Sherlock who only half squinted at it.

""Relax, love. The worst that's going to happen is you'll get yelled at for letting me talk so much.""

""Arseholes."" Sherlock mumbles.

He reads the papers and something occurs to him. ""Gland expression?"" He looks at John. ""Biting the same spot of the bond can release hormones from the scent gland in the neck.""

Lifting a hand to the right side of his neck, John fingers his bond mark, then lets out a low whistle.

""Interesting. If that's the case, why didn't I learn about this in medical school?""

""What other properties does it have? Healing? Both physical and emotional? ""The medical field ignores omega's outside of their breeding capabilities."" 

""I suppose it could,"" Sherlock says with a  sigh. We can have a full blood panel worked up on both of us when we get back and compare it before we bonded."" He hums. ""In a letter.. hold on."" He looks through the papers.

""There's a letter your mum wrote. Talking about how she had this really bad flu. And your dad bit her instinctually. Without sex. And she was better within a day."" He hands John the letter.

""So... it's like this magical power that breaks the rules of the universe."" John says, shaking his head and swallowing the last of his second beer.

""People are dying, right now... mates... if only they knew. If only they'd bonded correctly.""

Sherlock frowns and nods. ""I don't know if there's a way to find a mate that doesn't happen by accident.""

""Yeah..."" John sighs, then is forced to move some of the papers when their food is brought out. He orders one more beer, then tucks in.

They continue to read over dinner, John's words becoming more slurred as he progresses through his third beer. They're just being asked if they wanted dessert when a loud explosion from the carpark makes John and Sherlock whip their heads up in surprise. Sherlock pulls out his wallet while John gathers the papers and stuffs them back into the briefcase. Handing over enough money to cover the cheque, Sherlock is up first and is already walking towards the exit when car alarms start to go off. John catches up, stumbling a bit, but keeping one hand firmly on the briefcase. Eyes wide with fear, he looks over at his mate as Sherlock pushes his way out of the emergency exit.

""Sherlock..."" He says softly, as they exit and see their rental car in flames. ""That's... our car.""

""We have to go. Now."" Sherlock grabs John's hand and takes off, needing to get them out of there as fast as possible. He gets them back to the inn and locks the door. He frowns, the room smelling freshly sanitized. ""What the fuck."" He starts to look around and their things have been gone through. He pulls out his phone and calls Mycroft. As soon as the call connects he starts talking.

""Someone just blew up our car. I've had a feeling we've been followed all day. Our room at the inn has been searched."" He growls.

""Wait, what?"" John mutters, looking around at the room. It takes him a lot longer to notice the subtle changes. The hard plastic travel case, which holds John's gun, has been moved from where John had handcuffed it to the bed frame. It was still secure, but John was certain he'd placed the case on it's side. Now it stood on end. He'd never gotten around to unpacking his suitcase, and being ex military, his packing skills were precise. Everything had it's natural place in John's case. Pants and socks in the top corner, then trousers. In the gaps, holding everything tight, would be t shirts. Then on top of those were his shirts he didn't want wrinkled. His pants had been pulled out and replaced below the trousers. After a quick count he growled.

""Pete... he took a pair of my bloody pants.""

Sherlock growls. ""I'll rip his throat out.""

""We need backup."" He growls at Mycroft, angry he's asking for help from Mycroft but he needed to keep his omega safe.

While Sherlock and his brother bicker (more like Sherlock bickering to a brick wall, John senses) John collects his gun and tucks it against the small of his back, covering it with his shirt. Out of habit, he goes to the window and peels back the curtain a smidgen and looks out. Nothing seems out of place, but the hairs on the back of his neck prickle.

""Someone's watching us. I can't see who, but I know they're out there. We nee..."" He stops short and walks to Sherlock, placing a hand over his mouth to silence him. ""Bugs?"" John mouths, looking around the room as if the very walls were listening in.

He pulls out the notebook he carries with him. Flipping to a blank page he writes


Car, text Mycroft... my house?""


Sherlock nods and hangs up the phone. He texts Mycroft to send a car immediately.

It takes less than five minutes for them to gather their belongings. John takes his case, thankful they'd packed light, and gives Sherlock the briefcase and his, motioning towards his gun, indicating he wanted a hand free. Sherlock nods once in understanding, then gives the room one last look, making sure they hadn't forgotten anything. John pulls Sherlock through the Inn, and out the back door. No one is in sight when they leave, but he still can't shake the feeling that someone is watching. Turning to make sure Sherlock is on his heels, he takes off at a sprint, heading away from the center of town towards an old abandoned building he'd once played in. Sherlock follows John close, keeping his eyes out for anyone or anything. The building is little more than bricks and timber now, but it offers some protection. Set back from the road, it also lets them watch for anyone coming. Sherlock pings Mycroft their location, then sits with his back against John's. Each of them watching the end of the road.

""So... Someone knows we're digging, and wants to kill us?"" John asks, keeping his voice low. ""Why?""

""I don't know.. either we know something they want to know or they don't want us to find something out. We need more data. And security.."" Sherlock frowns, holding the briefcase close.

""Bad timing and all.."" John says, getting up, ""But I need a piss.""

He doesn't go far, the building and the cover of dark provide enough shelter that he knows he doesn't risk a charge for public indecency. But he goes far enough that neither he or Sherlock will have to smell it while they wait.

Coming back, he settles into the same spot and rests his head against Sherlock.

""I fail to see how this is so dangerous,"" he complains, knowing that Sherlock was as confused as he was.

""We weren't followed up here. I would have noticed someone trailing us for five hours...""

""No. They were waiting. Waiting for us. Waiting for someone to come digging."" Sherlock frowns. ""Maybe your dad knew more than we think.""

""Think there is more in the house somewhere? If he had one hidden compartment, chances are good he'd have two or more."" John drags his hand through his hair and stiffens. ""Lights, coming my way. Car, it looks like, not torches.""

Sherlock stiffens and looks at the car. ""Mycroft said there'd be a signal.""

The car pulls up and the door opens, classical music pouring out.

Sherlock relaxes. ""It's our ride."" He nods and leads John out, the song being a piano and violin duet mummy used to make Sherlock and Mycroft play.

John doesn't relax once he's in the car. His gun presses against his back, reminding him of the danger lurking in the night. His hand instinctively finds Sherlock's and he squeezes their fingers together.

""I'm glad we have a habit of working over dinner... if those papers had been in the car."" he says, ""Not only would we lose information... but... it's my dads...""

""I know."" Sherlock kisses Johns knuckles. ""I'm sure Mycroft will have us under surveillance now just in case if anything. Well have him send us a scanner and we can copy all the papers.""

John nods, and settles back, letting Sherlock comfort him through their bond. When they get back to his house, John has the driver stop down the street. With the car idling, John looks over at Sherlock and purses his lips. He knows Sherlock won't like what he's about to propose, but it's their best option.

""Wait here. It will take me two minutes to walk to the house, another five to clear it. If you don't hear from me in eight minutes, you are to drive off and get back up. Keep my dad's research safe.""

Sherlock opens his mouth to argue but John silences him with a kiss.

""All three of us going together won't end well. I know how to clear a building, you don't. You being here, with the means to escape is the best option.""

Sherlock frowns. ""Take the agent.""

""No,"" John says firmly, kissing Sherlock once more. ""No.""

Before Sherlock has time to complain John's stepping out of the car and gripping his gun. Flicking the safety off, he took off at a brisk walk towards his childhood house. Glad that the key had been in his pocket, and not in the rental car, he slipped in quietly through the back and went over the house room by room. When he reached Harry's old room, he pulled down the staircase to the attic and checked the crawl space above. The home empty, he leaned against the nearest wall and pulled his mobile out. Seven minutes had passed, so he sent a short text.



All clear



Then went back to the living room to wait. Not liking the way the shadows made his home feel unsafe, he turned on all the lights downstairs while he waited. Sherlock goes in as soon as he gets the text. ""I should be angry at you for putting yourself in danger like that but it's also hot so.. it balances out.""

""I know,"" John says, letting his Alpha pull him into a strong embrace. ""I am a bit sexy when I go all James Bond, aren't I?""

Sherlock hums and nods, holding John close. ""It is. It turns me on when you're all cool and suave and in charge."" He mumbles and kisses John deeply. 

Mycroft's underling clears his throat in the doorway, but John just waves him off. His fight-or-flight no longer in high gear, and the adrenaline wearing off, he feels shaky and a bit sick to his stomach. But Sherlock's scent, and his hands along his back, sooth his tense body, and soon he's just left with his gut rolling.

""We can sleep in my parents bed tonight, I guess..."" John says, wrinkling his nose. ""Though, I don't need you deducing anything about how they slept."" His stomach clenches and he groans, flopping down on the sofa. ""If I had known we'd be running for our lives I wouldn't have had three beers.""

""I'll flip the mattress and make the bed."" Sherlock goes to get John a glass of water before making the bed.

John tries to drink the water, but just one sip of it makes his stomach threaten to upheave. When Sherlock comes back downstairs, he's curled up on his side with his mother's blanket draped over him.

""John?"" Sherlock frowns and kneels next to him, pressing his hand to John's forehead.

""Fine."" John says softly then forces himself to sit up. ""Just tired from the drive. Then ate too much, and probably drank too much."" Forcing a smile on his face he turns to the third man in the room. ""What are the chances of getting more backup, so Sherlock and I can sleep? Maybe some food delivered, and toiletries?""

The man simply nods, then steps away while lifting his phone to his ear.

""Something tells me someone should be awake at all times,"" John explains, pulling Sherlock with him towards the stairs, ""But we've been on our feet all bloody day, and neither of us are in the right frame of mind to stay up and stare at shadows.""

""I'm sure Mycroft is sending more. The agent arrived too soon to be from the city. He was here already."" Sherlock helps John up and takes him up to bed, keeping John's mother's blanket around him.

Wanting a shower, but remembering from his walkthrough that the bathroom had been empty of everything save for a single roll of toilet paper, John lets Sherlock bundle him into bed.

""Used to sleep in here, during storms."" John said softly, as he kicked his trousers off and shoved them over the edge of the bed with his feet. ""Seems silly now, to be afraid of thunder.""

""It's loud and jarring and the wind makes noises outside. It's perfectly logical."" Sherlock helps John into bed. ""Let me get a bowl or something in case you feel sick.""

John tries to shrug Sherlock off, but the effort makes his head spin. Thankfully faint scents of his parents lull him into a half asleep state. He stirs when Sherlock enters the room, and shuts the door behind him.

""Should we be worried about your brother snatching up the papers while we sleep?""

""I have them here,"" Sherlock says and puts the briefcase under the mattress. ""They won't be able to get it without waking us.""

Oh hey! An explosion!? Interesting....


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

On the morning of the third day spent back in his childhood home, John wakes up hoping to find his stomach settled. Instead, he rolls out of bed and rushes to the bathroom, doing his best to get sick as quietly as possible, not wanting to face Sherlock's concerned eyes.

He hadn't been much help over the last few days while Sherlock searched the house. He'd mostly been on the sofa, nibbling biscuits and watered down tea.

Washing his face, he sits on the edge of the tub while scrubbing a toothbrush over his teeth to rid himself of the taste of bile. As far as bugs went, it was mild, but he was glad that Sherlock hadn't caught it yet.

""John? Are you alright?"" Sherlock knocks gently at the door. He didn't like this. Not one bit. ""Maybe you should see a doctor? You've barely been able to keep anything down for days now. That's not like you. I've never seen you vomit before this week."" He raises the urge to pace. His mate is sick and he doesn't know why.

""Just a bug, love."" John says after spitting into the sink and washing the toothpaste down the drain. ""Probably got it from one of the kids at my aunts.""

He opens the door and smiles weakly at his mate. ""Plus, I am a doctor. Technically I just saw one, when I looked in the mirror.""

Sherlock frowns and nuzzles John since John had banned kisses so Sherlock doesn't catch anything even though Sherlock argued that doesn't make sense.

""I don't like seeing you like this."" He mumbles. He had found several more stashes of papers and even some interviews with other couples, anonymous.

""Close your eyes then?"" John jokes as he pulls from Sherlock's embrace.

""Think I'll try some toast today, if you're willing to make me some."" He says, heading downstairs while his stomach wasn't rolling. ""Hopefully today I can start scanning these pages into a computer.""

Over the past two days, John had managed to create a sort of system. He'd taken multi coloured folders and had sorted the pages into three stacks.

One containing letters written by his parents. Another for the questions his dad wrote down, and their answers, which were easily spotted by the number circled in the top corner. The third folder contained anything else they'd found. Newspaper clippings, copies of bonding certificates and reports, and letters written by other people to his parents.

He'd been too busy sorting to stop and read much, but having a system created would make life easier for both of them.

""Ha Ha."" Sherlock mocks a laugh at John's joke and follows him downstairs. He goes to make John some toast and gets him some electrolyte drink that helps vomiting.

It takes him twenty minutes, but John manages to eat the toast, and most of his drink while sitting up on the sofa. Reaching for a new stack of papers he glances through the topmost pages, then stops short.

""Sherlock!"" He calls. When Sherlock enters the room looking scared, John rolls his eyes. ""I'm fine, but look at this.""

He holds the picture up and shows him the photocopy of his parent's bonding records. It includes photos and all the documents John had just had to sign. But among the photos was a picture of his dad, for once smiling straight at the camera, with a fresh bite on his neck.

""Dad did it too... had them record it.""

""Oh wow.."" Sherlock subconsciously reaches up and rubs his neck as he looks at the picture.

""Not sure if it helps us though,"" John says, scrubbing a hand over his face. ""Truthfully, I don't even know what we're looking for.""

""At first I think we were looking for proof and we found that."" Sherlock nods to the papers. ""Now we have to figure out what to do with it..""

""Finding proof got our car blown up."" Sighing John slumps back against the sofa and pushes the rest of his drink away from where the scent won't bother him as much. ""Something tells me if we keep digging worse will happen... Is Mrs. Hudson safe?""

Sherlock nods. ""Mycroft is watching her. I had her go to her sister's."" He sits with John.

""Are there any more, you think? In the house?"" He asks, looking around imagining papers lining the walls.

""He spent a lot of time in his shed out back... we should check there as well."" John looks over at Sherlock and notes how his brows are furrowed. With a grunt, he kicks Sherlock's shins.

""Would you stop looking at me like I'm dying? Look, I've kept the toast down.""

""I know. I.. You smell off.."" Sherlock frowns, trying to figure out if a sickness can make someone smell different.

""Smell off?"" John says while narrowing his eyes. ""I shouldn't smell different because of a bug. I don't think.""

John lifts his wrist to his nose and inhales, wondering what it is that Sherlock's smelling. All he smells is skin, and home, and something soft.

""What's it smell like?""

""I don't know. It's subtle. Mild. Maybe it's because you're home?"" Sherlock frowns and leans in, sniffing John.

""Probably."" John agrees. ""I haven't been home since... well, mum. So it makes sort of sense. It's probably an emotional response.""

John's stomach begins to complain again, so he distracts Sherlock by giving him a push. ""Go check out the shed. Should be a key by the door before you exit the kitchen.""

Sherlock sighs and nods. ""Fine. If you need me or find something call me."" He finally gets up and heads to the back door.

As soon as Sherlock is out the door, John is up and heading for the nearest bathroom. Not for the first time in his life, he hugs the cold porcelain as he upends the contents of his meager breakfast.

Annoyed, but feeling slightly better not having anything in his stomach, he heads back to the living room and begins sorting through the papers once more.

Sherlock is outside for an hour. When he finally comes back in he's carrying a dirty rusted waterproof safe box.

John takes one look at the box and feels a wave of emotion roll over him. He'd seen his dad with that box countless times. While he and Harry had been playing in the back garden, their dad would sit inside his shed, hunched over something with that very box between his feet.

John had always assumed it held tools, but now looking at it he realized he'd been watching his dad try to solve the very problem they were now having.

It gave him an idea. Ignoring Sherlock's questioning gaze John goes upstairs and into his old room. It takes him a few minutes to go through the boxes but eventually he finds it. The book his mother used to read to him. The one that told the tale of Alphas and Omegas living in harmony.

He hurries back downstairs and goes into the kitchen, finding a knife. Then he does the one thing his book-loving heart swore to never do. Taking care not to damage anything, John slices the book blot from the case. He's barely got it off when something flutters to the ground.

Placing the knife down he bends down and picks up a yellowed sheet of paper. Turning to Sherlock, who was now watching him with curiosity, he says.

""Mum always said there was more to this story than the eye could see. I always thought she meant the pictures.""

""They certainly left a trail for you,"" Sherlock says softly.


 My sweet John, 



 Your father and I have devoted our lives to giving you and your sister the best lives we can. But I'm afraid we've stumbled upon something that might shatter our happy nest. We've taken every precaution we could, but still, it wasn't enough. 



 We've been looking into our bond, and finding people like us. Along the way, we've stirred up the hornet's nest. A group of men, unnamed as far as we can tell, approached us while we were on holiday and warned us to stop digging. 



 Your father is... was... a curious man. He refused to their faces, telling them we had every right to know more about our bonds than the government told us. I'm afraid it was foolish, though I applaud his bravery. 



 Last night I watched my Mate. My soulmate suffered what the doctors say was a natural heart attack. Only, I could feel that it wasn't his body betraying him, but something forging. The doctors wouldn't listen when I begged them to check him for poisoning... 



 My dear boy, your dad and I share a unique bond. A bond so rare that we thought we were alone in the world with our discovery. Over the years, the bond grew so strong that I could sense him his body, his mind, even his location. I just knew, even though I didn't know how I knew. 



 Last night I felt that presence vanish. Something I hope you'll never have to feel. I had hoped for more time. To be there when you're grown and to tell you about this bond. But I feel my life is destined for the same fate as Hank's. All we can do is leave clues behind, nudge you in the right direction, and hope you're wise enough to find the answers we could not. 



 If anyone can, it is you, my love. You've always been the smart one, no offense to your sister, but she thinks with her Alpha brain. Find the answers, John. Learn what your father could not. But be safe, protect yourself and your family, if you have one. I love you, and so did your father. 



 -Mum 


John reads the letter, noting the places where her tears had smudged the ink. He feels behind him for a chair and sinks heavily into it. The weight of his mother's words drags his heart into his stomach.

He looks up at Sherlock with tears in his eyes and passes over the letter.

""Oh, John."" Sherlock kneels at John's feet as he reads.

""Yeah..."" Is all John manages to say before he can't see or think through the tears.

Sherlock's arms engulf his body. For once John finds himself happy for his small frame. He wants to curl into a ball and exist only in Sherlock's embrace.

""Murder, then?"" John croaks.

""I think so.."" Sherlock says softly, holding John tight and scenting him.

""Fuck"" it's the only thing John can think go say. What else can you say when faced with a situation like this.

Sherlock holds John and rocks him slowly. He picks John up and carries him to bed.

John lets himself be Alpha-handled. Oddly enough it calms his stomach, letting Sherlock put him to bed like a small child. He clings to the bed first, then Sherlock when his mate slips between the blankets.

Wrapped up in his parent's bed he cries harder than he's cried since the day his mum died. He cries until there's nothing left in him, and all he can manage are full body shakes. Clinging to Sherlock's damp shirt he whispers, ""we need to be careful. I can't lose you.""

""I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you."" Sherlock holds John close and scents him. He didn't want to involve Mycroft any more than he was but Mycroft's people could keep them safer.

""Whatever you want to do we'll do. We can stop digging. Lay low."" He says softly, knowing John wouldn't let this go.

""Lay low, and let whoever murdered my father to remain free?"" John sits up and shakes his head. ""No. This is what we do. Solve crimes and put horrible people in jail.""

He wipes his eyes and clears his throat. ""This time it's personal. I just have to not get caught up in the emotion. We should visit my Uncle, my dad's brother. I wonder if he believes my Mum.""

""Well, he may have a clearer head about everything since he's a beta. Seeing things from an outsider perspective as it was."" Sherlock rubs John's back.

""If I don't eat or drink anything... I should be fine to go today."" John says then begins patting the blankets to find his mobile.

Sherlock finds it first and hands it over. Taking it John texts his Uncle and sets up a time to meet him later that day.

""He said he'll come here tonight after he gets off work.""

""You can't starve yourself."" Sherlock frowns, already planning out ways to drag John to the doctor's if he needs to.

""No, but I can hold off on eating directly before he gets here."" John sighs turning on the bed to face his mate. ""Face it. No one else is sick, not you, and unfortunately not any of your brother's underlings. I thought it was the beer, then I thought it was food poisoning. Now I just think it's stress.""

He knows Sherlock isn't completely convinced so he continues.

""We're recently bonded, my body is still trying to figure out how to be an Omega who isn't on suppressants or contraceptives. Then I come back here,"" he gestures to the room and the house. ""my system is going haywire. It's probably why I didn't get pregnant during my last heat.""

Sherlock frowns and cuddles John close. He does make a compelling argument. ""I just.. for some reason I'm not convinced. My instincts itch."" He nuzzles John.

""Now if I were pregnant this would all make sense. The extra sensitivity,"" John looks at the spot on Sherlock's shirt that is still damp from his tears, ""and then this could all just be chalked up to be morning sickness.""

He gets up off the bed and grimaces as the few remaining contents in his stomach slosh.

""Instead it's just another way my body is biting me in the arse for suppressing the natural order for so long.""

Sherlock sits up and watches John. ""If you throw up one more time I'm taking you to the hospital whether I have to carry you or drag you.""

""Remember who owns the gun in this relationship, Sherlock,"" John warns gently. ""I'm in no mood to have doctors shove their equipment up my arse just because I'm an Omega. I'm going back downstairs. We still have a lot of work to do.""

""This isn't about me trying to control you, John. This is about me trying to make sure you're alright. And if I have to protect you from yourself then I will. You'd the same and more for me. You have in the past. Just because we're working this case where everything is so omega and alpha focused don't forget that I never gave a toss about any of it and I still don't. You may not be in the mood to be poked and prodded but if you're sick I will not let you die from your own stubbornness."" Sherlock's face is hard and determined. ""So threatening me with your gun. You already know that I'd die to protect you so it's a moot point.""

John crosses his arms and turns to face Sherlock. He's ready to fight, but even as he opens his mouth to tell Sherlock where he can shove it something crosses over their bond. He can feel Sherlock's concern. It's palpable and deep, settling into John's mind like a weighted blanket. He reminds himself that Sherlock hasn't seen the battlefield, not like he has. He hasn't seen dying men or heard their moans. What Sherlock is seeing right now, is his mate suffering from something modern medicine can cure.

""Give me until tomorrow at least?"" He asks in a defeated tone. ""I already threw up breakfast while you were out in the shed, so it's safe to say lunch will go down just as well..."" He drags a hand through his hair and sighs he can feel Sherlock's concern deepen. ""If I can't keep down breakfast tomorrow, I'll go, you won't have to drag me.""

""Thank you,"" Sherlock says softly, upset John didn't tell him he grew up breakfast but relieved John agrees to go to the doctor if it continues.

""I love you,"" Sherlock says, he always says it after they have an argument or a small spat. He needs to make sure John hears it as well as feels it.

""Mmm,"" John says, nodding and walking to Sherlock. He wraps his arms around Sherlock's waist and sighs. ""I love you too, you git.""

He stays in Sherlock's arms for a long while. Sherlock's scent helps calm his stomach and nerves. Soon his breathing has returned to normal and the last traces of his tears are gone. Looking up into the face he'd grown so used to seeing by his side he smiles and nods his head towards the door. ""Bring me down a box of books, I'll go through them for any loose papers and I'll try to keep down some biscuits.""

""Okay."" Sherlock smiles and kisses John's forehead before doing as John says.

The morning ticks by minute by long minute. Around lunchtime Sherlock brings John another bottle of electrolyte-infused water, and a packet of hobnobs. An hour goes by before John realizes that he's eaten half the packet of biscuits, and consumed two drinks, without throwing up. Pleased, but not wanting to make a big deal out of it, he simply returns to the stack of papers and books.

Not wanting to tear open every book his family had ever owned, John instead ran his fingers along the covers and inspected the corners for lifting glue. Once he thought he'd found something, only to cut the book open and find it was just old and worn. He was just beginning to grow frustrated when Sherlock looked up from the stack of books he'd been pouring over and held up one of his mother's gardening books, his eyes bright with discovery.

""What? What did you find?"" John asked quickly.

""It's not a book, John. It's a journal. Your mother's journal."" Sherlock grins. ""Your dad's notes are all on loose papers. Your mum kept things more organized. Hidden in plain sight."" He passes the book to John. He notices how John is keeping down his snacks and drink but doesn't say anything in case it somehow jinxed John's progress.

John reaches for it eagerly and flips through the pages. He smiles, seeing more of his mother's flowery handwriting in neat straight lines.

""Got my handwriting from my dad, and note-taking skills from her,"" John says fondly while skimming over the first few pages. The first entries talk about life as a young teenager, what it was like to expect her first heat, knowing that after it was over she'd be eligible to be paired with an Alpha. As he reads her write about knowing her life would soon be over, that she'd be sold off to whichever Alpha was willing to pay for her, his stomach turned. But this time it wasn't the queasy feeling that came from eating bad food. This was anger manifesting into something tangible.

His mother describes meeting the man who'd placed a bid on her. The panic she felt at meeting a man twice her age. He traces his fingers over her words and feels his heartbreak for her. He had known that life hadn't been sunshine and rainbows for her, but hearing her describe it in such vivid detail made him angry.

""How could anyone do that to their child..."" he seethes to the pages, then reads on. What he reads next makes his heart stop. With a tremor in his voice, he calls Sherlock's name to get his attention. ""Sherlock, listen...""


Hank and I were in love. From the moment we met on the first day of Year 9, we knew. He was two weeks older than me, a point he teased me about endlessly. We had plans to marry and start a family, but when my parents introduced me to my intended Alpha our fantasy came crashing down.



I was barely sixteen and late presenting. All the other Omegas in our class had already experienced their first heat. But I wasn't worried, it gave Hank and I that much more time together.



My parents indulged our dating, if only because they knew it would be over soon. So when Hank showed up one night, dressed to the nines with a bouquet of flowers, asking if I'd like to see a film with him, no one objected. We did see that film, though we were too busy snogging to watch most of it. Then after, we ended up at his place and found his parents out. As teenagers might... we had each other that night. He looked at me, looming over me in the darkness of his room and asked me four words I'd been longing to hear. Can I bite you?



We didn't think it would create a bond, as I hadn't had my first heat yet. We just wanted to know what it felt like. He bit me, and I bit back. By the time we were spent, we knew it had been for real. I could feel him inside my soul, and he said the same. We cuddled until we heard his parents come home, then Hank snuck me out the back. My family was asleep, so I had no trouble getting to my room without being spotted.



I was fortunate enough to have a stomach bug for the next week, giving me time to find a way to hide my bond bite. If my parents saw, surely they would have forced me to have it removed. He was concerned over my illness, calling the house to check in on me. But when I returned to school, using a scarf to cover my neck, his eyes widened and I swear I've never seen that man look so panicked in my life. He pulled me into an empty classroom and shoved his nose against my stomach. A test from the chemist later that afternoon proved what his instincts already knew. I was pregnant.


We devised a plan, a fake heat where we'd claim to bond. The heat and bonding resulting in my pregnancy. Knowing that there was still a chance that my intended Alpha would take me, and Hank's child. But it was our best option. And thankfully for us, it worked.""

Sherlock listens intently and frowns. ""She didn't have a heat? She got pregnant without.."" Suddenly it dawns on Sherlock and he pushes John back against the couch. He ignores John's protests as he pulls John's jumper up and presses his nose to his belly, sniffing.

Pup his instincts supply as soon as he smells the soft delicate scent. He looks up at John, wide-eyed and frozen. For the first time in his whole life, his mind is still and silent beyond one work. Pup

John's still mumbling about being manhandled when Sherlock's eyes meet his. He looks like a rabbit in the headlights, wide-eyed and unsure which way to jump. He starts to push Sherlock away when his much slower mind catches up. He looks from the letter to Sherlock, then down to his stomach. He can hear the low buzz of conversation from two of Mycroft's agents in the other room, but he pushes them out of his mind.

""Oh... you mean? I'm..."" He places a hand on his stomach, just above Sherlock's head. There's nothing to feel, of course, but somehow focusing on the area feels right. ""We're... going to be parents?""

Sherlock nods slowly as his brain comes back online, processing everything. ""Pup."" He said since it's the only word rattling around in his skull.

""We should do a test, to be sure,"" John says though the thought is laughable. If this was the result of their coupling from the other night, surely it would be too soon for any over-the-counter test. ""But how? And why'd I get sick the next day? Morning sickness usually comes later.""

Sherlock doesn't seem willing, or able, to move so he lays back against the sofa and lets his mate scent his stomach. It's strange and ticklish, but it calms his upset stomach. When Sherlock sticks his tongue out and begins licking, John puts a hand in Sherlock's hair and laughs. ""Scenting is one thing, but licking me like I'm a damned ice lolly is another.""

""Pup. Our pup. Inside you."" Sherlock mumbles as he rubs his face against John's stomach. His brain was seemingly very slow to come back online and his instincts guiding him.

""Guess you get to drag me to the doctors after all."" John groans, but he's smiling. Carding his fingers through Sherlock's hair he silently thanks his mother for documenting everything.

Sherlock kisses and nuzzles John's belly. ""Mm, it all makes sense. Why omega's can only get pregnant during a heat. That's because it's not with their soulmate. That's why conception rates are so low. They're only fertile a handful of times a year. Soulmates can have pups whenever without a heat."" He mumbles, his brain working things out.

""Everything. Everything points to soulmates being the correct way. Selling omega's means controlling the supply of births. Less omega's mean higher prices which keep the rich and elite in power because they're the ones producing omega's. They don't care about betas having children unless by a miracle it turns out to be an omega. This is the way it's supposed to be. Finding your soulmate. Being connected. Content."" He rambles, brain making connections.

Sherlock remembers the day John came into the lab at Bart's. How each of his hairs stood on end and his alpha howled. It didn't make sense to him, how his instincts were so drawn to this beta when he never cared to be close to anyone before. How he thought of any reason to keep John in his life. Give him excitement, purpose, heal his leg, somewhere to live, companionship.

""I knew.."" He says after being silent for some time. ""I knew when you came into Bart's. I couldn't think. It was so distracting. I had to get out. And then you moved in and stayed. It only got more intense. Lestrade, I told him. I told him what I was thinking and feeling because I didn't know what it meant. I'd never felt like that before or thought that way before. He gave me a look like he pitied me but he was happy at the same time?"" He says, still confused.

""He said I was in love with you and I told him that was ridiculous. I didn't have feelings like that for anyone. Never had and how I doubted it would be for a beta who was careful to keep his distance from me except when we had to pretend to be a couple."" He's still rambling but he can't help it, all of this had been in his head for so long and now it made sense.

He presses his nose to John's belly again, trying to smell more. It smells like him and John and something new. Sweet. Fragile.

""No more. No more selling omega's to the highest bidder. No more unfulfilled soulmates. We'll figure it out. There has to be a way to figure it out. Blood samples or pheromones or something. There has to be something tangible. Something we can quantify and connect. To bring mates together. They deserve this. This feeling. This connection. Where secondary sex doesn't dictate what box they have to live in the rest of their life but a freedom to be who they are and do what they want."" Sherlock rubs John's tighs, still kneeling between his legs.

He needs data, proof. Samples from soulmates and similarities so they can find a way to track and match soulmates together. He can't imagine going through life the way he had before. He didn't know how empty it was. How alone he felt. How he was just drifting and doing what he thought was what he wanted.

""Our pups will not grow up like this. I won't have it. They won't be oppressed and made to conform for the likes of dullard uneducated masses. Whoever blew up our car knows. They know all this and more. We have to figure out who that is."" He growls softly.

John listens to his Alpha, petting his head in a soothing manner. Sherlock's voice softens the edges of his panic and shock. He thinks back to their first meeting and smiles. Remembering the brash man, with the shirt collar undone.

""When I saw you, I thought I'd either like to fuck him or tell him to fuck off. You were a pretty boy, after my life in the military. It was like seeing colour again, after seeing nothing but camouflage and sand for years. It scared me how I didn't want to stop looking at you. I didn't want to be seen as the mooning Omega, drooling at the closest Alpha.""

The rest of Sherlock's words sink in and he nods grimly. The most important case they could ever imagine had just been dropped on their laps, and all they had to go by was his parent's notes, and whispers in the wind.

Sherlock nuzzles and sniffs John's belly for a bit longer. ""You do realize I knocked you up on your childhood bed in your parent's house."" He snorts against John's belly.

""For fucks sake..."" John groans and finally manages to push Sherlock's head off of him. They catch each other's eyes and the unbridled mirth in Sherlock's gaze makes John burst out laughing. He laughs until his sides hurt then rolls his eyes so hard they risk rolling back into his skull. ""Better than my parent's bed,"" he laughs out.

Their noise brings one of the agents in, investigating what the ruckus was about. When neither John nor Sherlock is forthcoming, he shrugs and walks away. Clearly not finding manic laughter a security risk.

Sherlock grins and licks his lips. ""My mate. Pregnant with my pup."" He all but purrs, his alpha side deeply pleased.

""Good news, I'm not dying,"" John says, wiping a tear from the corner of his eye and stamping down the last of his laughter. Rubbing his stomach he smiles fondly at his Mate then tugs his jumper back down. ""Can't believe my mum got pregnant without even having her first heat. And they faked it! You heard Aunt Jennie, she said they were gone for days, she came back bonded and pregnant. It was a bloody coverup!""

""Quite ingenious on their part."" Sherlock chuckles, resisting the urge to push John's jumper back up and plastering himself to his belly. ""I'll look through the rest of your mum's books and see if she left any more journals.""

""I can't imagine the fear... Bonding to the person you loved while knowing that your Alpha parent was in the midst of negotiating your sale. They're lucky he didn't push to finalize that sale..."" John sits back up and prepares to go back over the rest of the entry, but stops short. ""Do you think he had my dad killed?""

""I... I don't know. We have to find out who it was that was going to buy your mother."" Sherlock frowns.

""We can ask my Uncle tonight, if not, we can see if my aunt knows."" John grimaces at the thought of returning to her house, but the answers they need outweigh any of his personal discomforts.

Finding himself hungry, he wanders into the kitchen and makes himself toast, while the kettle boils.

""We're not going back to see her. Whatever she knows we can find out some other way."" Sherlock follows John, not letting more than a few feet of space between them.

John puts teabags into two mugs then frowns.

""Am I okay having caffeine? Christ, I can't remember...""

""It's fine. Just try and limit it to one cup a day."" Sherlock says, having read as much as he could on the do's and don'ts when they were trying to get pregnant before.

John lets out a relieved sigh, pours hot water into the cups, and pops the bread into the toaster. While waiting for the bread to brown he pulls Sherlock into his arms.

""Pup... or, pups?"" He says happily, ""explains why my stomach felt better any time you were close, and probably why those damn hobnobs didn't bother me. They're going to be junk food eaters like you are.""

Sherlock chuckles softly and nuzzles John. ""Makes sense. You are carrying a pup and or pups so it would be easier for you to handle things I like. Comforting at least."" He kisses John tenderly. ""I don't know how many. It's probably far too soon to make a distinction. I wonder if it will smell different? If you're carrying multiples.""

""Mmm. I wonder."" John says, then jumps when the toaster pops. He ignores Sherlock's laughter, quite used to the teasing by now. He couldn't help it if a toaster, of all things, made him jump. Even if he could perform a life saving surgery with explosives going off around him.

Slathering butter and honey on the toast he lets Sherlock fix their tea, then they take the food into the other room. He pours over the loose letters from his dad while he eats, then when he's done he lays back and calls Sherlock over.

""Come scent me, let's see if it helps me keep the toast down.""

Sherlock doesn't have to be told twice and he immediately goes, scenting John liberally.

I'm terrible at naming chapters. I wanted name this ""Letters in the walls, and a bun in the oven"" but that just felt long. Plus, the letter wasn't in the wall, was it? - Tindo


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

The back door opens, but John doesn't look up. They would have heard shouting (or worse) if it were a stranger. He inhales deeply, loving the excitement lingering in Sherlock's scent. But instead of just smelling his mate he smells something lemony.

Groaning, John rolls his head back and sees the upside-down shape of Mycroft Holmes standing in the doorway to his childhood living room.

""Well, if it isn't Uncle Mycroft,"" John says before realizing what he'd said.

Mycroft raises a brow and looks them over. ""I wasn't expecting a happy announcement quite so soon."" He hummed, knowing John didn't conceive after his last heat.

""What are you doing here, Uncle Mikey?"" Sherlock snorts, knowing Mycroft hates nicknames.

Mycroft rolls his eyes. ""I have information.""

""What is it?"" John asked, placing a hand on the nape of Sherlock's neck, letting him know he didn't want Sherlock to move.

Mycroft sighs and moves across the room to sit in the single armchair. Leaning his umbrella against the side of his chair, he folds his hands over one knee and leans forward.

""Sherlock has, for once, been keeping me updated with your findings. I was able to unearth the name of the man who was supposed to buy your mother.""

John sits up, dislodging Sherlock. He looks across the room to the man. In a cold voice, he simply asks ""Who?""

""A man by the name of Jacobs Moriarty. He dabbles in sales"" Mycroft says with distaste, letting John know that whatever it is Jacobs sold was just a front. ""Wealthy man, untouchable. He saw the advert your grandparents posted when your mother approached legal age and was the highest bidder.""

""Let me guess, he was pissed that my dad knocked her up, but having someone else's pup in the picture wasn't in his plan?""

""Quite so,"" Mycroft says with a nod.

Sherlock stills, remembering the name Moriarty from the cabbie. ""Is he local? Or has local contacts?"" He asks, wondering if there's a connection to the car bomb.

""Oxford,"" Mycroft says with a shake of his head. ""Though his business takes him all over the country, and abroad. I wouldn't put it past him to have connections as vastly spread out as I do.""

Tugging his shirt back down once again, John sits up and folds one leg under him. He realizes a moment later that his mum used to sit like this, and the thought made him smile briefly.

""So, this arse put a bid in on a 16-year-old girl. To do what exactly? Get her after her first heat, or was he at least going to wait until she was 18?""

""Unsure, Doctor Watson... John,"" Mycroft amends, ""They were still in the early stages of negotiation when your parents bonded.""

""Oh... about that,"" John says, quickly explaining the circumstances of his parent's bonding. Mycroft raises an eyebrow, and says ""Remarkable people, having remarkable children.""

""Hold on, is that a compliment?"" John says, looking from Mycroft to Sherlock.

Sherlock raises a brow and looks Mycroft over. ""Oh. Why?"" He frowns. ""You talked to Harry. For what reason?""

""After the incident with your car, I felt it prudent of me to check in on John's sister. We are unsure of the target. It could be John, or it could be his parent's research. Regardless, Harry is still involved, if only remotely.""

Mycroft sits back and gives John a careful look. ""I've removed her to a secure location. One that has no access to alcohol. It should be... beneficial.""

""Right, thanks..."" John says, instantly feeling guilty that he hadn't thought of his sister.

""Meanwhile, we need to know more about the physical changes a perfect match causes in the body. John, what are the chances you have had bloodwork done recently?""

John was taken aback by Mycroft asking for his records rather than just taking them. He assumed it had something to do with Sherlock being his Alpha, and Mycroft attempting to go through the proper channels.

""I had a full workup done before I enlisted, and after they sent me home. Sherlock will have to sign off on you getting copies, but you have my permission.""

Sherlock nods. ""Get the paperwork and I'll sign it."" He hums. ""And you have my blood work from.."" He sighs. ""From rehab.""

""Already acquired,"" Mycroft says, reaching into his breast pocket for a medical release form.

He passes it to John, who checks it over then hands it to Sherlock with a nod.

""I assume we should get a full blood panel done now that we're bonded. Hopefully, the baby won't skew the results too much."" John says, placing a hand over his stomach.

""If anything I'd think it would amplify the effect."" Sherlock hums as he signs the papers, annoyed he's the one having to sign and not John.

""Do you need us to go somewhere specific?"" John asks, ""I can draw the blood myself if you get me the kit.""

""I'll have it sent first thing tomorrow.""

""What are we looking for?"" John asks quietly as Sherlock settles on the sofa beside him.

""We aren't sure yet,"" Mycroft says uneasily and John got the feeling that Mycroft disliked not knowing more than Sherlock.

Sherlock thinks. ""Betas."" He says suddenly.

""Betas?"" John and Mycroft both say, turning to look at the lanky detective who was currently in the process of leaning forward to rub his face on John's stomach.

""Oi..."" John says with a huff of laughter. ""Think, love. The pup can wait two minutes for his dad to be brilliant.""

""Beta's before they have children they have health checks to make sure they have compatible blood types and such. So that the pup doesn't get anything passed down to them or the mother has ill effects with a second pregnancy."" Sherlock mumbles, rubbing his face against John's belly again. He can't help it. It's like he's being pulled. ""We're looking for comparability so why not look at the cellular level? If we're not biologically compatible it wouldn't work.""

""Makes sense,"" Johns says with a smile, his hand finding its way back to Sherlock's hair.

""Gives us something to start with, at least.""

""Whether or not the outcome is to have children is a moot point. We should also look at pheromones and scents. John likes my scent but Mycroft's is a turn-off. Why? We're related. It has to do with a biological component."" Sherlock mumbles, scenting John.

""Maybe, because your blood is similar enough that nature needed a way to guide me to you, not your brother?"" John says, honestly just guessing at this point. ""You're both Alphas, same parents... it wouldn't hurt to compare your blood as well, Mycroft.""

""I'll see to it,"" Mycroft says, watching his brother with soft eyes. ""While you look the part of a fool, Brother mine... you seem happy.""

""The happiest fool of all the seven seas."" Sherlock mumbles, nuzzling against John's belly. ""It's physically imperative I do this or else I can't think. Even less than I already am.""

""You should also look and see if there are samples of John's parents' DNA on file. We need a larger pool to sample from. We need to find others. Others with soulmate bonds. If we have any hope of figuring this out we need more data. We also need to look into folk and fairy tales. Especially those perpetuated by omegas. We need more omega input. They're the key. Omegas are the key."" He resists licking John's belly but only just. He's not sure if he's making any sense but that doesn't really matter to him since he can smell his pup.

""Is there a room I can use to make a few phone calls?"" Mycroft asks John, a bemused smile on his face.

""Yeah, my old room."" John directs him up the stairs then turns to his mate. ""This is going to be a problem, isn't it? We're going to be doing the bloody grocery shopping and all of a sudden my shirt's going to be lifted and your head pressed against my stomach. Still... I kept food down finally.""

""Mm, it'll get better. Maybe."" Sherlock mumbles and then laughs. ""Mycroft is going to be able to smell the sex we had on the bed.""

""Why do you think I sent him there, and not Harry's room?"" John laughs.

""So... Moriarty?"" He asks cautiously, knowing that word was a sore spot for Sherlock. It reminded him there were things even his vast intellect didn't know about.

Sherlock hums and nods. ""It keeps coming up. Now we know it's a real person. And real people can be dealt with.""

John closes his eyes and allows himself a moment to enjoy Sherlock's closeness and the newfound knowledge that he was carrying their pup. Less than three days old, it was already the most loved child John knew.

He listened to the sound of footsteps above. Mycroft pacing, just like Sherlock did when he was annoyed.

""I want to go back to the ocean,"" John says softly, looking down at Sherlock.

""Whenever anything happened, good or bad. I'd ride my bike there. This,"" he says, placing a hand on his stomach, ""is good, and I need to go.""

""Alright. I'll make us a thermos of tea and tell Mycroft. You'll need a thicker jumper. It's windy out."" Sherlock kisses John and slowly starts to peel himself away.

""I'm pregnant, Sherlock... not an old man who wears jumpers in the summer,"" John says, then looks down and grimaces. He is, in fact, wearing a jumper, and it's damn near summer out.

Sherlock opens his mouth in rebuttal but John points a finger at him and shakes his head once. ""No, nope. Not a word.""

""Mm fine."" Sherlock hums and finally gets up, deciding to pick his battles. He goes to tell Mycroft that they're going to the beach and Mycroft tells him to take agents. Sherlock rolls his eyes and goes down to make tea.

John picks up his mother's journal and tucks it under his arm, then retrieves his jacket. He takes it with him, while pointedly not putting it on. John had made it a point to go out of his way to disobey or ignore orders from an Alpha, and he wasn't going to start listening now just because Sherlock was outing himself as a nervous father.

They take one of the agents with them, John letting the man drive. (As driving with your Mate's head or hands constantly on your stomach would be unsafe.) He directs the man to a spot nearby, where they can be observed from a distance, allowing the agent to keep the car secure.

John picks his way across the rocks and finds one big enough to sit on. There's no sand here, but the rocks are smooth and worn from years in the sea.

""This was my spot,"" he said, staring out over the lapping water. ""I'd come here when I just needed to escape. Did you have a spot like that?""

Sherlock nods. ""The woods surrounding my grandmother's house. After Mycroft went to university I spent a lot of time with her there before I was sent to boarding school.""

""Nature..."" John nods. ""Calming, peaceful, yet alive.""

They sit for a while, the ocean waves calming John until the tension from the last few days subsided. Any time his stomach lurched, he'd pull Sherlock close and the pains would go away.

""Why do you think it's like this? The strange morning sickness? Is it because I'm supposed to be near you right now? A form of bonding, between the parents and the fetus? It isn't like this normally. An Omega's pregnancy is almost a spitting image of a Beta's. The same time frame of symptoms, gestation period... everything. The only thing that changes is fertility rate, it being higher in Omegas allowing for multiples more frequently.""

""I'm not sure. Our bond is still new as well. And I don't mean this as a derogatory thing but you are older than the average omega when they have their first pup. Maybe your body just needs to be sure I'm here. That we're in this together."" Sherlock holds John close, scenting him.

""Mmm, by now most omegas are having their last litter. And we're just getting started.""

John leans into Sherlock's warmth, enjoying being cared for.

He sits and reads his mother's journal a bit, but stops when he finds the entry describing Harry's birth. Saving it for when they were back at the house.

""We should think about heading back soon, and dinner. I don't think being out in the open like this is exactly smart, but I wanted to get some fresh air.""

""I'm sure Mycroft has this whole town crawling with agents. I've spotted at least four just sitting here."" Sherlock hums, there seems to be even more while they've been out. Maybe Uncle Mycroft had a soft spot for pups.

""We can go back whenever you like. And a light dinner. Don't want to overwhelm your stomach when you just started to calm down."" He sniffs John, seeing if there's any change. ""Oh, he couldn't smell it."" He says, realizing Mycroft couldn't smell John being pregnant.

""Alright,"" John says, settling back again and staring out over the water. They sit for ten more minutes until John is forced to admit (to himself) that Sherlock was right and the wind did have a bite to it.

Standing up he helps Sherlock to his feet then picks his way back over the rocks to the path leading back to the car. Once in the car he gets his mobile and places an order for two large pizzas for them to pick up. Hanging up he looks over to find Sherlock staring at him.

""I'm hungry,"" he says with a shrug. ""And I'm pregnant now so I can blame it on the pup.""

""Mm blame this on the pup too."" Sherlock hums and lifts John's jumper and sticks his head inside, face presses to John's belly. ""Mycroft couldn't smell it. It's faint but still, he would have picked up on it. He would have made a comment about your scent change. We're the only ones that can smell the pup. For now at least."" He kisses and licks John's belly.

""Make..."" John starts to say but begins laughing as Sherlock's tongue begins to tickle him. ""makes sense,"" he tries again ""when you bonded me, it locked my scent in for you only. They'll still be something that tells others I'm an Omega, but my unique scent is for you only now.""

John tries to fight Sherlock out of his shirt but it's no use. In the end, he's forced to accept that for now, Sherlock's face was a permanent fixture on his stomach.

Sherlock lets out a low happy growl at John's scent only being for him. Only he gets to smell John. He nuzzles and scents John's belly. He knows the pup would be microscopic at this point. Tiny tiny. So small. So fragile. He can't help but want to be close. To protect John.

Oh hello wrench, meet plot.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


When they arrived back at the house a man was standing next to his car talking to agents.



""That's him!"" John says excitedly, exiting the car the moment it stops. He leaves the pizzas on the seat for either Sherlock or Mycroft's minion to get and heads straight for the newcomer.



""Uncle!"" He cries happily, walking straight towards the man and wrapping his arms around his shoulders. They embrace quickly, then John turns to see Sherlock's holding the pizzas against his hip.



""Sherlock this is my dad's brother, Matt.""



John keeps his hand on his Uncle's arm. Though a beta the man's baseline scent is close to his father's and it reminds John of warm hugs and burying his face in his dad's chest. 
He looks at Sherlock and smiles, seeing his partner's eyes dart over his kin. Then his eyes crinkle and a small smile graces his lips as if John being happy made him happy.



Sherlock extends a hand, ""Sherlock Holmes,"" he says, introducing himself.



""Well, technically Holmes-Watson,"" John says, ""Still getting used to that. He's my Mate.""



Matt's eyes instinctively flick to John's neck then he nods once and shakes Sherlock's hand. 
John leads them into the kitchen, when Sherlock takes his coat off he hears his Uncle gasp and turns to see his uncle staring at Sherlock's neck.



""You..."" He says gently, looking from John to Sherlock, ""soulmates?""



""So you know."" Sherlock sets the pizza boxes on the table and gets some plates.



""How could I not? With my brother nose deep in it like he was."" he doesn't seem surprised when John and Sherlock nod.  Instead, he looks around the house and shrugs. ""I see why you came back, and why you called me. I'm sorry to say I don't know much. But,"" he looks over at John and gives him a warm smile, ""It is great to see you. Been following your blog. No one told me you went off and joined the army.""



""And got my doctorate."" John says, not unkindly, ""Mum made Harry promise.""



""Yeah, I remember that.""



John gestures to the table, then they all hear footsteps coming down the stairs, ""Apparently the queen could smell the food,"" he mutters to his mate who snorts before masking his mirth.



""Evening all. Nice to meet you, Mr. Watson. I'm Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother."" Mycroft introduces himself.



Sherlock opens the pizza boxes and gets John some slices on a plate, his instincts telling him to feed his mate first. 
John looks pointedly at Sherlock, then at the pizza. When Sherlock rolls his eyes (but grabs a slice for himself) John lets his face soften. He couldn't remember the last thing Sherlock had eaten, which meant it had been at least twenty-four hours since his last meal. While he appreciated Sherlock's focus, they'd already had to run for (presumably) their lives once. If they had to do so again, John wouldn't want to have to pick Sherlock up and carry him due to his mate passing out from low blood sugar.



Matt introduces himself to Mycroft, then looks out towards where his car sat in the driveway. Nodding his head, and accepting a plate from Sherlock, he asked, ""They coming in? Those two...""



""Agents,"" Mycroft says, filling in the blanks. ""They're currently on the clock. They'll eat when their shift is over.""



It takes them most of dinner to fill Matt in on everything that had happened since John had returned home. When they tell him about the incident with the car he lets out a low whistle and mentions he'd seen it on the news. John finishes by telling him about the research they'd found hidden away and shakes his head sadly.



""I never knew what they were looking into,"" John says, running a hand over his mothers journal.



""I did, to an extent. Used to watch you rugrats when they went off to chat with another couple. Remember all our movie nights?""



""You mean the nights you gave me cavities,"" John laughs gently. ""So they were off on research trips then?""



""Never could sit still those two. Even when things started getting dangerous. More than once the breaks on their car would fail, or warning notes would show up on their door. But they didn't stop... Even after Hank..."" Matt says, clearing his throat, ""Joann wouldn't give up. She knew there had to be something more to life, than forced bonds.""



""Do you remember any of the couples they talked to?"" Sherlock asks, eating under John's watchful eye.



Matt furrows his brow and scratches his index finger over his eyebrow. Sherlock notices the gesture and wonders if John's dad had exhibited the same tick, or if their children would pick up John's mannerisms.



""Not sure... There was a couple in Ulverston, name was something cook something..."" He shrugs, then drums the fingers of one hand on the table. ""Could chat with a couple my parents knew. Our parents were betas, but I remember both of their friends having bites. Things like that stick out to a kid who isn't used to seeing bond marks daily. They're in a care home not far from here.""



Matt gives John the name and address, then looks around at the half-empty house. ""It's a bit weird... seeing this place like this.""



""Yeah,"" John nods, ""I know.""



""I don't mean to be a damper but simply being here now involves Matthew. Whoever blew up the car will be watching him as well."" Mycroft hums as he finishes his slice of pizza.



John glares over at Mycroft but Matt just laughs it off.



""If you're worried you'll have to give up one of your government men to watch me, don't. Who do you think gave John the military bug? I can defend myself. And if anyone comes asking, I'll just tell them I wanted to visit my nephew and wish him well on his bonding. Still new?"" he asks, looking from John to Sherlock, then back to his nephew. ""You two keep going from moon eyes to glares.""



""New-ish."" John nods.



""New enough."" Sherlock agrees, picking up another slice of pizza when John gives him a look.



John finds himself tempted to tell his Uncle the other half of the news, but Mycroft's warning made him pause. He would tell his Uncle when it was safer. If word spread about his pregnancy it would make him a weaker target, and an easy way to gain access to Sherlock. They chatted for a while longer, both Watsons proving to Mycroft just how stubborn the Watson line was until Matt glanced at the clock and sighed.



""I should head home, the wife will be waiting. It was good to see you again, John. And wonderful to meet you, Sherlock."" He looks at Mycroft and purses his lips, then says, ""You're not half bad either. While it looks like you have a rose bush up your arse, you seem to genuinely care about these two.""



Mycroft makes a nose that is almost a stutter before masking his face and shaking Matt's hand. John walks him to the door, then gives him a final hug. ""Sorry I was a stranger. I'll do better.""



""Yeah well, it works both ways, I could have done better too,"" Matt says, then pats the pocket where his mobile is located. ""I'll stay in touch.""



John gets back to the table just in time to hear Mycroft mutter ""Watsons"" as he stands.



""Watsons indeed."" Sherlock chuckles softly.



""We're a stubborn lot,"" John says, walking up behind Sherlock and leaning over his sitting frame. He places his head on Sherlock's shoulder and nuzzles the side of his face. ""I warned him it might be dangerous before inviting him here. He'll be okay. He was a Royal Marine, can hold his own.""



Sherlock nuzzles John, eyes closing as he relaxes. ""Mycroft will just have to get used to it when he babysits."" He teases.



John snorts, imagining Mycroft reasoning with a toddler than was half Holmes and half Watson. ""There's no hope for him, is there?"" he asks with a laugh.



Having eaten his first full meal in days, his stomach is less than thrilled with him. But John has enough time to put the dishes in the sink before he needs Sherlock. ""Bedroom?"" he says softly, rubbing his stomach, ""bit of nuzzling while I read more of mum's journal?""



Sherlock nods and finishes putting the leftovers away before following John up. ""You're starting to look better. Not so pale.""



""Helps to have you scent me. I can keep food down."" John nods, closing the bedroom door. ""Whoever I'm growing in here is going to be a handful."" He sighs happily then sprawls out on his parent's bed, pulling Sherlock with him. ""Let's see what mum has to say about birthing soulmate pups, shall well?""



He reads the entry aloud, the doctor in him able to appreciate the attention to detail his mother gave the entry. When he's done, he closes his eyes and places the book on his chest, and watches Sherlock as his Alpha showers his stomach with kisses. ""So, dad bit her again, during both births. I wonder if it was instinctual, or if they'd planned it.. she doesn't say.""



""Did he help her give birth?"" Sherlock asks, nuzzling and kissing John's belly. He decides John's jumper is just in the way so he strips John's top half completely so he has unhindered access to John's belly.



""She sounds like a doctor, John. The way she wrote everything down, the monitoring, weighing, temperatures. Every day. It was her log. Her research documents. I.."" He scents John. ""When I was out in the garden shed I found medicinal plants. Things you'd find in an apothecary or holistic medicine."" He hums. ""Did you and Harry ever get sick as pups?""



""Mmm the occasional stomach bug here and there, and Harry brought home lice once,"" John says thinking back, letting his mate manhandle his clothing off of him. ""But that was it, mainly. Why you think she found a way to keep us healthy?"" he asks, turning back to the book and leafing through the pages. 
Sure enough, towards the back, the book went from a journal to a log. Hand-drawn sketches of plants with descriptions written below them of their uses. He lets out a low whistle then shakes his head. ""I barely knew them...""



""I think maybe she was worried to take you to a doctor. A doctor who works for the government."" Sherlock says softly, in some of John's mother's letters she seemed wary of people in official roles.



""We went to the local GP a few times,"" John muses, ""but mainly just for the shots, we needed for school. I always thought it was because they didn't approve of all the tests they ran on omega children.""



John reaches down and strokes a hand through Sherlock's hair. After a moment his fingers tighten and he pulls Sherlock up for a kiss. When Sherlock finally settled on his side on the other half of the bed John rolled over and faced him.



""So many secrets, and while we've learned so much, I feel like we haven't made any forward progress. What's next? Do we go visit the couple my uncle mentioned? Or do we start digging into Jacobs Moriarty?""



""We'll leave Moriarty to Mycroft for now. I doubt we'd be able to get anything on him ourselves at the moment. We'll see if he ever purchased another omega."" Sherlock cuddles John close.



""We could but we also have to be careful because we know we're being watched so anyone we come into contact with could also be in danger. Like I said before omegas are the key. We need to look for an omega group willing to part with information. If not to both of us to you at least."" He rubs his face to John's neck.



""So,"" John sighs, feeling a bit defeated and overwhelmed, ""We need to find a walk to talk to the omegas, without being seen talking with them. Meanwhile we're sitting here, where everyone can see us. I don't want to leave for a safe house, and that also doesn't feel like our best option. Not when there is leg work to be done. We need someone who isn't watching us, who can interview people for us. And, if we can swing it, I think a secure online forum where people can anonymously reach out might be nice. Someone out there knows something we don't....""



John sighs and rolls onto his other side, pressing his back against Sherlock's chest and pulling Sherlock's arm over his chest. It was still too early to tuck in for the night, but he needed this, needed the closeness. Plus, Sherlock seemed to do his best thinking while scenting him. ""We need an outside man or woman..."" he says softly.



Sherlock holds John close, kissing his neck and back as he scents him. ""Someone with access to omegas but isn't threatening. Someone who wouldn't raise suspicions. Who had access to channels.."" He mumbles as he thinks.



""Anyone, you know of in your brother's office?"" John thinks aloud, not wanting to get up and ask Mycroft himself. Not when Sherlock was busy nuzzling against him.



""Mm since Mycroft got shot he's always used Anthea for leg work."" Sherlock mumbles. ""Oh! Anthea! She's perfect! She's a beta and female! She can slip in and out no problem. She's Mycroft's right hand so she's trained to the teeth.""



""Wait,"" John says, turning halfway around to face Sherlock, ""He got shot?""



""Mmhmm. Few years ago. I was in rehab and I escaped after I got word he was shot. He had a total knee replacement and uses the umbrella as a cane. That's why he doesn't do leg work anymore. Anthea isn't his assistant. He's her handler."" Sherlock hums.



""Huh,"" John says settling back down against the mattress. ""Can't picture him doing fieldwork. But.. yeah Anthea would work. Should we go ask your brother?""



""Probably since he and Anthea have been sleeping together."" Sherlock hums.



John snorts. The thought of Mycroft in bed with anyone somehow feels like asking the Queen to vacuum. He sits up and reaches for his shirt and pulls it over his head, wishing he had packed a robe or more clothes.



""Do you think we should return to Baker Street soon? It can't be cheap for Mycroft to be here, or for him to have his agents watch us this far out. Heading home might also give whoever is watching us the false assumption that we've stopped digging.""



He doesn't want to leave. Despite his earlier fears that coming back to his childhood home would stir up too many memories, it had been pleasant to be here. Plus, there was the incident on his childhood bed to forever make the trip worth it. But still, the home was too vulnerable to attack, and away from London, they were away from the support of friends and police they trusted.



""Don't worry about the money. Protection is written into Mycroft's contract and it extends to family. We're going to be monitored regardless of danger or not. I know you don't want to leave this place. We can take whatever you want with us."" Sherlock says softly.



""London is our  home,"" John's says after a few minutes. ""These walls hold memories, but not ours. I want our bed, our flat, and sounds that are familiar. Once we're sure there's nothing else hidden here, let's head home."" He looks over at his mother's blanket and smiles, ""and yeah, I'll take a few things with us.""



""I'll talk to Mycroft and we'll make plans to go home."" Sherlock nods.



""Hey,"" John grabs Sherlock's arm as he starts to walk away and pulls him close, ""I love you.""



He nuzzles his Mate a minute longer than picks up his mother's journal. ""I'll be taking a bath and reading if you need me. I'd like a glass of wine but...I guess I'll have to come up with something else to drink for the next nine months.""



""I love you, too."" Sherlock nuzzles John and scents. ""Grape juice? Sparkling grape juice?"" He suggests.



""Mm, could work."" John rummages through his case for his pyjamas and heads off to the master bathroom while Sherlock talks with his brother.



Meanwhile, John skims through his mother's journal, smiling at the detail and effort she put into it. She must have worked on it after they'd gone to bed, he couldn't remember ever seeing her write. 
Sherlock knocks on John's old bedroom door, hearing Mycroft inside.



Mycroft gets up and goes to the door, his phone to his ear. ""Can I help you, baby brother?"" He muses.



Sherlock looks at him and rolls his eyes. ""We need Anthea. Tell her to be here in the morning. We need to discuss the next steps.



""Why do they need me, My?"" Anthea says to Mycroft over the phone. She was holding down the home office while Mycroft was making sure Sherlock was safe. Mycroft had trained her to succeed him one day and takes over when he needs her to. She rather likes being in charge, bossing all the alphas around. 
Sherlock quickly explains what he and John had just discussed and braces himself for pushback from his brother. Instead, he gets a single nod, then Mycroft is barking orders into the phone. 
Once done he hangs up and turns back to Sherlock.



""John is right, London is safer if he's refusing a safe house. We both have eyes and ears everywhere in the City. And, as he said, if we play our cards right we can delude people into thinking you've given up. If only for a short time.""



Sherlock nods. ""John's mother was meticulous. She kept exact notes in everything, Mycroft. Every feeling and inclination. Her instincts were spot on. She knew when John and Harry were going to get sick even before they started showing signs of an illness."" He sighs. They don't have enough data and it's driving him nuts.



""When Anthea comes in the morning have her bring a blood draw kit for John and me as well. We need to see the changes in both parties. I think we should start sniffing around the legitimacies of some of these so-called matchmaking services. If anything they're fronts for omega trafficking."" He says and rolls his eyes when he sees the look on Mycroft's face. ""Yes, I know this is how things are done but they're still trafficking people to the highest bidders. It's a human rights violation and I don't care if the law doesn't recognize omega's as their own people."" He growls.



""I have to get back to John before he starts feeling sick again. Enjoy your dirty phone calls with Anthea."" He turns to go back to John. He's so wrapped up in making sure John is alright it doesn't occur to him that it's not a good idea to have Anthea come to them if they were going to use her for undercover work. It's a good thing it occurs to Mycroft.



John hears the bathroom door open but doesn't lookup. He can tell by the way the air crackles that it's Sherlock and not Mycroft invading his space.



He hears a soft rustle and looks up, expecting to see Sherlock removing his clothing. Instead, he watched as Sherlock sits with his back against the tub. He rolls one sleeve up and slings an arm over the edge, his long hands resting on his leg.



""So much here... But the more I read the more I realized that Mum was more interested in the moment. She seems happy documenting our lives while all of dad's papers have a more frantic feel to them. Like he wanted answers, and wasn't content just riding the wave.""



""Well if you're anything like him, which I'm sure you are, his protection instincts would have been off the charts. He wanted to keep you and Harry and your mum safe."" Sherlock hums softly, his brain quieter now that he's back with John.



""Yeah..."" John says noncommittally. Placing the book on the edge of the tub he skinks down into the water until just his nose is sticking out. It's quieter in the water. He'd begin to get used to the constant hum of Sherlock in his mind but the last few days had been difficult for both of them.



And now, with the pup, his head felt like someone was trying to push his brain through his ears from the inside out. 
Lifting his head enough so his mouth and ears were briefly above water he says gently, hoping not to offended Sherlock,



""She found a way to quiet the constant chatter of the bond. It's not permanent. But they used it when they needed to focus, for work or something like that.""



Sherlock takes the book and sets it on the counter, knowing John would be upset if it fell into the bath. ""Tell me how to do it."" He says, knowing he must be driving John round the bed with his mind constantly on. 
John opened one eye and surveyed his Mate for a long moment.



""It's like my switch during my heat. You just... Focus on it, will it to shut off. Which makes me wonder if there's more. Can we send thoughts, or the feelings that accompany those thoughts? Can we just tone down the chatter without turning it off completely?""



John thinks back to the time he had Sherlock handcuffed in the bathroom and shrugs, sending the water sloshing. ""When I was trying to show you how I can manipulate Alphas during my heat, it didn't really work on you. I thought maybe it was because it wasn't a full heat. But what if... What if it's because I didn't really want to seduce you. I had no need, you were already displaying signs of submitting to me. There was no aggression to ward off.""



""That's very possible."" Sherlock hums and rests his head back against the edge of the tub as he focuses his thoughts and on his connection to John.



Slowly he divides the thoughts he wants to be available to John and all the other ones that don't need to be passed along. Soon the constant hum through their connection lessens by half as Sherlock's only sending what's necessary to John. 
He smirks a bit and decides to test it out to see if he can focus on a single thought to send directly to John. 'I love you'



A warm shiver rushes over John's body even as his mind quiets. He lifts his head and looks down to see he's covered in goose pimples from head to toe.



""What.. what was that?"" He says, looking over at the back of his mate's head.



Sherlock chuckles softly and turns to look at John. ""I focused on a message.""



""Mmm,"" John says with a crooked smile ""love you too. Also... Thanks. I can think a bit easier now.""



""I'm sorry. I know it can be overwhelming. I can't imagine what it's like from the outside."" Sherlock says softly.



""It's fine normally,"" John says waving Sherlock's worry off. ""Just right now, trying to piece together a puzzle that's all the same colour, it's a bit much. You must be sick of how dull my thoughts are."" He laughs softly.



""They're.."" Sherlock tries to think of a way to describe it. ""They're like how coming home feels.""



""Home is full?"" John teases, leaning over and pressing a wet kiss to Sherlock's head. ""Did it work both ways? Or do I need to do something on my end as well?""



""Not full. Content and safe."" Sherlock nuzzles him. ""I don't think you need to do anything. If you want me to hear something specific you can try focusing on it.



""Mmm. What about..."" John says, sinking back down into the water. He focuses on what it felt like to have Sherlock inside him. The stretch and the fullness of it. He can feel himself growing aroused as he focuses on the memory of their last coupling.



Sherlock gasps and arches a bit, his cock filling out quickly as John's thoughts flood his mind. He plays dirty, sending back how good it felt to be inside John and have his cock wrapped in John's tight wet hot slick body.



""Bedroom, now,"" John says, already rising out of the water. He triggers the drain with his toe and steps out, dripping water onto Sherlock from above. Neither of them seems to care, however. John reaches for a towel and gives himself a quick pat-down so he doesn't get the bed soaking wet. He pauses for a brief moment, as he leaves the master bathroom and looks at his parent's bed. It's a bit weird, having sex on their bed, but his need is great enough that he doesn't give it a second thought.



""Should we warn your brother?"" John giggles, as he pulls Sherlock down on top of him, ""or let him find out the fun way?""



""The door is closed. If he comes in any mental scars are on him."" Sherlock snorts and kisses John deeply, wrapping his omega's legs around him.



""Oh, I was more concerned with the noise I'm about to make,"" John says with a laugh while twisting his body and flipping their positions. He ends up with his knees on either side of Sherlock's thighs and his hands planted firmly on Sherlock's chest. ""I'm going to have you first, then once I'm good and turned on you can bend me over and make me scream your name.""



Sherlock's thoughts are flooded with how hot it is when John takes charge and manhandles him. ""Is that so? Going to take what you want from me, omega?"" He smirks, teasing.



""Damn right I'll take what I want,"" John says, reaching behind him to gather some of his slick to use as lube. ""How's it feel, knowing my Omega slick is going to help me fuck you?"" he asks in a gravelly voice.



John grabs the underside of Sherlock's knee with his clean hand and pushes Sherlock's legs back until Sherlock's arse is exposed. Ignoring Sherlock's cock completely, he slides his slick fingers over Sherlock's hole then pushes in. He wiggles his fingers, getting his slick everywhere before pulling his hand back to reach for more slick. ""Look how hard you are at the thought of being fucked by me.""



""Not my fault. You're just so sexy and hot and you turn me on so much."" Sherlock whines, holding his legs up and open. ""I want you to fuck me. Need it. Want you inside me. It feels so good to claim your alpha, doesn't it?"" He groans, his cock throbbing as he feels John spread slick over him.



""So good."" John purrs, sliding the tip of his cock over Sherlock's hole, though he doesn't push in. Not yet. He knows Sherlock enjoys this just as much as he does, and wants to draw it out until his mate is begging for it.



""Tell me, Alpha,"" he growls, pushing his cock against Sherlock's hole with just enough pressure to remind Sherlock of what was about to come. ""Is it better with my slick? Dirtier knowing it's my body, out of heat, aiding me in fucking you? Tell me, or I won't push in, I'll just torment you like this.""



""Yes yes. Your slick is so good. So delicious. I want to taste every drip. Love it when you fuck me with it, feel your cock slid in and out of me which your slick coating me."" Sherlock whines a bit, trying to press down more against John's cock to get him inside.



John grabs both of Sherlock's legs and pulls them together. He guides Sherlock's legs to both sit on his right shoulder, then with a single push enters Sherlock. He knows how much his mate loves this. How he loves minimal preparation, and the feeling of John taking him in one push. Still, John holds himself still until Sherlock's breathing grows less frantic. When Sherlock wiggles once against him, he knows he's ready.



""So good for me,"" John purrs, not caring one bit about the volume of their voices. Mycroft can either sod off to the car for half an hour or ignore them. ""Look at you, getting fucked by your pregnant mate. If other Alphas found out..."" he growls while snapping his hips forward. He wraps both his arms around Sherlock's legs, holding them flush to his chest, and uses them for leverage. ""So god damn sexy...""



Sherlock presses a hand back against the headboard as the other grasps at the sheets. ""Oh fuck, John!"" He moans, head thrown back as his omega takes him.



""If they knew how fucking good it felt they drop trow and bend over. Oh fuck yes. There!"" He moans, maybe a bit louder than necessary to annoy Mycroft but John did feel so good and he wasn't going to hold back. He loves how John's cock fills him, as far as male omega cocks go John had a pretty sizable one but Sherlock loved how thick it was. He may be a bit of a size queen but he never knew it until he took John's cock.



""Oh? Pretty boy Alpha likes his prostate milked?"" John says slyly, pulling out then pressing in with a slow slide, relishing the way Sherlock's legs tightened on his shoulder as his cock milked every last drop of pleasure from Sherlock's body.



""John John John John!"" Sherlock's thighs trembling a bit. He loves this. Loves how John can take him apart so easily. He loves John so much he can't even think. ""Yours. I'm yours. Anything you want. Yours.""



John fucks Sherlock with a slow and steady pace. Enough to bring them both to the edge without tipping either of them over it. He watches as Sherlock's cock, trapped between his thighs, begins to leak until there is a pool of pre-come on Sherlock's stomach. When John feels as if he can't hold off his orgasm any longer he pulls out with a wet pop and releases Sherlock's legs.



""Fuck me and make me come, Alpha,"" he demands while flipping over onto his hands and knees. He yelps a bit as Sherlock grabs his hips and flips him onto his back, but purrs happily as Sherlock nuzzles along his neck. This is better, facing each other. He loves the way Sherlock watches him when they're like this.



Sherlock holds John close, nuzzling and kissing over John's bite as he presses his cock into John. He nibbles and sucks on it teasingly as he rolls his hips, letting the desire for one another build.



""You like fucking me, don't you? Feeling like you have the power. That you're in charge. Pushing your omega cock in your alpha. Making me squirm and be for more."" He teasingly snaps his hips. ""But you're mine. All mine. To do with as I please. You do the same to me."" He presses deeper.



""All mine,"" John growls back, reaching a hand down and grabbing a fistful of Sherlock's arse. He wishes his reach was a bit longer so he could stick a finger inside Sherlock, but Sherlock's torso is longer than his, and his arse hole is just out of reach. So he settles for leaving bruises with his fingertips along his mate's hips and cheeks. ""I could flip you over right now and finish this, with my cock buried deep inside you. And you wouldn't stop me, you love it too much.""



""Mm, I'll fill you first, and then you can go back to fucking me however you like while my come leaks out of you."" Sherlock nips at John's lips as he rolls his hips, rubbing John's prostate endlessly.



John closes his eyes and lets his Alpha give into his natural instincts. He loves their power play, loves seeing his cock inside his Alpha, but most of all he loves this. Loves Sherlock taking care of him, even while pretending to be big and tough. John tilts his neck, presenting his bite. But as time passes, and he can feel both of their climax approaching, and Sherlock doesn't bite him, John lets out a frustrated groan.



Taking Sherlock's head in both hands he forces Sherlock's neck to the side while pulling him close to his mouth. His teeth sink into Sherlock's scent gland, he can feel his teeth filling the same indents and it's like sinking your fingers into memory foam. There's no blood or fluid, just... emotion and want. He can feel Sherlock's core like this, the things that make his Alpha tick. It's like looking at the inside of a clock and seeing the gears move, but not knowing what role each notch plays.



It's all he needs. His shout is muffled by Sherlock's neck, but he doesn't dare release his Alpha. Somehow, this feels right, to be connected like this to the man who'd impregnated him outside of a heat. His fingers dig into Sherlock's neck, and he realizes they must hurt but Sherlock doesn't pull away, and there's no discomfort coming across their bond. Thrusting his hips up once, allowing his cock to slide across Sherlock's stomach, he comes hard, and only releases Sherlock's neck when he fears his tremors might cause his teeth to rip flesh.



Sherlock can't help it. As soon as he feels John bite him he's coming and filling his omega. All thoughts leave his head, leaving him blank and everything quiet. There's only two things he can register, one being John's teeth on his skin and his cock pumping cum into John's body.



""Ahh so good,"" John purrs, licking Sherlock's neck as his Alpha fills him. ""So good, love.""



He holds Sherlock close, until their bodies stop shaking, then presses kisses along Sherlock's jawline.



""Every time we do this, I feel closer to you. I don't mean sex... I mean... biting,"" he says softly while running his fingers through the hair at the nape of Sherlock's head.



Sherlock nuzzles and kisses John's chest, his brain trying to remember words and how to speak without much luck so he just holds John close as he presses kisses to his skin.



Eventually, he can remember how talking works. ""You're perfect."" He mumbles softly.



""So are you,"" John says, reaching for the towel he'd (thankfully) brought with him. He cleans them both off then snuggles close. ""I wasn't too rough?"" he asks, knowing that Sherlock's body (like a male Beta) didn't take a cock quite as easily as his did. He always asked, wanting to make sure that his mate was okay with their power struggle.



""No. You were perfect. Your cock was perfect. You fucking me was perfect."" Sherlock curls up around John's belly, scenting and nuzzling it.



""Mmm good,"" John says happily, enjoying Sherlock's aftercare. ""I love being called your omega during sex."" He admits, letting his fingers dance across Sherlock's head. ""It's worth being an Omega if I get to be yours.""



""I'll make sure to call you my omega during sex then."" Sherlock presses kisses to John's belly. ""I don't know how your dad got anything done when your mum was pregnant. I can't even consider you being out of my line of sight let alone working or any other separate activity.""



""Excuses, excuses,"" John purrs, though he laughs as Sherlock nuzzles his head down into his stomach. ""Oi, don't squash the baby... He's still cooking in there.""



""At this point it's microscopic and it'll be cooking for quite some time,"" Sherlock mumbles against John's skin.



""Mmm,"" John says sleepily. ""Too early for bed?"" he asks, not knowing the actual time. It had to be close to eight, if not a little after. Early, by their standards, but his eyes were tired from reading all day.



""No. Your body is creating a person from basically nothing. Sleep is good."" Sherlock pulls the covers up around him. He lays behind John and presses against John's back, his hand resting protectively over his belly.



As he drifts off, John is hit by the fact that he's carrying a pup. Not just any pup, but their pup. He snuggles back against his mate and tries not to worry about how much baby-proofing Baker Street needs, or over the fact that they hardly had space for a crib or playpen in the living room. They'd make it work, he knew that, still, it was daunting to think about all the work they'd need to do before the baby was born. Worse yet, knowing that their preparations would be nothing compared to the actual work of raising a human being.



""Hush, everything will be fine."" Sherlock soothes, kissing John's head and sending calming feelings through their connection.



""Out of my head,"" John says weakly, though he doesn't mean it. Sherlock chuckles and the waves of calming energy he sends allows John to clear his mind and drift off.


These two just want to have sex non stop. How dare they, we have a story to tell here! -Tindo


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


Anthea looks up from the computer as Mycroft comes in, she had been alerted he left John's family home and had been waiting for him to show up ever since. ""Didn't expect you till the morning."" She hums.



""They were loudly expressing their mutual desire for physical gratification,"" Mycroft sighs, pulling his tie off and sinking into an armchair in Anthea's hotel room. ""Thin walls.""



""Shall I get you a drink to numb the pain?"" Anthea laughs softly, finishing off a report before sending it and closing her laptop.



""There is another way to banish the echoes of their... desire,"" Mycroft says, looking up with a single eyebrow raised. ""If you're willing.""



""With you? I'm pretty much always willing."" Anthea gets up and walks over to him, hips swaying. ""Here or in bed?""



""Anywhere you'd like, Sir"" rings in Mycroft's head, her first words to him when they'd first entered into this little arrangement. ""What do you want,"" he asks softly. His brother's constant worry for pleasing John had gotten into his head, and for once he wanted Anthea to have whatever it was she wanted.



""Oh don't you dare go and get soft one me now,"" Anthea smirks and straddles Mycroft's lap, her skirt riding up her thighs. ""I want you. And you're so good at giving me what I want."" She noses along his jaw.



Mycroft eyes her for a moment then gives a single nod. He stands, wrapping his arms around her back and taking her with him. He knew her, and her tastes. She'd want it rough and fast. He walks to the bed then drops her unceremoniously onto the mattress.



""Strip,"" he says, pulling off his already loose tie and tossing it onto the bed beside her, ""then cover your eyes with that.""



He leaves his clothes on, only undoing his belt and opening his zip. His cock grows hard, watching her scramble to take her clothes off. When she reaches for her nylons he stops her with a growl. ""Leave them,"" he says, then hums appreciatively when she doesn't question it. When she lays before him, his tie over her eyes dressed only in her panties and nylons, he grabs her legs and pulls her to the edge of the bed. 
Grabbing the sheer fabric between her legs he yanks, filling the room with a tearing sound. He knows he'll have to buy her a new pair, but the cost is worth it when he sees her shudder. Slipping aside her panties he lines himself up and slips into her warmth with a growl.



Anthea moans, her body arched off the bed as she takes every hard inch of him. She loved when he took her like this, loving how in control he was. How he knew exactly how to give her what she wanted. She knew it was like a game for him, playing with her body to see what made her shake and shiver.



""So hard for me."" She purrs, feeling him stretch her deep.



""Quite,"" He hisses, ""Or I'll rip your panties off and stuff them in your mouth.""



He sees her smirk, and wonders just how long it will be until she tests that claim.



Anthea licks her lips and instead of talking, she squeezes around his cock, massaging him from the inside.



Mycroft played Anthea like Sherlock could play his violin. It never ceased to amaze him how slick her entrance was for him every time. They'd never required lube, save for the one time he'd tried letting her top and she just wasn't having it.



When they both collapsed and spent, he indulged in a few moments of cuddling, understanding why his brother had embraced the seemingly pointless act with open arms.



""Thank you... I assure you that was not the reason I called you up here.""



""Oh? Well maybe that was the reason why I came."" Anthea teases, a little giggle passing her lips as she enjoys the cuddling. She rubs her fingertips over his arm, memorizing his freckles. ""Besides, we both know you think better after you fuck me through the mattress. Or over your desk. Or that one time when the elevator cameras weren't working."" She smirks.



They had been working together for ages. Mycroft handpicked her out of training because she was the most skilled of her class as well as the most trainable. She'd been his assistant at the start, his point of contact when he was out on missions. After he got shot she was the first at the hospital before he was even out of surgery and she stayed until he was discharged. She was the one who took him to rehab and even slept on his couch until he was able to manage by himself. She may be submissive towards him during sex because they both like it but that doesn't mean she's not a highly trained cold-blooded killer like he is.



""Right... To business then."" Mycroft says. The sweat on his skin and the cool air cause goose pimples on his skin.



Still letting Anthea trace shapes on his skin he lays out his needs then turns to her.



""Fieldwork... If you're willing. Step up from desk work.""



""Ooo letting me off my leash?"" Anthea smirks, her chin resting on his chin as she looks up at him.



""If a leash is what you've been on, then yes,"" Mycroft says, observing her with a keen eye. ""If you find it to your liking, we can discuss future missions, though I would be lost without you in the office.""



""Of course I'm willing. I'll look into groups and see where I can slip in. Being a beta has its advantages.""



She rubs her cheek against Mycroft's chest but stops herself. She knows if she enjoys this too much she'll give everything away. ""I'll do some undercover and recon. And I'll personally sweep the flat before they go back."" She says softly, knowing Mycroft feels better when she double checks everything the lackeys do.



""Mmm, and assign a team to create a secure website. We need a chat room, of sorts where people like my brother and relay information to us. As much as it pains me to say this, I don't even want to know who they are. If we know, there is a chance we could risk their safety. If you must create a database of names and addresses, encrypt it, and break the information up across multiple servers. Meanwhile, I need to return to London and look into Moriarty. Something tells me we're about to start hearing that name frequently.""



Mycroft sits up and reaches for the phone that will connect them with the front desk. He orders room service for both of them, then settles back against the bed to wait. ""No one followed you here?"" He asks, even though he already knows the answer. Still, he figures it wouldn't be unkind to show a bit of compassion.



""I'll have the Quartermasters start setting it up. We'll have to have some kind of verification to make sure they're legitimate. A questionnaire or something."" Anthea hums, biting the inside of her cheek.



""Of course I wasn't. But my flat is being watched which I don't appreciate."" She rolls her eyes. ""What I can't figure out is why is a Russian hitman sitting down the street from my flat drinking espresso and trying to tap my phones."" She says sarcastically and snorts.



""Espresso is far superior to a normal brew... and I hear your phone calls can be quite steamy"" Mycroft says smugly and smiles as her giggles vibrate across his chest. In a more serious tone, he sighs, and brushes a strand of hair out of her eyes, ""I'm afraid my brother unwittingly stumbled upon something quite dangerous. I overheard them talking, John's father was murdered, most likely over this.""



""Mm, next time I'll add you to the line to listen in."" Anthea teases. 
She frowns and nods. ""I'll see if there's an autopsy or anything on his father or any other documentation. Moriarty.. that sounds familiar. I can't remember why."" She gets up, walking over to her laptop naked and if she felt Mycroft's cum leaking between her legs she didn't seem to mind.



""Any information would be helpful. I don't want to tell John I'm looking into things. Not sure if he'd take it well, but perhaps if we find something, I can lead Sherlock in the right direction.""



Mycroft runs his hair through his hair and grimaces. He estimates they have seventeen minutes before room service arrives. With Anthea on the hunt once more, he has time for a shower. ""Call if you need me,"" he says, heading towards the bathroom.



Anthea joins him five minutes later. ""Jacob Moriarty was investigated some twenty years ago for a string of his omega's dying under mysterious circumstances. But since they were under his responsibility he denied autopsies and buried them in unmarked graves on his estate. We can't get an aerial view of the estate because there's interference going out to a five-kilometer radius around the parameter and above in the sky.""



""He was negotiating a contract to buy John's mother before she presented."" Mycroft muses, relaxing as Anthea snakes her arms around his waist. ""I've already looked, there aren't any copies of the documents, save one. The one where he forfeited his right to her as long as the parents returned the deposit, which they did not do. Though he never went after them.""



Wiping water from his face he turns and cocks his head at the petite woman sharing his shower with him. ""That doesn't seem likely for a businessman, does it? Leaving unclaimed money lying about?""



Anthea frowns and shakes her head. ""It doesn't. But all businessmen know how to get their payment. Maybe he got what he wanted without getting his money back..""



""Unlikely, but a possibility,"" Mycroft muses, ""Worth looking into at least. I have a theory, but it is too early in the game to extrapolate...""



Mycroft steps out of the shower, leaving Anthea to wash up. Toweling off he puts on his pants, trousers, and undershirt, then heads to the door. He opens it just as the waitstaff is reaching up to knock. Tipping the man, he accepts the food and places it on a small table.



""I'll return to London the day after tomorrow,"" he says loud enough for Anthea to hear, but not loud enough to be overheard should anyone be lingering in the hallway. ""Sherlock and his growing family aren't safe until this is resolved.""



Anthea comes out, drying off her hair. ""I'll never get used to how much you cum. It's like buckets."" She hums, pulling on a bra and panty set. ""Had to use the detachable shower head for almost five minutes to rinse it all out."" She nearly purrs but holds it back.



""I'll head out in the morning and make preparations. I.."" She stops thinking. ""I think we've been looking at this the wrong way.""



Mycroft's face begins to turn red at her comment, but as she continues he gives her a puzzled look.



""What do you mean?""



""If we think John's father was murdered then he's probably not the first nor the last. We have to look into alphas who died suddenly or under mysterious circumstances leaving an omega behind. It makes them vulnerable and targets. I'll get a report together and see if anything pops."" Anthea hums and comes over to the cart. ""What did you get?""



""You only nuzzle my face when you're craving something sweet,"" Mycroft says, lifting the cover off the tray, revealing a tray full of Petit Four.



""You know when you're good to me it makes me want to suck you off."" Anthea grins, licking her lips as she looks at her treat.



""Perhaps that was my motivation,"" Mycroft says with a wink, pinching a sweet from the tray.



""Mm, you should have gotten a can of whipped cream sent up as well. I would have licked it off."" Anthea smirks and takes her plate to the table.



""Lick? Mycroft asks warily, ""You mean bite. Or do you think I've forgotten the last time we tried?""



""You like when I nibble. Just not your cock."" Anthea laughs and eats.


Tindo here, trying to write a Mycroft we don't hate. So far so good.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          



His feet pound across hard dirt. Everywhere around him shadows seem to jump at him. The forest is dense. Damp earth and decaying leaves permeate his senses. He can hear them now, not just sense them. Footsteps behind him. Two, maybe three sets of feet crashing through the trees behind him. Not at all far behind. They'll catch up soon if he doesn't find a way out of here. He doesn't dare turn around, afraid that he'll stumble on a branch or root in the dark.





He runs, thinking of his children, his wife. Knowing they're waiting for him back home. They're probably sitting down for dinner even now, asking where Dad is. Their essence gives him a burst of speed and he flies through the forest as quick as his feet can safely take him.





He breaks free of the trees, and finds himself on a road, and nearly runs into his car which is parked just where he left it. Fishing his keys from his pocket he fumbles and nearly drops them. But even as the feet grow closer, he wrenches the door open and slides in, locking himself safely inside the car. He doesn't pause to see the faces of his pursuers. Who they are doesn't matter, just who sent them. And he already knows that. With shaking fingers he pushes the key into the ignition and turns it. The car roars to life, and an instant later a searing heat envelopes him. As the car burns, with him inside, he sees the faces of his children and prays that they'll be safe.




A scream tears its way from John's throat as he sits up. It takes him a moment to piece together where he is through the panic and tears in his eyes. A gentle hand presses itself against John's back as he begins to sob. He sits there, shaking, eyes burning with the image of his father's car blowing to pieces with him still inside it. While the logical side of his brain knows, regardless of method, his father died in hospital, it was still terrifying to see in such crystal clear imagery.



""It's alright, John. Just breathe. I'm right here."" Sherlock rubs his back gently and sends soothing calmness over their connection.



Gasping in huge gulps of air John curls into Sherlock, pressing his face into Sherlock's chest. In a broken voice, he explains the dream. By the time he's done his fingers are digging into Sherlock's shoulder in a way that must be painful, but his Alpha just holds him close. ""It, god it was so real. I could smell the accelerant used to feed the explosion.""



""I'm so sorry, John."" Sherlock kisses his head and holds him tight, scenting his mate heavily.



""Sherlock... make love to me,"" John says weakly, wanting to feel anything other than the wrung-out emotions his dream had left him with. ""Bite me, love me, make me feel better? Please?""



Sherlock nods and kisses John, rolling him onto his back. He teases John, getting him slick before he slides into his mate's body. He holds him close and rocks his hips deep and slow. ""You're here. You're safe. Our pup is safe. I'll keep you safe. I promise."" He rocks, licking and sucking on their bond mark.



For the first time, John lays still, leaving Sherlock to wipe away all traces of his nightmare. His mate showers him with kisses. On his neck, his jaw, his lips, even nibbling his ear a few times making John shudder. This closeness is what John needed, and Sherlock gives it to him willingly. It's slow, and perfect. John's hands ghost over Sherlock's back, and when Sherlock's teeth sink into his neck he sighs and comes in tiny droplets of come that drip from his cock onto his stomach. It's a far cry from their normal coupling, but as Sherlock rocks one last time into him, John kisses Sherlock's ear and whispers, ""Thank you.""



""Anything for you."" Sherlock holds him close, not moving away or pulling out.



""Not sure I can sleep,"" John says, turning his head to look at the clock, which read three am. ""Will I keep you up if I turn a light on and read?""



""You know I don't sleep much anyway."" Sherlock nuzzles his neck, licking the bite.



""Good, you can stay up with the pup when he wakes up at 2 am."" John says, trying to smile, but he's too shaken to put much effort into it.



""I'll take it."" Sherlock kisses John softly. ""We can make a nest and have some snacks and watch a movie?""



""How about... we make a nest and you tell me your hopes for our child?"" John says instead, ""Or tell me about your childhood. Something soft and sweet.""



""Alright."" Sherlock smiles softly. ""I'll get some blankets and pillows from the cabinet. Then I can tell you about grandmama and how we'd sneak away from parties to eat ice cream in the village.""



John nods and shifts on the bed to make room for additional bedding. When Sherlock comes back he helps his mate create a nest, then curls up with his back pressed against the wall of blankets. With a hand over his stomach, as if protecting the pup from unseen forces, he waits for Sherlock to settle in beside him. Their knees touch and John reaches out and takes Sherlock's hand, pressing it against his stomach and holding it there.



""It isn't just us now. I've been happy to rush into dangerous situations, blind to what might happen to me. But I can't do that anymore, can I?""



""No. Not anymore. Neither of us can."" Sherlock rubs John's hip. ""We have adult responsibilities now."" He teases gently.



They talk and cuddle in their nest until Sherlock's voice soothes John back to sleep. His dreams are less intense but drift from uneasy to forgettable.



Sherlock stays awake, scenting John and keeps John's bad dreams away as much as he can. He rubs John's belly gently, needing some kind of connection to their pup. He keeps his racing thoughts to himself so as not to disturb John. He has multiple theories running through his head but he needs more data to make a solid story. 


Short chapter is short. It was just a good place to break up the big block of text we have. Sometimes they pan out to be longer chapters, others end up short like this guy.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

When they finally leave John's parents' house they pack all the notes and books and everything from the house they may need or don't want to leave behind. They're driven by one of Mycroft's minions at first to Sherlock's annoyance but then it gives him more time to cuddle John and rub his belly.

When they arrive back at Baker Street he notices things have been moved and touched, no doubt the flat and whole building having been swept through multiple times by Mycroft's agents if not Mycroft himself.

Sherlock helps John organize all their findings. He starts to make a timeline of events through John's parent's letters and notes, thankful for John's mother's meticulous note keeping and journals. He likes reading about what John was like when he was younger and how he changed as he grew from a pup to a toddler to a small child.

He ignores Lestrade's calls for cases as they already have a case and they're supposed to be keeping a low profile. He and John argue whether or not they should take a case because they're supposed to be looking like they've given up on the whole soulmate case.

Sherlock caves rather quickly, not wanting to see his omega upset, and decides to take a small case just to make a show of being out as if they've given up on what happened at John's house.

Meanwhile, Anthea works tirelessly to get the secure omega site open and completely encrypted. She works closely with some other colleagues as well as interviews as many omega's and omega groups as she can.

Three days after Sherlock and John have come home to Baker Street Anthea has thick files of data for them to go through. She also has autopsy reports of every mysterious, sudden, or unexplained alpha death that left a widowed omega going back before John and Sherlock were even born.

John stands staring at the wall behind the sofa. He has one hand in his hair and the other on his stomach, absently rubbing small circles through his shirt. Sherlock is hunched over a laptop, he thinks.

Something has been bothering John but until now he hadn't been able to put a finger on it. But with the timeline completely he can see it now.

""Moriarty. That word, or name, keeps popping up. It's safe to assume it's a name, as there's always the initial J before it, like Jacobs Moriarty.""

He turns to make sure Sherlock is listening.

""What if it's a family of J Moriarty. It can't be the same person. This stretches back years before us. But how does that help? What is this, a sick and twisted family business? *Saving* Omegas after their mates die?""

""Maybe Jacobshad a child with one of his omega's and passed down the family business."" Sherlock hums.

""Forced breeding... Then take the child from the omega more likely."" John growls deep in his chest.

Sherlock gets up and goes to John, pressing against his back. ""It's alright. We'll solve this so no one has to endure it again.""

""Mmm,"" John says leaning back against his mate. ""Before I start showing would be nice... Can't imagine chasing after you once my center of gravity shifts""

""I would like to have everything settled and wrapped up before you give birth. Court and sentencing include."" Sherlock scents John, resting his hand on his belly.

""How long can I go before you push me into making my first appointment?""

""Considering I've already made one for you for tomorrow afternoon at a private secure clinic I'd say a little over twenty-seven hours."" Sherlock kisses John's neck, he had noticed John's scent changing again and it concerned him.

""Mmm, I'm busy tomorrow."" John wrinkles his nose but there's no real heat in his words.

He looks at the timeline and groans. ""All I see is a line of omegas losing their mates, then half of them, the younger ones, go missing before they have a chance to get over their grieving period.""

""Don't worry. I know a good detective to track you down."" Sherlock chuckles softly.

He hums softly, his mind turning over John's words. ""Grieving period.. grieving period... Grieving period!"" He says suddenly, going back to a stack of papers.

""What?"" John asks, watching Sherlock search frantically through the mess. ""What did I miss?""

""Paperwork. It's always the bloody paperwork."" Sherlock finds a pattern. ""From the time an alpha does until the omega because the responsibility of the closest related alpha is three days. It takes time for the paperwork to get processed after the death and the legal requirements to transfer to the closest alpha. All the omega's go missing within those three days. Those three days when the omega's are completely alone and unprotected legally and probably otherwise as well.""

""What does this mean, Sherlock?"" John gets an uneasy feeling in his gut as he watches his mate. ""So they're kidnapped? They don't just... Go off and kill themselves from grief?""

Sherlock shakes his. ""No. No, I don't think so. And since they're not allowed to be basically anything without an alpha's approval they couldn't do anything for themselves. I think they were taken..""

""Are we looking at two cases here? Or... is this all connected?""

John sits and runs a hand through his hair. It wasn't unheard of for Omegas to go missing, but there was an unspoken rule that after an Alpha passed, they would be given a short time to grieve while the government worked out who's family would take over legal rights.

""Is Moriarty involved in any of those Omega's lives, before they bonded? Are they soulmates? I'm so sick of finding more questions than answers.""

""I.."" Sherlock thinks. He's careful of what he tells John, knowing John is already stressed and doesn't want that to hurt his mate or their pup.

""Out with it,"" John says, getting up and heading into their kitchen. ""I know that look, and you think better talking out loud. I'll make tea. There's almost nothing tea can't cure.""

""I think there's an underground omega trafficking ring that gets their supply of omega's from killing their alpha and then kidnapping the omega to sell to the highest bidder."" Sherlock frowns.

""But why go through all the trouble?"" John starts to say. But as he places the teabags, decaf for him, into a cup he starts to understand, ""Because no one will go looking for them. Not under those circumstances...""

""Exactly unless the family really wanted to maintain control over the omega then they would be taken right away into the next alphas custody."" Sherlock frowns.

""What were the cabbies' words, before he died? His exact wording... He said he had a sponsor?"" John asks, bringing Sherlock his tea and settling into his chair, his mother's blanket now draped over the back replacing the old afghan. ""So, like a AA sponsor? Someone who... what? Encouraged him to murder? Then he dropped Moriarty's name. Murder isn't a far cry from trafficking."" John blows on his tea then takes a sip, mulling over the idea in his head. ""We need to find out more about this Jacobs Moriarty.""

""Maybe he helped murder the alphas and then drove the omega's to wherever they needed to go."" Sherlock hums.

John watched Sherlock work until the sun had long set. He ate dinner alone, though he managed to coax Sherlock into a few bites while Sherlock laid on the couch, his head nuzzling John's stomach, helping ward off the queasy feeling John still got when he ate. When he couldn't keep his eyes open any longer, he kissed the back of Sherlock's head and padded off to the bedroom. Sherlock joined him sometime after 1am, and wrapped his arms around John's back, muttering about Moriarty and how he must have another man who could grab the Omegas unseen.

He managed to get himself so absorbed in the book that he could finally stop thinking about him. He was halfway through the book when his perfect evening was interrupted by someone knocking on his door.

His first thought out of habit was the new case. But there were no cases anymore. He'd stopped taking cases from the police since the event of the rift. Not when there was no more Sherlock Holmes to work for. And now his thought circled back to him again. Great.

He was about to ignore them and pretend no one home if not for the person's annoyingly insistent knocking. He got up from the couch and went to the door with a groan.  

John was not prepared when Sherlock's older daughter was staring at him at the door. He hadn't seen her for the entire month after the rift. After that dinner.

""What do you want from us?"" She demanded from the doorstep. John frowned, confused.

""You've just knocked on my door and asked me what I want. I think that's my line.""

""I went to pay my rent today and Mrs. Hudson said it was already paid. I can't think of anyone else. So tell me, what do you want in return?""

John sighed and stepped aside, opening his door for her. ""Come in.""

He led her deep into the house, to the living room, and motioned her to sit on the armchair. He went about and came back to put some wood in the fireplace. The crackling sound felt satisfying to his ear. He set himself comfortably on the couch again. All the while he could feel the girl's eyes on him the whole time.

""Watson!"" Bea finally spoke. ""What do you want from us?""

""Do I look like someone who needs your help now?""

""But you paid for our rent."" She suddenly seemed uncertain. ""You paid our rent, didn't you?""   

""Yes. But I don't want anything from you.""

""Then why?""

John shrugged. ""You deserve it.""

When Bea just stared at him with a skeptical look in her eyes John sighed. ""Look, I know I've not been... treating you very well. But you knew there were urgent matters happening at the time so we didn't actually have time to... talk.""

""So you want to talk?""

""Only if you want to.""

""About what?""

""Anything.""

She was silent for a while. John was waiting for her to speak. The crackling sound from the fireplace was absolutely soothing.

""Can I ask you something about him then?"" Bea said carefully. John took a deep breath. But after everything, she definitely deserved it. So he nodded.

""For all those years, did he ever mention...?"" She swallowed and licked her lip, clearly anxious about the topic. ""When you first recruited us... Did he know?""

""Did you actually think he would care?"" The power the question held hung heavily in the air after he'd said it. It weighed down both of their heart. John knew from the look in Bea's eyes that the girl was hurt by the sheer fact. And John regretted saying it instantly. Regretted causing her more pain after all they had been through.

John wouldn't blame him. Sherlock was deep in his own misery to be able to care for anyone, not even himself. He knew of the utter incapacity of himself to take care of his children so he gave them away, trusting in the hands of the betters.

However, John did not mean that he was happy with what Sherlock chose to do with his daughters. John was willing to raise them with him and provide all the help he could give only if Sherlock would let him. Only if Sherlock could just see him. That he was there with him when Alice was gone. Had always been there through thick and thin with him from the very beginning. And would continue to be there for him for the rest of the time. Only if he could just see that.

No matter how willing John was to keep the children, he had no say to that. Sherlock was the father. John was just his business partner, his friend, nothing more.

""Are you saying that you care, Watson?"" Bea's voice pulled him to the present. She was watching him with the judging eyes, always so doubtful, always not so easily trusting.

John couldn't help a little smirk. ""What do you think?""

Bea studied his face fiercely before giving the answer. ""The information still not sufficient. I'll need to gather more in order to conclude.""

John could only cocked his head to that. What more could he say? It wasn't like he would outright admit that so easily.

""Well,"" Bea continued. ""Sorry that it's a bit hard to believe that you care, you know."" She didn't look at him anymore. Her eyes flicked to the fire in the hearth. ""When you seemed to know how difficult our lives were, how hard we were struggling to live. How hard finding a roof over our heads.""

""Who do you think recommended Mrs. Hudson's cellar to you?""

She looked back at him instantly and then frowned. ""It was a boy I once worked with at one job.""

""Who do you think told that boy to tell you of that place? And did you really think Mrs. Hudson would let a group of street kids with barely enough money for a month rent the place without question?""

Bea's eyes were wide in surprise. ""Have you been stalking us?""

""No."" John leaned back against the back of the couch. ""We - Sherlock and I - had a group of street kids we occasionally used to gain information from the places -""

""That's not suitable for the people like you,"" Bea interrupted.

""Not only that."" John continued. ""Nothing paranormal or supernatural regarding the use of these kids. Just plain information. You wouldn't believe how fast news spread among the streets -""

""I wouldn't believe?"" Bea was looking at him. Unbelievable, she said through her facial expression. John glared warningly at her to shut up. Then he continued.

""His own personal network as he called it. That's why I was able to find you even when you were constantly moving from place to place.""

""Have you been stalking us?"" Bea asked again. Seriously, couldn't she just believe what he said for once?

John looked her dead in the eyes. ""I was... looking out for you. Just checking on you from time to time. Not stalking you. Especially after seeing that you'd found your own family.""

""I've done marvelously without any parents, don't you think?"" She must have wanted it to come out as sarcastic. But her tone of voice lacked the intent.

So John just simply answered. ""Yes, you have. But you would do better with one.""

John could not believe himself that he was doing this. All he thought was that the apartment was so quiet when living alone. He had never been alone since he'd moved in with Sherlock.

For once in this night, Bea was speechless. She was looking at him with a lot of questions dancing in her eyes, thinking, calculating, doubting. Then there was a flicker of hope. And then fear. And then understanding. And at last, the determination.

""I don't think that you actually want this, Watson. I don't think you really want us to be your family. I think you are just lonely.""

Now she'd just rendered him speechless. Like a slap in the face. A bucket of freezing water over his head. John swiftly got up from his seat. Suddenly needed a drink.

""We can be your friends."" Bea's voice stopped him as he was about to walk across the room. He turned to her. ""Did you actually mean it when you said to me earlier that you're not going anywhere?""

John held her gaze, swallowing the lump in his throat before he could breathe the words out. ""Yes, I meant it.""

To his astonishment, Bea smiled at him. The real smile. The kind that made her eyes wrinkle.

""Then I'll be there for you, too, Watson. You don't have to be alone. We all will be there. As your friends.""

John couldn't help forming a smile that matched with hers. And then a smile turned into a chuckle when a flash of old memories rushing to his mind.

""What?"" Bea demanded.

He ducked his face and shook his head a little. ""It was just... He used to say this to me once.

Sherlock's voice ringing in his mind. 'You don't have to be alone, John. Why don't you move in with me? Besides, we will work the cases better if we live together. What do you think, John?'

""We are not him."" Bea's voice again pulled John to the present. ""We will be better friends than him."" She said with a smile so wide, clearly joking.

""I don't know."" John crossed his arms. ""We've been friends for just a day -""

""More like ten minutes.""

""Right. Ten minutes. How can I compare? Wait for five years and we will see.""

She chuckled but with a look in her eyes telling him that she'd accepted the challenge.

She rose from her seat and walked over to him.

""May I ask you for one more thing?"" She asked. And after he nodded she continued. ""No more talk about himfrom now on. I don't want you to end up like him, living in deep sorrow, sinking in grief.

""Being friends for ten minutes and you tell me what to do already?""

""I've just realised it was a bad idea asking about him. Also, I don't think that Jessie will want anything to do with him.""

""I can see why.""

""Should I put on a sign that says 'In this house, we don't talk about Sherlock Holmes' to remind you not to?""

He huffed a laugh. ""I don't think that will be helpful.""

Bea giggled.

""What about you, are you alright?"" John sincerely wanted to know. The last time they met, she was more than broken. But judging by the way her eyes brightened and her smile wider than he had ever seen. Her problem most likely was already gone. Which meant...

""Leo is back and he won't have to marry the princess anymore. I don't know how he did it. And I don't say that he won't one day get married ever. But this is... We will have more time to treasure together."" 

John smiled just for how happy she was. ""Great. I thought we had to put on a sign that says 'In this house, we don't talk about Prince Leopold', as well.""

This time she laughed.

""Ah... Nice touch,"" John smirked, looking his lover over and stroking the curve of Sherlock's bare arse as the detective draped himself across his lap. The fluffy, bunny-tail lingerie - complete with fluffy, white ears - was already playing at his arousal and he knew he wouldn't be able to resist the temptation much longer. ""The carrot, that is... Although, the tail definitely adds something to it.""


 


Sherlock's back arched teasingly, curving up into the calloused fingers of John's left hand, as he let out a hum of amusement. ""Mmm, yes... I'd hoped you'd like that,"" he answered, his icy eyes alight with mischief. ""Carrots are good for your eyes, after all... but, you already knew that, didn't you, Doctor?""


 


A light chuckle rumbled up from John's chest as his eyes raked over the man in his lap once again. He slid a finger beneath the blue silk strap that accentuated the lift of Sherlock's arse and licked his lips thoughtfully, pulling back on the elastic strap before letting it go with a harsh snap. The sound sent a bolt of desire straight through to his groin and his smirk only grew. ""True... I did know that, love,"" he replied, his thoughts drifting further and further away from the religious purity usually associated with the upcoming holiday. ""I believe I heard someone say that they were good for your arse, as well.""


 


The quirk of a perfectly manicured eyebrow signaled intrigue on Sherlock's part, but he tried his best not to let it show. ""Ah, did you, now?""


 


""Indeed, I did... Want to find out if it's true or...?""


 


Sherlock scoffed, his eyes narrowing playfully. ""You can't be serious.""


 


A full-blown smile broke out over John's features and he couldn't help but laugh. ""No, I'm not, but you can't deny that I had you going there for a moment,"" he answered, digging his fingernails into the fleshy underside of the other man's arse.


 


Hissing softly, Sherlock melted into the touch, his hips rutting eagerly into the taught muscle of John's thigh as he felt his desperation mounting. ""Hmph, only in your wildest dreams,"" he huffed.


 


""Mmm, you can say that again,"" the doctor purred, squeezing the detective's arse once again. ""You in lingerie is definitely in my top three sexiest dreams I've ever had.""


 


Another hiss slipped past the detective's lips, this time accompanied by a quiet moan. His thickening erection rubbed teasingly back and forth as his hips set a steady rhythm, but his satisfaction was cut short. A sharp swat to his arse elicited a short yelp of pain from Sherlock's throat and he glared disapprovingly over his shoulder.


 


""Not yet, you don't,"" John warned in his best 'Captain Watson' voice, tracing his fingers over his lover's crease as he tugged a bottle of lubricant from behind one of the cushions on the sofa. ""If you're supposed to be my gift, then it's only fair that I get to open you up.""


 


The double entendre was not lost on Sherlock; his hips twitched eagerly but he did his best to stay still. ""Then, by all means, take your time,"" he huffed, shifting so that he could prop himself up on his elbows. The carrot hit the floor with a soft 

thump

 as the click of the lubricant bottle prepared him for the slick coolness of John's middle finger brushing over his entrance.


 


""Oh, I plan to,"" John growled, swirling the pad of his finger around Sherlock's hole before pressing gently against the furled muscle. ""I'm going to turn you inside out and wreck you completely all without touching your cock... but, first, you're going to suck me off with a smile on your face. Then, and only then, are you going to be allowed to come... Do I make myself clear?"" he asked, fixing Sherlock with a hardened stare in order to assert his unwavering dominance over the situation.


 


The subtle spark of interest in the detective's eyes roared into a blazing fire of arousal and he chewed his lip, allowing his submissive side to take complete control of his actions. ""Yes, sir... Whatever you wish..."" 


 


John's cock gave a twitch of approval as the title rolled off of Sherlock's tongue and the tip of his own tongue darted out to wet his lips. The heat of the moment pooled deep in his groin, sending a shiver down his spine as he realized he had his detective right where he wanted him.


 



Well... almost...

31 days before John and Mary's wedding



""Chinese or Italian?"" John asks distractedly as he shuffles through the takeout drawer, jumping at the opportunity to sneak in some high-cal, greasy food. The wedding is a month away, and Mary's been keeping a close eye on both their diets (""I have a dress to fit into, you have a suit. If I have to suffer, I'm taking you down with me.""). A bit too close. ""Sherlock?""

""Yes?""

""I asked, do you want-"" John says, throwing a careless glance in the direction Sherlock had just been staring.

What he finds there is the handyman Mrs. Hudson has had around the past few weeks, installing new sconces in the kitchen. She'd recently come into some money and decided that, following the flat's fall into disrepair while Sherlock was away, the time has come for some refurbishing.

More precisely --and more to the point-- Sherlock was staring at the man's arse, hanging mid-air like a denim-clad pinata.


Oh. 


""John?""

""Erm..."" John squints, squints very hard, because what he thinks just happened couldn't have really happened. ""Yeah?""

""Do I want to, what?"" Sherlock asks.

""What?""

""You asked whether I wanted to...""

""Oh, right,"" John says. ""Do you... do you want to order in or go out?""

""Mary doesn't want you eating out,"" Sherlock says, and John has to shake his head to remind himself that Sherlock is very rarely aware of double entendres, no matter how unfortunate they are. ""You still have those extra four pounds to lose if you want to get into that suit.""

John clears his throat, blushing despite himself. ""It's two and a half.""

""Mary and I think it's four,"" Sherlock says nonchalantly, staring down his microscope. John would have let it slide if it weren't for a barely-audible chuckle coming from Mr. Perfect Arse up on the ladder.

""It's barely two and a half, and I look just fine in the suit,"" John says. ""Look, do you want to eat or not?""

""I suppose outside is fine,"" Sherlock says with an overly-dramatic sigh, standing up from his chair.

""Get on with it, then."" John huffs, stealing another glance up the ladder before he leaves the kitchen. He manhandles Sherlock hurriedly towards the stairs before Sherlock even has a chance to tie his scarf.

""What's got into you?""

""Nothing,"" John sulks. ""Just go.""









28 days before John and Mary's wedding



John pushes the street door to 221 with his right shoulder, biting his lips in concentration. The two boxes he's carrying contain the kits for making their weddings favours - ones Sherlock had agreed to help in assembling - are not heavy, per se, but they are big and obstruct much of his view. Carrying them from the car park was a challenge that demanded a good measure of coordination and side-stepping, to avoid bumping into unsuspecting pedestrians.

He balances himself against the wall, wiping the sweat trickling down his temple. It's been an unseasonably warm couple of days. Mrs. Hudson's kitchen is quiet, so there's no one to jovially greet him there or maybe, just maybe, offer a cold drink before he trudges up the remaining stairs. Looking up at them with a frown, he takes a deep breath and starts his journey upstairs.

Still grunting, he's far too distracted to register the familiar voice coming from the depth of the flat. ""Would you, er,"" Sherlock clears his throat in uncharacteristic hesitation, ""would you like some lemonade?""

""Cheers,"" a man's breathy voice says cheerily. ""Would love some.""

John freezes mid-movement.


Mr. Pinata.


He'd completely forgotten about him; by the time they came back to Baker Street the other day, the man wasn't there anymore, so John just dismissed Sherlock's wandering eyes as a one-time fluke. Or so he thought.

John, still frozen in place with his mouth hanging open, hears a glass placed on the counter; then he hears what must be the proffered lemonade being poured. There's a short, loud silence in the flat, and then-

""'S lovely,"" The man says, sighing contentedly. ""Did you make it?""

John nearly snorts at the mere thought. As if Sherlock would ever-

""Yes,"" Sherlock says, wiping John's smug smile.

""It's gorgeous.""

Oh, John swallows, his chest tightening. Bloody hell.

""Your name is... Rory?""

The other man hums in confirmation.

""I'm-""

""Sherlock Holmes,"" Rory says. John's brain is a hot, fuzzy mess right now, but it manages to pick up on the man's heavy Australian accent. ""Yeah, I know who you are. They say you're a bloody genius.""

""I don't know who they are,"" Sherlock says haughtily, ""but they're not wrong.""

Rory laughs brightly, easily. ""No Dr. Watson today?""

John tries to swallow again, heart pounding, and it's then that he realizes that he can't because his mouth is hanging open. He stands there, boxes in hands, looking back and forth between the stairs and the door as though even these inanimate objects would agree that this is... weird.

Should he... leave? Is he... interrupting? This is clearly flirting, isn't it?

""Dr. Watson's busy,"" Sherlock says matter-of-factly. ""Wedding preparations.""

""I suppose it's just the two of us, then.""

""I suppose it is.""

And it's then that John's brain rebels in the face of whatever fresh hell this situation is, because - Christ.


Getting married, John. He's your best man, John. 


""No, actually. I'm right here,"" he moves with a grunt to open the door, putting the boxes down - nonchalantly, of course. As nonchalantly as one can muster carrying wedding favors during a hot jealous streak for the person he is most certainly not marrying.

Amidst Sherlock's surprised 'John?' and Rory's friendly 'Dr. Watson!', he takes in their arrangement. Rory is on his knees facing the under-sink cabinet, wrench in hand. Sherlock stands next to him, holding Rory's empty glass.

""Am I, er... interrupting anything?""

""Of course not,"" Sherlock says, finally moving away towards the kitchen table. ""Mr. Adams here was just fixing the sink.""

""Oh, right."" Mr. Adams my arse. ""Didn't you fix that sink a few days ago?""

""I did.""

""I may have..."" Sherlock clears his throat. ""Thrown some things in there that I shouldn't have.""

""Can you believe this guy?"" Rory shakes his head in delight, pointing at Sherlock as he crawls back under the sink.

""Yeah, he's... something,"" John says, his voice edging on shrill. ""Is that lemonade?""

""Excellent deduction skills as always, John.""

""I'd love some.""

""Help yourself,"" Sherlock says as he sits at the table, examining a suspicious looking petri dish. Rory peeks his head out of the cabinet in search of something or another in his toolbox, sending another smile in John's direction.

""Hope you didn't use the ice from the back of the freezer for this,"" John says, rubbed the wrong way a bit, following Sherlock's dismissal.

""Of course I didn't,"" Sherlock says. 

""The things he keeps in there."" John says. ""Not for the faint-hearted.""

""Nothing I haven't seen before."" Rory shrugs. ""Was a Park Ranger myself back home. Takes a lot to surprise me. Ever been to Australia, Dr. Watson?""

""Just an overnight stop on the way to New Zealand,"" John says. Sherlock hums mysteriously next to him.

""New Zealand's nothing compared to Queensland, believe me,"" Rory says. ""Aren't you getting married soon?""

""Er, yes.""

""You should take the missus to Australia for your honeymoon, mate,"" Rory whispers conspiratorially. ""They do 'glamping now these days; you sleep in a fancy tent with electricity and wha' not. It's dead right in the middle of a nature reserve - very romantic. Plenty of exotic nature and time to do nothing much but stay in bed,"" Rory looks between Sherlock and John, adding a knowing wink, ""if you catch my drift.""

John smiles tightly. ""Yes, I think I do.""

""The Indonesian Indian cobra is the fifteenth deadliest snake in the world, and all the other fourteen are in Australia,"" Sherlock blurts, apropos of nothing. The other two men turn to look at him, frowning. ""Let's just say that given their survival skills, the Watsons will have a better time in exotic Brighton.""

John knows he's gone red, flushed from neck to cheeks. ""It was Mary's choice. She's never been.""

""Of course,"" Sherlock says, entirely inscrutable, while Rory nods amiably (""Brighton is very nice too, mate.'').

""So, a park ranger?"" John asks eventually, once the conversation dies down and Rory moves to pour himself another glass of lemonade.

""Yeah, right outside Brisbane.""

""How'd you end up a handyman in London?""

""Oh, you know how it is,"" Rory says. ""Got sick of all of those poisonous creatures. Snakes and fish and spiders. Couldn't stand them after a while. People getting bitten and coming crying to me about it, even though we tell them to be careful. They never listen.""

""Fair enough.""

""You know what the best way to avoid dying from a snake bite is?"" Rory asks.

John raises a curious eyebrow.

""Don't get bitten!"" Rory and Sherlock say simultaneously, exchanging a small, surprised smirk.

""Besides,"" Rory smiles, a charming, disarming, Australian smile that's very clearly not directed at John. His next words aren't, either. ""Always been good with my hands,"" he says before disappearing back under the sink.







There's a flurry of activity in Baker Street later that evening, with Mrs. Hudson bringing up dinner, Lestrade popping in to say hi and drop off a case, and even a client that scuttles away in a hurry before ever reaching the door when Sherlock makes himself quite clear he will not, under any circumstances, be ""aiding and abetting narcissistic Neo-Nazis.""

John barely registers any of it, what with the relentless alarm bells going off in his head.

There's a deep pit in his stomach, getting deeper with every passing second as his eyes bore a hole at Sherlock's nape. The detective sits on the floor with his back to John, gathering the last of the favours into the big carton box.

You're in trouble, a small voice whispers somewhere in the back of his brain. You're in deep, deep trouble, Watson.

""All done,"" Sherlock says suddenly with a lopsided grin, and John feels like a deer in a headlight. He hums, because there's not much else he can say in his current state, and watches as Sherlock gets up from the floor, walking away.

""I'm off for a shower. You can see yourself out?""

John can't feel his hands. He wants to say so many things. Pathetic, greedy, unfair things filled with feelings he should not be feeling, not a month before his wedding. ""Sherlock?""

""Yes?""


Listen, I know I'm getting married but could you please not flirt with the gorgeous Australian? 


(Oh God)


Do you ever flirt back?


(You should, you know. In another place, another time, I would have-)


Have you ever been with a man? 


(Bloody hell)


Have you ever been with anyone at all?


(Fuck)


Why now, Sherlock? Why him?


""John?"" Sherlock sizes him up, his eyes sharp and keen and curious.

""Nothing, nothing."" He swallows again. ""Good night, Sherlock.""








21 days before John and Mary's wedding


The next Saturday is Rory-free and the weather is a complete and utter contrast to the day of The Lemonade Incident, as John has since come to call it. Baker Street is freezing cold, despite the roaring fire in the old fireplace. Sometime last night the sky had opened up and it's been pouring rain ever since, dampening John's already-sour mood further.

He stares at the kettle, waiting for it to boil. While Sherlock and Mary have been obsessing over seating arrangements, he's been relegated to tea making due to his general moping about and grumpily voicing all the (apparently) wrong opinions.

The kettle boils, filling the flat with sounds of whistling steam and burbling water. Mary's hushed whisper travels from her place on the sofa.

""Did you ask him?""

""No, not yet.""

""Well, what are you waiting for?"" She asks in an urgent hush. ""Mrs. Hudson says he's lovely. I'm sure he'll say yes.""

John's hand freezes mid-movement; he half-turns squinting, straining his ear in concentration.


(I'm fine. It's fine!)


""He's in a committed relationship with a woman, Mary."" Sherlock whispers back. ""I don't think he much goes for that sort of thing.""

""You won't know till you ask,"" Mary says in that pushy sort of way she does that John had always found so lovely. ""And there's not much time left, you know. We'll need to know before we finalize everything. I'll ask him myself if you won't.""

""Mary-""

S""Please don't tell me the great Sherlock Holmes is too shy to ask-""

""Alright!"" Sherlock snaps, shushing her. ""Alright.""

""There's a good man.""

(It's all fine.)







John's not fine.








19 days before John and Mary's wedding


""I'm afraid I'm a bit under the weather today, Mrs. Hudson, Mr. Holmes,"" Rory says from the kitchen, wiping his dirty hands on a used flannel. John steals a furtive glance from his chair by the window as he types up their most recent case; an unsolved one, about a guardsman that nearly died in John's hands. ""Would you be very upset if I came back some other day to finish the sealing on the windows?""

""Oh dear, of course not,"" Mrs. Hudson coos, the same way she always does at handsome young men. ""I hope it's nothing serious.""

""You're too kind,"" he waves a dismissive hand. ""Just a little under the weather. Might be a bit of a stomach flu.""

""Yes, that's been making the rounds recently. John here is a doctor, you know,"" she says, dragging Rory into the sitting room. ""John, dear? Rory isn't feeling well. Any doctorly advice?""

""Probably best if you just leave."" John blurts over the static in his brain that seems to be ever-present in the presence of the handyman. When he looks up, he finds six pairs of eyes looking curiously his way. He clears his throat. ""To rest. And drink plenty of liquid, of course."" He huffs uncomfortably, slowly transitioning into incoherent mumbling. ""That's sort of a stupid thing to say, isn't it? 'Cause you can't drink a solid, can you?""

Sherlock's forehead creases in confusion. ""Soup?""

""What?""

""Soup is solids suspended in liquid,"" Sherlock says, ""so it qualifies as a liquid.""

John smiles sourly. ""See that? Sherlock here is a graduate chemist, so occasionally that's useful.""

""Occasionally?"" Sherlock turns his sharp eyes at him, affronted. ""I've built a thriving career thanks to it.""

""I should go. Thank you, Dr. Watson,"" Rory says, offering one last apologetic smile, bending down to pick up his hoards of tools boxes. Before he comes up, though, he doubles back, dizzy. ""Oh.""

""Boys, help him."" Mrs. Hudson commands them with a half-whisper that never fails to get them to do exactly as she says. Both Sherlock and John march quickly across the room. Sherlock picks one toolbox (the lighter one, of course, the wanker), as John picks the other. It's all fine until he straightens up, grunting at the weight of it, and-


Fuck.


He's betrayed by the telling sound of his back cracking like a twig, closing his eyes with a mixture of stabbing pain and embarrassment flushing up his body.

""John?"" Sherlock asks. ""Are you alright?""

""Ahhhr.""

""You're not alright,"" Sherlock says, and John hates himself for loving the hint of worry in the detective's voice.

""Oh, my."" Mrs. Hudson whispers, clutching her own cheeks. He thinks. He can't actually see her, what with his vision has gone black.

""Blimey,"" Rory says, quickly shaking off his own general malaise. ""Let me... take this from you, mate.""

""Mmm.""

Sherlock turns to him, admonishing. ""Always lift with your knees, John-""

""Mmmm-"" He grunts with pain as Mrs. Hudson gently leads him to the sofa.

""You're not a young man anymore-""

""Yes, thank you for the reminder, Sherlock-""

""Mary's going to kill you-""

""Shut up, Sherlock!"" John calls out through a haze of blinding pain and cold sweat.

""What should I do?"" Sherlock looks down at him hesitantly.

""Move the pillows,"" John grunts. ""And something for the pain.""

Sherlock nods obediently, turning on his heels with a swish of his robe.

""Wait, Sherlock, look!"" Mrs. Hudson tuts, pointing to a box by the fireplace. ""He might need that. You go on, don't let him go without it. I'll take care of this one here.""

""But-""

""Go!""

John listens to Sherlock's footsteps as he heads downstairs, shutting his eyes tightly.

""Here you go,"" Mrs. Hudson says, helping him sit up. ""Brought you some water, too.""

He takes the proffered pills and downs them, taking a big long breath as he lies back down. Mrs. Hudson sits on the table next to him, patting his hand lovingly. ""Is that better?""

""Mmmm,"" he croaks, his voice strained. ""Wasn't even that heavy.""

""Looked plenty heavy to me,"" she says kindly, and he can't help but smile at the goodwill. ""It's the wedding jitters, if you ask me,"" she stage-whispers, winking. ""You'll be as good as new in no time.""

""I hope so.""

""You men are too proud to admit that, but you must be nervous."" She says. ""I know I was. I was terrified. I kept thinking, 'Am I really choosing to spend the rest of my life with this man?'. Sounds mad! But he was the love of my life, Mr. Hudson was."" She hums. ""There was nobody else for me.""

John stares at the ceiling, his vision blurring with dread.

""You love Mary,"" she waves dismissively. ""You know what I mean.""

""Of course.""

""Of course,"" she nods knowingly, falling silent for a long, stretching moment. ""He's a nice young man, Rory is,"" she says with a side-glance. ""Isn't he?""

""Yeah,"" he says, his voice sounding unnaturally mechanical.

""He's been coming over a lot. I think he fancies Sherlock.""

John swallows. ""Imagine that.""

""It's nice, dear. So very good for both of you. You moved on, he moved on."" She smiles again, nodding. It's a warm, understanding thing. ""It's going to be a great wedding.""

John lifts his chin, his lips pursed stubbornly, holding back a deluge of stifled words; words he's been expertly pushing down for years. He looks up at her wordlessly and he wonders -- not for the first time -- if she knows.


Of course she knows.


""You rest, now."" She pats his hand one last time, covering him with a blanket. He resigns himself to the powerful wave of pain medication doing its job. Right on time. ""There you go.""











14 days before John and Mary's wedding


""Sherlock!"" Lestrade bursts through the street door to 221b, John in tow, rushing in from the mortuary after receiving a call that the Camden Lock Garroter (a locksmith!) was --to everyone's surprise-- found hiding inside a tree trunk in Hampstead Heath.

Sherlock, who'd spent the morning pestering Molly at Barts, had disappeared hours ago and hasn't been answering the phone since.

Lestrade is, understandably, fuming. ""Sherlock!""

""Sherlock!"" John joins the chorus, running up behind the DI; their adrenaline pumping through their veins, they take the stairs two at a time, excitedly.

""You'd better not be sleeping, you bastard!"" Lestrade says, ripping the door to the sitting room open; he stops in his place so abruptly John is left with no choice but to bump straight into the man's back. ""What the-""

""What..."" John recovers quickly, taking a step back. What he sees when he peeks over the DI's shoulder is so unexpected, so strange, he shakes his head like a dog out of water. ""Sherlock?""

""Don't you knock, Lestrade?"" Sherlock huffs indignantly.

There's Rory, and there's Sherlock, with his shirt sleeves rolled up and his robe thrown haphazardly over his shoulders. The two stand in the middle of the sitting room, all furniture cleared and pushed against the walls.

And they're standing... Close. Intimately close. It's then that John's other senses finally kick in, and everything suddenly makes sense. There's music. A waltz. And the cleared furniture, and Rory's flushed face.


Dancing.


Rory and Sherlock have been... dancing.

""Hello, Dr. Watson,"" Rory says, sending a cheery smile. Lestrade turns to look at John with an inscrutable smile that John really has to work hard to ignore, otherwise he'd have no choice but to punch the man.

Rory clears his throat. ""Looks like our secret is out, Mr. Holmes.""

""It would seem so.""

""What's going on?"" Lestrade asks.

""What do you think is going on?"" Sherlock says petulantly. ""Mr. Adams and I are rehearsing.""

""Rehearsing what?"" Lestrade asks, endlessly amused.

""John and Mary's waltz.""

""What?"" John frowns.

""Mary asked me to teach you how to waltz for the wedding, but I needed help road testing the piece before I take on that monumental, and dare I say impossible, task,"" Sherlock says. ""Rory's about your size and build. It was only logical to practice the steps with him first.""

""Oh,"" John blinks. Oh. Blinks again. Rewinding back through every second over the past couple of weeks. Oh.

""This is all very lovely, Fred Astaire, but we have eyes on Peters in Hampstead Heath."" Lestrade says.

Sherlock's eyes widen in surprise. ""I was right!""

""Of course you bloody were,"" Lestrade says. ""Go, for Christ's sake! Get dressed!""

""Excuse me!"" Sherlock says excitedly, tearing himself away from Rory who stands in the middle of the sitting room, shuffling his legs uncomfortably.

""I suppose I'll just-"" Rory points hesitantly at the door, moving past them on his way out. ""Nice to see you again.""

""Yeah."" John sniffs, watching the handyman leaving, perfect arse and all. ""Off you go.""







John spends the rest of the evening avoiding Lestrade's knowing eyes.







""You didn't have to punch him,"" Sherlock says, his voice deep and warm, as they reach the flat a few hours later, breathless and red-cheeked from exertion.

John giggles, a high-pitched, deeply satisfied thing. ""I didn't, but he's a murderer,"" he says, and a deep rumble escapes Sherlock. ""And a right bastard.""

""That he is,"" Sherlock says, removing his scarf.

""What are we going to call this one?"" John says, stepping into the sitting room.

""The Nestled Locksmith? Behind Trunk and Key?""

""Skeyletons in the Closet?""

""Good lord, John,"" Sherlock rolls his eyes imperiously and John can't help another bellyful of giggles.

""I'll figure something out,"" John promises and Sherlock hums contently in response.

John scans the room again, remembering waltzes and Rorys. He bites his lips. ""So.""

Sherlock perks a brow, curious.

""A waltz?""

""A fairly standard one."" Sherlock shrugs. ""At Mary's request.""

John rocks uncomfortably on the balls of his feet. ""You dance?""

""What if I do?""

John can't help a crooked smile at that. He straightens where he stands, eyes the man standing in front him from head to toe. Sherlock looks back, challenging, measuring. Of course you do, you bastard, he wants to say. You have the body of a dancer. A tall, gorgeous, broody dancer.

""Teach me,"" John says, spreading his hands invitingly.

""What?""

""You've been practicing with Mr. Handyman so you could teach me,"" John says. ""Haven't you?""

""I have.""

""Well, here I am. The real thing,"" he says, taking a step closer. ""Teach me.""

Sherlock eyes him for a long, tense beat, and John finds himself bracing for a brusque rejection, a cruel joke at his expense.

He takes another step forward, holding his breath, closing the distance. They're nearly touching now; almost, but not yet. There's a crease in Sherlock's forehead he can't seem to decipher, so he tries again. ""I've waltzed before, you know. I'm not a complete basket case.""

Sherlock swallows. ""Did you?""

""My aunt loved it."" He nods. ""Said I was her favorite dance partner.""

Sherlock's eyes narrow, sparkling mischievously. ""How old were you?

""Eight."" He says, pushing down a crooked grin.

""That's not very promising.""

""Shut your bloody mouth,"" John says, cupping Sherlock's shoulder blade with his right hand, reaching for Sherlock's hand with the other. ""And dance.""

""What do you think you're doing?""

John frowns, his eyes shooting up to Sherlock's. ""I'm- I'm leading.""

""No, you're not."" Sherlock shakes his head. ""I need to see how you follow first.""

""But-""

""Who's the teacher, John?"" Sherlock says imperiously. He gathers John into his arms, taking over the leading position.

John's eyes slide shut inadvertently, drawn to Sherlock's warmth, taken by surprise by his gentle grasp. ""You are,"" he croaks, all fight in him gone. Doesn't bloody matter, as long you stay right there.

""Ready?"" Sherlock asks, grabbing the remote control with a stretch of his arm.

""Hmmm,"" is all John can offer in return.

And then they dance.







He's downright bereft when Sherlock leaves his side mid-dance, taking with him the comforting wall of heat his body is.

He's left wanting when Sherlock moves to remove his jacket; has to pull his hands away to prevent them from balling possessively around the man's midsection as he steps away.

(He perks right up with the new sensation underneath the crispy-white thin fabric).

He finds -- rather quickly and unsurprisingly -- that he is yet again in very big trouble. He does not want to lose this precious access to Sherlock's body - not tonight, not ever. He definitely does not wish to yield said access to other people, namely bright-eyed Australians in snug, stone-washed Levi's.

The waltz is haunting and unfamiliar; there is something joyous in the melody, but every now and then there's just a tinge of sadness. It is a song of love and pain, a congratulation and a goodbye; it pulls at John's heartstrings, a perfect soundtrack for the beating of his traitorous heart. And Sherlock... Sherlock is a wonderful teacher and a beautiful dancer and he smells like sandalwood and freshly-cut Hampstead Heath grass and home and--


Shit.


Sherlock unfurls himself from John's grip again. He moves to the table, grabbing a pencil and marking something on a sheet of notes. John studies his back, using the moment to catch his wrecked breath. Sherlock's head tilts in concentration, and he scribbles another quick note.

John frowns in confusion. ""What are you doing?""

""An adjustment.""

""To what?""

""To the piece.""

""What piece?""

""The waltz, John,"" Sherlock says, and John's chest tightens.

""You..."" he starts, his face clouding. He feels dizzy. ""You wrote this?""

Sherlock's tall figure freezes at the question. He clears his throat and turns, scanning John's face in that way he always does when he can't be sure what sort of trouble he's got himself into. ""John?""

John wobbles, heart hammering in his chest. ""Did you?""

""Yes,"" Sherlock concedes, ducking his head. ""It's a... gift. ""

""Oh,"" John says. ""For... Mary and me?""

Sherlock hums. He steps back into John's personal space, coming closer and closer. ""Mostly for you. A... parting gift, of sorts.""


Parting?


""Oh. That's--"" He says, blinking hard against a hint of moisture there, slowly scratching his beard. Sherlock is close, so close it's intoxicating. John looks up, searching for the other man's eyes. Where are you going? His own eyes ask. ""That's--""

""John?""

He takes a deep, stuttering breath as his hands bunch a piece of fabric on Sherlock's waist, holding on for dear life. ""You're...""

""What?"" Sherlock frowns, shaking his head in confusion. Everything around John sounds drowned out, as though he has gone underwater and all he can think of is Sherlock's breath mingling with his. And then he kisses him - oh god, I'm kissing him - and Sherlock sighs (lightly, contentedly), and John's hands spread open, holding on tightly and pulling him down (he's kissing me back, he's kissing back).

The pull throws them off their feet and Sherlock sways, teetering forward (good, better, more, more). They kiss, and kiss, until last note hovers in the air, whittling out with a flourished finality that has no place in this moment, in this place.

The sound dies away, the moment gone. John comes up for air, rubbing his cheek against Sherlock's.

""John-"" Sherlock says nervously, breathing hard.

""Shhh-""

Sherlock's hands bunch just as possessively against John's back. ""This is-""

""It's perfect, Sherlock,"" John whispers, hugging him tighter. ""It's perfect.""

The words bring such relief to Sherlock, John feels his chest emptying of air; he leans his head against the crook of John's neck. They breathe loudly, raggedly together, both trying to catch up on the reality of the moment.

""Rory,"" John says, apropos of nothing.

Sherlock snuggles closely still. ""What about him?""

""I thought you two were..."" John says, attempting a smile and failing miserably. ""He's been all over you.""

Sherlock smiles nervously. ""He's not really my type, John.""

""Had to stop myself from punching his beautiful face,"" John says. ""Multiple times.""

Sherlock shakes his head. ""John, please. You know me better than that.""

""I've been so jealous, Sherlock."" He admits weakly, shame rushing through his veins.

""I know the feeling,"" Sherlock says, looking down and away.

The admission hits John like a lightning bolt, and he wonders if Sherlock will ever be able to pick up his remains from the messy heap on the floor. The decision (if there really ever was one) is made swiftly, like a band-aid ripped in one fell swoop. It doesn't hurt nearly as bad as it probably should, and later he will ask himself what his life would have looked like if he'd made another choice.

But that's all hyperbole, and in the past now.

John grabs Sherlock's hand, squeezing it. Sherlock's flushed and beautiful, and John doesn't want another minute wasted. ""I have to go.""

""John-""

""I have something to take care of,"" he says, looking at Sherlock meaningfully. ""I'll be back in an hour. Maybe two. Hopefully one.""

""We're..."" Sherlock says, worried-looking. ""We've not finished practicing.""

""We're... not going to need it,"" John says with a hesitant half-smile, shrugging into his jacket. ""You could write a new one while I'm gone.""

""A new one?""

""'A waltz for Sherlock and John',"" he says, grabbing the door. ""How does that sound?""

And Sherlock smiles, a smile John has never seen before, and he knows that for the first time in his lifetime of misguided, miserable choices, he's finally made the right one.

Usually, these days would be spent moping around the flat, having occasional mental meltdowns and the rare phantom hallucinations of his deceased flatmate moving along the premises of the flat, with his dressing robe dragging on the floor. John had to practically yell at his brain to stop all this nonsense

'God, I wish I had that memory-deleting ability of that bastard. Sure would be convenient to ease all of this'

The thought was accompanied by a vague gesture of both the blond's hands, waving at his surrounding, which was their flat. Despise cursing to forget all of this, forget his time with Sherlock, deep down John knew if he could, he wouldn't After all the memories were too precious to him, almost as precious as the man those memories were shared with. Bloody sentiments

'I guess this is why Sherlock always says - well said that sentiment was a weakness'

The doctor chuckled sadly, his left hand covering his face as he leaned against the wall of the living room. No sooner had he put his hand down than he caught sight of the smiled made by numerous bullets, courtesy of bloody Sherlock Holmes on one of his deemed boring days. Almost instantly, John felt his stomach twist in pain.

"" BASTARD, FUCKING TWAT"" He screamed, punching the wall in a fit of frustration, ignoring the pain slowly creeping in on his hand and the rattling of the wall decorations.

'This is fucking ridiculous. I was a soldier for fuck sake, I killed people, I watched my comrades die before my eyes, and none of that shit managed to break me and yet Sherlock Holmes with his bloody high cheekbones, icy blue eyes, arrogant attitude, mysterious black coat, snarky remarks, inconsiderate nature and that oh-so-damn brilliant mind of his did. I am supposed to be stronger than this. I am supposed to...

Before John could continue to battle with his mind, a sudden knock snapped him back to reality.

"" John, how are you today, dear."" 

It was Mrs. Hudson

"" No better than a man who witnessed his best friend commit suicide right in front of his eyes "" He replied, mustering a light-hearted tone to mask his real emotions, he even added to dismissive wave for good measure.

Unfortunately, Mrs. H here wanted none of that shit. Scrunching her nose up which made her eyes look squinted, looking like she was looking straight through his soul. Though not long after, her face dropped into one of sympathy and sadness.

John shifted his feet in discomfort and slight annoyance. He hated receiving looks like that, they made him feel weak and so exposed. Despite knowing the kind landlady just wanted to help him through his difficult time, it had proven impossible for John to ignore his rather negative emotions about Mrs. Hudson's expression

"" Oh dear boy, I know this is very difficult for you, given the rather intimate relationship between the two of you. Sherlock never had a lot of friends. Believe me, not many have that patience of yours to get to know him truly.""She started 

"" Mrs. Hudson, I have ready told you, I am not gay. Sherlock and I were never a thing"" John retorted. Truth to be told, He himself wasn't even sure if the words that had come out of his mouth were true. It's not like he was disgusted by the thought of being attracted to a bloke but this is Sherlock we are talking about, the one who always deemed relationship to be beneath him. The first meeting had proven and solidified this idea very well, to the point that to John, it was as blatantly true as the bloody solar system or other common facts.

"" Oh, an old lady like I can dream"" She responded playfully, waving her hand around in an attempt to lighten the atmosphere.

Not wanting to upset Mrs. Hudson and maybe himself, John only chuckled along with her.

"" Now since I have gotten you to lighten up a bit, here- she said as a bag of cookies was offered to John- I made a little too much . Might as well let you enjoy some goodies. And do remember to clean all this mess up, dear. I am your landlady, not your housekeeper, John""

And with that, she was out the doors, not without giving a last assuring glance at the army doctor.Closing the doors, John fell back to his robotic state, slumping against the wall

"" God if only you knew how people care about you, Sherlock. Always going on and on about being a sociopath, having no friends but you have friends , people who care about you. They care about you , bloody idiot .-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I care about you""


God, if anyone sees me now, they will think I am a complete nutter, mourning the death of my best friend more than necessary


 


 Ring ring  


John jumped a little in his position, before realizing it was his phone 

'Of course '

He clumsily reached for it to discover who would have the need to call him during the weekend . Definitely not his patients. The word "" Greg"" popped up brightly on his phone .Pressing the green circle  he bought it up to his ear, preparing to hear whatever that was coming

"" Hello Lestrade, what is it? "" He started 

"" Oh hey J-John"" The man on the other line responded  Despite not being as observant as Sherlock, John could clearly sense the shakiness of his voice and maybe a slight tiredness in it 

"" Lestrade ,have you been sleeping well?  "" The doctor in him started taking over. Really wish the doctor in John would also have the consideration to take care of himself 

"" Oh I-i am quite well - the sound accompanied that statement was a slurping one, which John concluded was Lestrade sipping on his coffee. He hoped it wasn't the coffee at New Scotland Yard as the coffee they offered there was disgusting  with its grainy texture and slimy sensation after you swallowed it. Sure it did its job well  providing the police with enough caffeine to get through the day but dear Lord , he was not going to have another taste of that solution that the officers of New Scotland Yard called coffee. He had tasted better in Afghanistan, even during the supply shortages. 

"" It's just that - Lestrade started again, albeit this time less shaky and more somber in a way - I have been having trouble with this case. My team have worked relentlessly on this shit for days and the progress are being made at snail's paceand we have just barely solved it . And now there is a new murder By God, I wish we had Sher- I mean him here . He would have solved this case in less than 20 minutes  I would even endure a damn lecture of his, telling us off as idiots Now with Anderson and Emalia gone , one due to family affair  one due to her child's accident, we are even more stuck on this case "" Lestrade stopped ,realizing he was rambling 

' Probably due to the stress ' John concluded and silently nodded his head in agreement  despite the fact that the detective inspector wouldn't be able to take notice of that 

"" So - John faked a cough - from what I am hearing is you want me to help you "" He suggested 

The one on the other line swallowed a lump down his throat. 

"" Yes ,I know this is hard for you. But I promise it will be quick  I just need to you to look around the case ,see what caused the victim death and anything strange. I can't afford to take another scolding from my supervisor. But I can't find anyone to stand in for the two at the moment and you're my best bet. I know this is a tad selfish  mate but I just need a few hours of your time "" Lestrade pleaded 

John was surprised for a moment, he never thought Lestrade would be this distressed to need help from him. Sure he accompanied Sherlock on a lot of his cases but he was always in the background, just a decoration, someone who could easily be forgotten. 

"" Lestrade,..  ..  I don't think I can-""

"" John please, I am begging you. You just need to stand in for Anderson and Emalia for one or two days ,only a few hours each. "" 

' Well it wouldn't be hard to help him ,he does sound desperate. I can't possibly leave him like this '

"" Fine , I will help Lestrade but don't come at me when I can't see anything more than you okay ? "" 

"" Oh thank god ,I won't ""

 

 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

"" Okay , Lestrade I will be there in an hour or so"" John bid his goodbye to Lestrade after the Detective Inspector had sent him the address 

' Well since I have nothing to do here, besides acting like a complete lunatic, might as well help Lestrade as much as I can. My therapist did say I needed to get out more often and not only for work' Thought John as he reminisced on his latest session


 [?] 



"" John, I believe some getting out of the house would most likely do you some good""  The sound of Ella's voice barely registered in John's mind



"" Believe me, I tried""  John responded, now rising himself up from the couch on which he had just been lying a few minutes ago to end his session. Bidding Ella a half-hearted goodbye, John took his coat from the coat hanger and walked out the doors. They had been having this conversation for three weeks now and it was beginning to drive him up the damn bullet punctured wall, but he wasn't going to lash out at Ella as she was trying to help him. It was her job and he was at fault for being a stubborn bloke who couldn't even get over these traumas despite having gone to therapy for months



 [?] 


'Maybe I am just too weak, too broken to be fixed'  The idea stung him sharply, more painful than the bullet that shot through his shoulder. Shaking his sandy blond head side to side to shut that idea off, he quickly changed to get ready to go assist Lestrade with a case , without Sherlock , and he was damn determined to keep all of his bubbling shit and turmoil together until he was isolated from the eyes of the public in the flat to break down in peace and weep his eyes till his heart was content, lest he be seen as weak or worse a bloody nutter. 

 

 

"" Here dear, some money for you to spend and have fun. "" A woman said with a sweet tone 

 almost too sweet  it was almost like those cheap candy handed out of obligation on Halloween and would soon be throw in the trash since even a kid would say it was too sweet, too artificial 

while handling a few crumbled bills of fivers and tenners to the young child, most likely hers. Having made the child accept the money, she put on a honey smile and pat his blond head before bidding him farewell

"" Just stay here and have some fun. Mommy will come get you soon after she and her boyfriend have had some private time together "" She said and then walk back to her car, not even bothering to wait for a response from her precious child or find out why he was carrying a backpack a little too big for his size and another bag currently residing in his small hands 

' Like hell you will' The boy thought bitterly ' I can obviously see through your lies, running off with your boyfriend while leaving me behind. How typical ' he finished thinking, wiping off the tear from his left eye but he wasn't going to beg mother to let him stay by her side

As much as he hated the idea of being left behind, he was definitely not going stay with his mother any longer. 

As the car speeded off, he didn't bat an eye at it and quickly went to sit near one of the benches of the entrance of the park, whose location was unfamiliar to him so he concluded that he was probably too far from his house so walking home was a no no and even if he could, there could still be a possibility of the house already being sold off to fuel mother and her boyfriend's addiction. 

Face turning into a grimace, he silent vowed to stay away from those disaster-causing things that can reduce humans to just a bunch of mindless, brainless thugs looking for their next hit .Unlike his once-was-brilliant-but-now-a-dimwit-due-to-drug mother, the boy was bright and mature for his age, too mature - well technically, he had to if he wanted to survive and not get taken advantage of by corrupted and vile adults 

'Honestly if mother is this far gone, I wonder how father is doing? What if he isn't even alive? Great another bad thing added to cons of being an accidental drug baby  '

' And the school taught me that a mother would never abandon her child. Yeah right, those sugar coating jerks' Lamented the boy as he looked out to the scenery of the park with people all going on with their lives so peacefully, so carefree. He envied them. 

' I might as well map out a plan since mother decided that this child is too worthless and expensive to keep, and she needs more time for her boyfriend and her"" Happy pills "" '. His pale hand started to rummage through his bag, pulling out a small paper. 

' good thing I managed to nip a map of London from school before summer break started. Never thought I would one day need this though. And the phone I stole from Mother should come in handy. But calling Mr and Miss police now will be risky and I don't think they will believe me, a child. I need to solve this before summer ends, I need to have a good education if I want to get out of this. I hope birth certificate would come in handy ' 

He remained still for arguably thirty minutes, just observing the scene and the people, taking in every detail of them, connecting the invisible dots in his head. It was a good stress relief, he admitted 

A loud sound interrupted his thinking progress. Turning his head around, the imagine of a police car came into view. 

' Brilliant ' He thought, optimistically for once 

' I can request them for help. Everything is going to be fine. I will be safe . I already packed up everything I would need.Honestly , If mother had wanted to leave me, she should have made more effort to hide that desire from me '

Packing his stuff like lightning, he leaped off his seat and followed the car's trace. The following didn't last so long as the car soon came to a stop before the middle of a street known notoriously for being busy, only that it wasn't today. And the large puddle of blood and many various others of lesser size splattered around may have contributed to this 

Despite the many people stepping back from the bloody scene, the boy just felt compelled to get closer and so he did, ever so carefully. 

 

If anyone has anything to suggest or criticize, please put it in the comment section, I am always game for some improvements, especially in this work as it is my first one

"" Okay Lestrade, I am here "" John greeted the silver-haired detective . And his eyes widened in surprise. 

Dear Christ and Satan's left pierced nipple, he looked horrible, like a piece of tuna drenched in sewage and then eaten and regurgitated by a wolf and then finally mixed with mud . Okay it was a bit exaggerated but you get the idea. 

' Hair messy as a crow's nest, insanely heavy eye bags, look like he is at brink of a bloody breakdown. AND DEAR GOD IS ACTUALLY DRINKING COFFEE FROM THE YARD ' 

John knew that Lestrade was stressed but he didn't know he was this stressed. 

"" Lestrade, mate are you really okay? "" John asked, once again his inner doctor Watson making a spectacular return

It took Lestrade a moment to acknowledge John's existence, let alone register the doctor's question but he soon got to it. Fumbling with the cup of disgusting coffee in his hand and a report file in the other, he went up to John to greet him

"" Hey John, y-yeah i'm fine. Just bloody dandy. "" He said, faking a cheery voice which was no way convincing and definitely didn't require a genius to look through that 

"" Lestrade"" John growled, activating his doctor voice, the one he always used when his patient was worrying too much about their pride and not being honest about their conditions and life habits, which was too many times to count, not even mentioning the times he had to use it force Sherlock to eat or else he would faint right after solving the case and you can guess who had the honor of carrying the world's biggest overgrown toddle back to the flat. 

"" oKay - Lesstrade finally fessed up - no, I haven't been fine. It's like all the crime imaginable just started to rise up the bloody damn roof after Sherlock's death . Don't even get me to mention the pricking damn scandals his death has caused, the yard is having a bad reputation for it and several officers have been put off duty due to bad conduct , which leave the remaining ones, including me to deal with all of this shit. And my record these day has been shut and Dearest god everything is so damn shitty with everything. The cases, the scandals, the news, the paparazzi * shudder* "" By the time Lestrade had finally finished, he was out of breath and was breathing heavily like a one of those genetically bred to be insanely cute but also ended up with breathing problems flat faced cats. 

John didn't know how to deal with this subject so all he could do was offering some condolences to his friend. 

"" I am so sorry for that, Lestrade. The news of Sherlock being a fake has really affected you badly, eh"" John nearly choked when he reached the Sherlock being a fake part. There was no ways scientifically or realistically that Sherlock was a fake. It angered him to see people think so lowly of his best friend.Sure he had a lot of shortcomings,. Sure he was , most of the times, an arrogant git who claimed to be above all emotions , But he was a brilliant man, who hadn't done anything intentionally bad in my life and he did care in his own way. Like the way he would always looked out for Mrs Hudson. 

After the fall, he began to despise Anderson and Donovan even more, knowing that they too had had a part to play in his dear friend's suicide. Sure they were just pawns in the sick psychopath 's demented game of chess but they were willing pawns so John's resentment towards them was, in a way ,justified. But he wasn't going to act out on his anger. From what he learnt, doing that always seemed to bite him back in the arse. And he had already had enough baggage to deal with, thank you very much 

"" Yeah"" Mustered Lestrade as he took another gulp of coffee, to which John internally cringed 

' How do the Yard even stomach that? '

"" Anyway I will lead to the crime scene, unlike others, this one is out in the open for all to see so we had to make sure no civilians will get close to it, especially children, They will be traumatized "" 

Lestrade said, gesturing for John to follow 

The crime scene was, as Lestrade had said, out in the damn open for all to see. Three people, one woman and two men, were found dead in their puddles of blood. The scene was discovered by a elderly woman who were walking her dog in the early hours. 


oh poor her 


"" Well pretty brutal. Any comment, mate? ""

John crouched down to the cadavers, examining one of the men first. Wearing the gloves the Yard had provided, he slowly lifted the head up, careful as not to disturb any other part of the body. The body had started to enter the stage of rigor mortis but not completely so the death could have occured only around 4 to 5 hours prior. He did the same to the other two, and found the exact same result , through the woman's cause of death was hard to determine as she had bruises, stab wounds , head injuries and also marks of strangulation around her neck. The woman was dressed rather lavishly, but the old age of her clothes told John that she was nowhere near wealthy, this couldn't be a case of robbery as their wallets were all there, through none of them had their IDs unfortunately . 

"" Well, the death of the two blokes were most likely caused by the stab wounds,made  antemorterm . The woman ,on the other hand , is hard to determine as she has so many injuries of various kinds . This doesn't seem like a case of burglary as their wallets are still there and the woman 's jewellery is still on her.

' Though I don't think they would be much in value as they look fake '

"" Honestly Lestrade this seems like a case caused by violent impulses more than anything, "" 

"" I see "" Lestrade responded almost disappointedly. John felt bad that he couldn't be more helpful. 

"" I guess we- 

Lestrade's speech was cut off by the sight of another person who was definitely not one of his team staring at the corpses at the pavement. 

' A KID???? ' Lestrade internally screamed 

The kid was starting at the corpses almost in a trance. 

Feeling worried that the kid had just been traumatized, he rushed to pull the kid away from the crime scene to both preserve the scene and the poor child's innocence. Dragging the kid to where he and John were, he held the kid in place, hand firmly on both of his shoulders, already to give out a shock blanket. 

' How did a kid even get in here ? ' he wondered, hadn't his team already blocked out this area to outsiders ? 

"" Kid, are you okay.? "" He asked in a concerned manner, shaking the kid in an attempt to get him out of his presumed shock-induced trance

Surprisingly, the kid looked almost unfazed. He just stared keenly at Lestrade 

"" I'm just fine, Mr Policeman "" He started, almost too calm for a kid his age, glancing again at the slaughter in front of him, taking in all the details. 

"" I was just wondering if it was possible that the culprits were among the dead bodies over there "" He continues, pointing at the scene. 

"" What? "" Lestrade and John started, looking at the kid like he had just grown a third arm and a second head 

"" Well, I'm sorry for overhearing what the two of you were discussing earlier, Mr Policeman. But you said that nothing of value was stolen so burglary is out of questions. I think this would be what they call a crime of passion. Judging by the lady's lavish yet quite obviously old and worn clothes, we can see that she wasn't quite wealthy but liked to keep up the appearance that she was. Her death could have been caused by many things but I think strangulation is out of the way as the mark is not very deep in colour so maybe she got it while doing bedroom wrestling, judging by some of the light and nearly healed bruises on her waist. "" He proved his point by directing the two adults' eyes on the lady's waist and sure to his words, there were some bruises there but they were most definitely not made during the struggle. 

"" Which made me think that perhaps this was just a murder out of sheer jealousy. Maybe she was leading two guys on and one night while she was with one of her sweethearts, they bumped into the other and a jealousy fit ensured, ending with all of them dead. There were some traces of skins and blood on both men's fingernails , Mister. I think if you get it examined, it may shine some light on this "" 

For a moment, it was like the whole world had collapsed, that reality was no more than an illusion. 

The silence seemed to put the kid in a uncomfortable situation. Clutching his bag, he looked up in worry 

"" I d-didn't offend you, did I, mister? I am so sorry "" He said in a frantic voice

Being the first to regain his grasp on reality, John shook his head and smiled at the small kid in front of him 

"" Oh no - little lad, this theory of your is brilliant but how can you be so sure? "" 

Beaming at the accident compliment and further inquiries on his theory, the boy cheerfully continued, forgetting the anxiety he felt earlier. 

"" Oh, I found something near the alley there "" He pointed to the alley nearest to where the bodies were discovered, which wasn't even ten meters away and tugged at John's sleeve to guide him to the place. And guess what they found there, near the alley entrance , a switch blade and a knife, all covered in dried blood. 

Still smiling, the boy continued in a gleeful  manner 

"" I found them and thought that the murderer couldn't have possibly be dumb enough to dispose of the weapons here and why would they need two weapons anyway. So I came to the conclusion that the two weapons were used by two different people and were left here quite recently , seeing how new they are. The lady and one of men 's stab wounds were much wider and gappier than the other man's so I thought that the lady and the man were attacked by the other man with the knife, the lady was the first to go down and then the man pulled out his switch blade, which he must likely carries for self defense and started to defend himself, unfortunately both of them died in the process. And maybe during the struggle, their weapons got knocked out of their hands and flew into the alley.And for the lady , obviously she died due tothe loss of the blood and one of the wounds was over her lung so it wouldn't be a sketch to conclude that her lung got puncturee and she couldn't screamed for help "" The boy rambled like a mad man 

After he was done, both John and Lestrade were flabbergasted . Did a kid just solve a case for the Yard? 

' How the hell did the Yard not check the vicinity for the murder weapon? ' John thought, now realising that maybe Sherlock was right about how most of the Yard was incompetent. 

"" Wel- well thank you for your help and enthusiasm,lad. But where are your parents? "" John asked, almost too eager to meet the parents of this great child and give them a pat on the back for being able to create a kid like this, although he would give them advice on how maybe some teaching social norms would be beneficial. After all, the kid probably gave Lestrade a damn heart attack, if his face was any indicator. 

"" Lestrade, close your mouth, you are trying to catch flies, mate ? "" To which Lestrade did, but that didn't mean that he was over the shock. Turning back the boy, John cocked his head and repeated his question, this time more friendly, even crouching down to make him seem smaller and less intimidating to the young lad. 

"" I don't have one anymore "" The voice was so innocent and matter-of-fact that it took John a few moments to register it and gave meaning to the sentence. 

As though understanding the two men's confusion, the boy elaborated further 

"" Mother left me, I was going to head to the police station and then I saw you and curiosity kinda took over "" He said, somewhat embarrassed . 

"" Okay then"" Began Lestrade"" Will you give us some time please, lad "" And he pulled John aside, leaving the boy to wait.

"" I think we have a lost child situation "" Both men started at the same time 

"" And John don't you think this kid looks familiar to a certain someone? "" 

"" What do you mean, Lestrade? "" 

"" Uh, nevermind. We need to get back to the Yard to file up the report and examine the blood on the weapons ""

"" And the skin under the fingernails"" 

"" Yes that too "" 

 

 

 

 

"" And about the kid? We can't leave him here "" 

"" Well of course,we need to get him to the Yard and we will figure it from there. We try to find his relatives, if it's unsuccessful he would need a place to stay,although I don't think many of the yarders would want to let him stay with them for the night. A great deal of us don't have even a decent flat . Lost child cases have never been common here "" 

Finishing their conversation, the two men walked back to where the kid , who was now staring at the other police officers collecting evidence, was at. 

"" Kid, can you come with us to the Yard ? "" Lestrade asked, well it was more an order than a request. 

"" The yard? "" 

"" New Scotland Yard, it's where us officers hang out and file paperwork when we don't have to running around chasing criminals"" 

"" Okay, but can I sit near the window, Mr Policeman sir? "" 

"" Sure, kid and call me Lestrade "" 

The trip back the Yard was rather uneventful, aside from the unexpected kid sitting near the window, nothing was out of the ordinary. As John and the boy sat at the back, Lestrade was trying hard to focus on the road ahead of him but occasionally would glance at the kid. 

' Why does this boy look so similar? ' he ponder. An explanation hit him right in the head but he quickly shook it off 

' No, it's impossible, but then again considering his history. Is it really impossible?  I need to make sure ' 


At the yard 


While Lestrade was busy with getting the report and examination of the evidence done, John was left with the task of babysitting a kid. Not that he was complaining though. The kid had been quite well-behaved, just sitting beside him reading a document that John had given him to entertain himself. 

Remembering what Lestrade had said earlier, John took a good look at the kid. He looked strikingly similar to Sherlock, only that this little guy was blond , his face was rounder and with a smaller nose decorated with a few freckles. He looked like what Sherlock's kid would look like if Sherlock had had any interest in reproducing to continue the Holmes linage. But that was unlikely  ,this is Sherlock "" I'm married to my work "" Holmes. Even thinking about the possibility that Sherlock might have a secret love child was ridiculous , even for John. Whatever woman that managed to get him on deserved a standing ovulation  but then again seducing a corpse buried six feet underground is a bit far-fetch, hell even when said corpse had been alive , the idea was still too ludicrous . 

So caught up in his thought , John didn't even notice the two little eyes that was eyeing at him for the last two minutes during which conspiracy theories were being concocted in his head. 

Snapping back to reality, he found two blue-green eyes staring at him. 

"" Your eyes are pretty ,Mister "" The boy exclaimed gleeful, with a wide smile. 

"" W-what? "" He could only muster  usually no one paid any attention to his eyes, or him in general. He was as plain as vanilla ice cream.Usually it had been his arrogant detective that had caught everyone's attention,   whether enamored by his aloof beauty or frustrated by his sharp tongue and even sharper attitude, hell ,in many cases it had been both. 

"" Central heterochromia , I read about it on the Net when Mother was gone. It is condition where the centre of one's iris has a different colouring compared to the border, due to the uneven distribution of uh- what did they call it again - 

The boy put his hand to his chin, almost into a thinking position. John chuckled, contrasting sharply to the calm and almost unsettling impression he had had on John earlier, the being sitting next to him now was just a kid, no less than thirteen, eager to share what he learnt to anyone willing to listen. John almost couldn't believe this was the same one that nearly gave him and Lestrade a heart attack when he showed up at the crime scene  ,almost like a phantom. He almost thought he was in the movie The Shining. 

"" M-me-melanin, yes, it is caused by the uneven distribution of melanin, causing the eyes to have different color within themselves. I have never seen them in real life, aside from my own ."" Pointing at his own eyes,which were a mix of blue and green, depending on the light,with a sense of pride like any child would when discovering something unique about themselves.

"" Yours have a ring of gold shade around the irises. They are so cool"" The boy finished with a gesture at his own iris to empathize his point. 

John questioned how it was possible that anyone would abandon a bright child like this to fend for himself . People could be so cruel , even to their own kin

"" Y-yeah  I guess they are. Say, what's your name  little lad  ?"" 

' Might as well get to know him better ' he thought fondly 

Almost in a instant, the boy replied

"" My name is Arthur Miller , Sir "" 

Seeing a child so happy at a chance to talk with someone really tugged at his heartstrings  ,John always had a soft spot for children. They were , at their core,  innocent like a white sheet , whether the sheet would be painted with bright colours or drenched in black ink and then stomped is unclear. In the latter situation, there was a chance the cycle would continue 


Hurt people hurt people


He hoped Arthur wouldn't become like that. No children deserve to suffer at the hands of anyone , less so their parents 

"" Well Arthur, I am John Watson, you can call me John .Mind telling me something about yourself? Like age or whatnot ?"" 

' Yeah that is a good enough conversation starter '

"" Well I am eleven year and 4 months old, Mr John


' So young '


-. There is not much about me "" 

The kid was beginning to tense up. John had seen this more than enough. More often than not, when he was examining children or asking them about how things had been recently  they often had a hard time answering, whether it was because of interrupting parents always putting words in their children's mouths or just general anxiety a kid would have when facing an adult . Fortunately  he knew how to handle situations like this. 

"" Well let's start out small. Where are you from? "" John reassured. When faces with such a broad question, some kids can be a bit tensed so it's best to start out small with casual question to create a familiar atmosphere first. And asking where the kid was from would give them  ,at the very least , an idea on how Arthur's home life was. This was very essential. 

"" I was born here sir, in London, have been here all my life "" 

"" And what do you usually do in your free time ? ""

"" Not much, when I get bored, I try to keep myself entertained,reading books from the library, researching things on the Internet. I tried to keep quiet so Mother wouldn't get cranky "" The last part was said in a lower, but quieter voice ,which made John's face drop but he quickly put it back on as not to distress Arthur even more. 

"" What about you , Mr John? "" 

"" Well, I usually just go about my day . Reading books is also an interest of mine, though nowadays I don't really have much time . ""

' Since these days I have been too busy mourning my flatmate and been going insane from the bloody hallucinations ' that part was left out for obvious reason

"" Is it really true that being a doctor is hard,  Mr John? "" 

The question caught John off guard a bit 

"" Well it depends. And how did you know I am a doctor "" 

Arthur tilted his head a bit to the right

"" You have the smell of medicine but not the kind that used to preserve cadaver but rather the type used to treat common illnesses like headache, indigestion,... The tone you use reminds me of how some doctors try to cheer up children before an injection. Also there is a chemical stain on your jumper. It smells like disinfectant used in hospitals "" 

At this point, John didn't know if whether to laugh or to cry.He could only managed a choked chuckle .The kid was like Mini Sherlock, only more polite and definitely less walls built around him. 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

"" That was amazing. Brilliant even. You're a bright kid "" John said, suddenly remembering his and Sherlock's first meeting. Those were the good old days.Hearing the compliment, Arthur's eyes lit up like fireflies in the dark, a smile beaming on his face, making him look more like a kid his age rather than the kids with the unblinking eyes that came straight out of horror movies. 

Seeing the kid up close now, John noticed how weird his clothes were,an old t- shirt clearly meant for thirteen-year-olds and above , an equally worn pair of brown trousers, topped with a pair of brown shoes and a knitted cardigan, all of which looked a bit oversized for the boy and frankly speaking, they all looked so worn , with some of the colour already starting to fade from his beige T-shirt. All of that made him look so small, couple with the fact that he was a tad bit thin for a boy his height. 

John felt his fist tighten. 

' What kind of parents would abandon their children? Why did these people even have kids in the first place? Could they have bloody bothered to put a damn rubber on or maybe pull out in time or better yet have birth control on hand? At the very least take responsibility for what you did ' .

So many anger-fueled thought were filling John's mind . He should be desensitized with this by now. Back in Afghanistan, it was not uncommon to find dead mangled, even blown up corpses of innocent children. Sometimes, you would be hanging around in a village, chatting with the locals, giving the kids there piggy back rides, making small talks and then BAM the little lads you were just playing with were now dead, gone. They had had their lives taken away at a young age, most had their eyes wide open and their faces twisted into an expression of fear and pain. When this happened, you just had to suck it up and grab the nearest thing to make a make-shift weapon and head straight to battle, sometimes even stomping on the exposed guts or brain matter of some innocent villagers. It was quite literally bloody hell.

No matter how hard he tried, John couldn't get the images  of those children's faces out of his face , twisted in pain and their body mangled beyond recognition, with guts oozing out like spaghetti and organs littered near the place they died.

By and large, John should be unfazed by this and yet here he was, worrying about an unknown kid ( who looked suspiciously like his deceased flatmate, who he may or may not have seen as more than a friend. Had it not been for his sandy blond hair and round small nose , the yard would be swearing up and down that he is Sherlock's kid.Like just put a black wig on him and the whole yard would think there is a secret love child of Sherlock walking around in plain sight and surprisingly not deducing and insulting people simultaneously) and getting all riled up about the possibility of said kid being mistreated. 

"" Mr John"" The voice bought him back to reality 

"" D-did I offend you? "" Arthur asked with worry in his voice 

"" Uh yeah, I am fine , just got lost in Memory Lane, nothing important, lad. So anything you want to ask about me, lad? I take it that the conservation have been a bit one-sided so we might as well mix things up "" 

"" Well I do want to ask something  , Mr John. How come that curly- haired lady over there keeps staring at us? "" 

Okay that was not a question John was expecting 

Looking towards the direction Arthur was pointing, John quickly located the mentioned being, which was. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Donovan. 

' Great ' John thought unenthusiastically

As if noticing that John and Arthur were staring back at her stalking arse, Donovan cautiously approached. 

"" Lestrade needs you "" She said bluntly

John merely gave a hum in response , stood up and gestured Arthur to follow him. 

Just as they were entering Lestrade's office, a distinct sneer came from Donovan 

"" Didn't know Freak had a child? "" 

It took John all of his restraint as a soldier and his good conscience not to turn around and verbally assault Donovan. The urge was tempting but he knew nothing good would come out of this and God's sake there was a child here. 

Entering his friend's office, they were instantly instructed by Lestrade to have a seat , which they did. 

"" Okay lad, I will just ask ya a few questions okay? "" Started Lestrade, already with note in hands

Gaining a nod from the young boy, he began . 

"" What 's your name? "" 

"" Arthur Miller, sir "" 

"" Age? ""

"" Eleven ""

"" What school do you go to? "" 

"" Chester middle school, sir "" 

"" What grade are you in? "" 

"" I will be starting Year 7 after summer ""

And so on, so forth, questions were answered. Personally to John, the process was too mechanical and bleak, not to mention too much pressure being forced on a kid. He could tell that Arthur wasn't feeling too comfortable being interrogated like a suspect of a triple homicide. 

Fortunately, the interrogation was short . 

"" Well, that's enough for now. Thank you, lad "" Lestrade said, reaching into the nearby bowl of candies , grabbing a few pieces and gave them to Arthur who accepted them, though the look on his face indicated that he didn't like the lemon-chocolate favoured hard sweet that he received. 

"" John, can I have a few words with you, mate "" Lestrade said and pulled John outside, leaving Arthur who was looking at the sweet with a disgusted look, which was understandable, I mean who even had the idea to combine lemon and chocolate as a candy favour. 

"" What is it, Lestrade? "" John inquired, a bit done with being pulled aside to have a private conversation twice this day. 

"" Well, remember how I said that if we can't find the kid's relatives, he has to stay at someone's place for a night or two and how I said most of the yarders can't let him stay with them. "" 

"" Wait - you don't mean ""

"" Yes ""

""Lestrade, I am not even part of the police. How can I? Why can't you do it? "" 

"" John, please, I know this is all too sudden for you, well, us but you're basically the only one I can trust on this. To be frank, I don't trust most of the officers here and the ones I do, I doubt, they have the space and time to look after a child. And we can't leave him  "" 

Much as he hated to admit this, but Lestrade was right. Leaving Arthur here was a no no and John didn't think that he could trust the yarders with the kid seeing how Lestrade remarked that they had never had this type of case before. Normally lost children got reunited with their families within hours of arrival, but what can you do when said child's family didn't want him. 

And it's not like John couldn't handle a kid for a few days, sure he needed to work but the kid seemed to be able to look after himself for a few hours. But John feared that he may have a breakdown while at the flat and scare the kid away. The last thing he wanted was to be seen as a lunatic by a child. 

After a good while battling his turmoil, his inner goodness and inability to watch a child be left alone won out. 

"" Fine, I 'll do it "" John said, letting out a sigh

"" And for the love of God and everything holy Lestrade, rest for bloody hell's sake, mate. You look like utter shit"" 

After John left with Arthur, Lestrade took a sip from his cup of coffee. 

' Taste awful but it does it's job ' he thought and then rummaged through his trousers' pocket to pull out his phone, dialing a series of number 

"" Hey Myc, yeah I know, miss you too, I need a favour, something surreal happened today... 

If you told John a few hours earlier that he would be taking care of kid for the next few days, he would have laughed it off as a bad joke and yet here he was at the entrance to the building where his flat resided, with a eleven-year-old child. 

"" What am I going to tell Mr Hudson? "" He whispered to himself 

 

I can't bloody believe that I have made it this far. Thank you beautiful darlings so much

Arriving at Baker Street, John fumbled to get his keys. Holding onto Arthur's hand to guide him the way to his temporary home. The boy looked around the building, eye changing director like the spin of a helicopter to take in the new surroundings. 

"" It's okay Arthur, you will be safe here. No one in this building bites, well there may be a few noise now and again but nothing too much "" John reassured the small child beside him, who seemed to still be on edge despite his reassurance. This was reasonable, John remembered how shy and nervous he had been as a child, especially when in a presence of a new environment. The sense of the unknown had always gave him anxiety. 

Opening the door to the flat, John guided Arthur inside, looking at the oh-so familiar place, yet it wasn't the same without the world's only consulting detective. And somehow this was made even intense with the appearance of a small being that looked  so similar to Sherlock

' Funny how human genetics work' John thought as he rubbed his shoes against the doormat, removing all the dirt and filth, before placing them in their rightful place. 

Seeing this, Arthur seemed a bit confused but decided to mimick John nonetheless , first getting rid of the filth and then setting his shoes next to John's. 

"" Well"" John started in an attempt to break the awkward silence between them 

"" You want a cup of tea, lad? Or juice? "" Said John as he reached into the fridge to find the bottle of orange juice he had bought a few days earlier. Since now there weren't any organs or heads, of any species, lying around in the fridge, John was able to easily locate the bottle of orange juice. 

"" Tea, please Mr John "" Arthur  replied""  Can I sit here please? "" , pointing at one of the chairs in the living room, John's chair to be specific. 

"" Yeah sure, go ahead, Arthur."" 

Hopping on the chair, Arthur tried to make himself comfortable. All the walking had made his legs a bit tired , but that didn't mean that his mind was. Far from it, his mind was spinning around, taking in the details of the flat, connecting the clues to better understand his new environment and his new supposed caretaker. 

Despite still having some uncertainty towards John, he didn't think he would be much of a threat. To be honest, he thought John was friendly and nice to him, maybe even more than his Mother had been to him, even if he was dangerous, Arthur wouldn't need to worry, he had already mapped out an escape route and the pocket knife he had in his cardigan would come in useful. He may not be able to defeat an adult but with his small size, he could inflict some damage to his legs and then make an escape. 

' Of course, I am not going to do anything to harm Mr John, after all he seems nice ' but Arthur knew people can be deceptive so he had to be careful. 

' Better safe than sorry '

While John was waiting for the water in the kettle to boil in the kitchen, Arthur looked around the flat. 

' Seem spacious for a man to be living alone. Maybe Mr John has a flatmate or maybe a wife ' 

Moving his head around, Arthur looked up and noticed the room upstairs had had its door slightly open, enough to reveal that it was a bedroom. Lowering his head , he noticed the door to one of the rooms on the floor he was on was locked. 

Getting up and carefully stepping to peer through the keyhole, he could barely make out the outline of a bed in the dark

' So a flatmate then '

Quickly returning to the chair, Arthur sat down, pretending to have nothing to do. A minute later, John returned with two cups of tea in hands. 

"" Milk and sugar, lad? ""

"" Yes, please Mr John"" 

Nodding his head, John added a little milk and sugar to Arthur's cup 

"" You know that you don't have to call me Mr all the time, right? "" 

Arthur seemed confused before opening his mouth once again

"" Isn't calling someone significantly older than you Mr or Miss a polite gesture? "" He asked, scratching his head, ruffling his hand through his curly blond hair. He liked his hair colour, it wasn't like Mother's and from what he had heard from Mother about Father, it was the same case with him. Arthur felt a sense of relief, as ridiculous as it was, that he was , at least, different from his parents in that aspect. He couldn't have imagined turning into a junkie like his parents.He had already had enough defects from being a drug baby. He didn't need more. 

"" Well yes, but sometimes it can be a bit too formal "" John replied. Arthur liked the way he didn't treat him like a little kid unable to have a single coherent thought or worse, a pest or a mistake. He hoped that there weren't some deceptions involved . It would be a pity if there were 

"" But I want to show respect "" Arthur replied , slightly pouting . He always felt uncomfortable referring to people older than him without stating Mr or Miss or Mrs. It showed respect and a level of unfamiliarity, which was perfect. 

"" Alright, lad "" John chuckled, settling a cup of tea in front of Arthur. It smelled nice, unlike the bitter solution he had made with the cheap tea packets he had found at home. 

Lifting the cup to his nose, Arthur inhaled a lungful of tea, feeling a bit relaxed thanks to the calming smell of tea. From what he had learnt, tea has a calming effect on the nerves but when he tried to make it, the taste was so horrendous that he had to spit it out. That was probably due to the cheap and probably expired quality of the tea packets, plus his limited knowledge on how to make tea. 

' I need to learn more on this ' Arthur thought to himself. ' It doesn't smell drugged ' he thought as he took another whip of the tea . Taking a small sip, it tasted good, very aromatic and didn't taste funny. 

' Then again why would Mr John try to drug me? He seems respectable. Though I have heard that human trafficking can earn one a lot of money but again he doesn't look like the type of scum to do that. He actually seems a little sad , if his aura and the slump on his shoulder when he walks are anything to go by. Perhaps he has lost a loved one ' Thought Arthur as he drank the rest of the delicious tea. 

"" It's delicious, Mr John"" Complimented Arthur as he set his cup down. 

John let out a small smile, it was nice to be able to smile genuinely after months of possible insanity caused by his hallucinations and his thoughts. 

"" Thanks "" He said hesitantly 

"" No really, Mr John. It's better than what Mother made. Despite being so proud of being full British, she is never able to make a decent cup of tea or even cook"" 

John felt as if he was about to choke. The kid in front of him was talking about his less than ideal home life like it was nothing, which made him wonder what kind of shit Arthur had gone through to be so... unfazed. But he wasn't going to pity him. Sometimes pity can make a person feel even  worse than they already have. He could say that from experience. If anything , he admired the kid for being so strong. Not to mention how aware of the situation the kid was. Not many kids know where to head to when they are abandoned by their family. 

"" Y-your mother was not a nice lady  , eh? "" 

At least he could offer an ear to listen to the other's problems. An sympathetic ear can make one feel better by being able to let out their frustration. 

"" No, I mean she used to be but she got messed up. She used to care about me but not anymore. All about her boyfriend and "" Happy pills "" . 

' Stopping rambling, you idiot. You're over sharing ' The voice in his head shouted but his mouth just kept going. 

"" I hate her, I don't want to see her ever again. I WISH SHE WAS DEAD "" As soon as the words were out, Arthur covered his mouth. 

John looked so shocked, his eyes wide and mouth slightly agape. 

' Shit, he's going to get angry ' The irrational fight or flight response of Arthur was going into overdrive. Why did he have to share that unnecessary detail. 

' Oh god, he is going to think I'm a psycho, a demented freak. Why mouth? WHY CAN'T YOU SHUT UP FOR ONCE ? ' 

Arthur started shaking, held his hands to his face, ready to cry out a string "" I'm sorry- I'm sorry -I'm sorry "" over and over. 

Instead of shouts or hit that he was expecting to receive whenever he dared overstep his boundaries, John gently parted Arthur's hands from his face, which were clawing at his face so hard that blood was threatening to leak out. 

Seeing the bright kid who had been smiling at him so preciously a hour ago curling up in a ball , begging like he was going to be beat up and mostly likely having a full on panic attack, it made John feel even more angry about the kid's situation, he didn't do anything wrong and yet was abandoned by his family. Oh how he wanted to give his mother a piece of his mind, he wouldn't even hold back on the swearing. This was full on child neglect and abuse. John felt horrified and furious how people can do this to their kin, their kid nonetheless.

It's like they were less than an animal.Sure there are some animals that would kill or abandon their young if stressed or endangered but human were above that, they developed morals, sympathy. That's probably why they are so advanced compared to the rest of the Animals Kingdom. 

Finally succeeding in keeping the kid from literally clawing his face away, John quietly sat beside the kid

"" It's okay, I won't hurt you, you are safe. Keep breathing. Yeah that's good. Breathe in, breathe out, you're doing great  "" He reassured the little soul that he was safe, no one was hurting. It's what John wished people would do for him whenever he had war flashbacks, but after an accident where his colleagues had been too scared or disgusted to even approach and just acted like nothing happened afterwards, John decided it was better to deal with this in solitude. 

Slowly pulling Arthur into a hug, John gently pat his back, rubbing small circles on its middle to calm the young kid down. Despite the initial flinches, Arthur gradually sunk into the hug, his breathing slowly calming down till it was at a normal rate. After a while sitting still, the young boy's voice broke the silence. 

"" W-why aren't you mad ?"" He croaked, his voice all hoarse and dry from all the crying. 

And seeing this just broke John's heart, he knew the world was a cruel place, and sometimes it's the innocent ones that suffer, not the bloody tossers that always prey on the weak. Looking at the boy's scared, tear stained freckled face, somehow John saw his child self and many other children who suffered from mistreatment. He understood the helplessness and irrational thinking progress that everything was about to get them, harm them, torture them. It wasn't death that they most feared, but rather the long and likely painful way it would be delivered . 

Struggling to push through the painful sensation at the depth of his stomach, John began to open his mouth, ever so gently and carefully, in order not to distress the boy even more. Panic attack is a terrible, irrational thing, it 's a caged, scared animal, ready to lash out and attack or run away from any hands that approach it, be it a amiable or a malicious one. 

"" No, Arthur, I am not mad. Like I said earlier, you're safe, I won't hurt you"" His words, soft and steady, really had a calming effect on the young boy, or at the very least, had stopped him from falling deeper into the panic attack and risking hurting himself. That was the last thing John wanted. 

Still hugging, Arthur clinged to John more, almost like this was the first hug he had ever received, which was true, as least from what the young boy was able to remember. Mother's hugs were never for him, they were always for her string of boyfriends whom she would bring home and have bedroom wrestling or do happy pills. That were what she had told him to keep him oblivious but Arthur wasn't stupid, at least he hoped so, praying that whatever damn drugs his Mother had put into her body while carrying him hadn't affected his mental development . The thought of being mentally underdeveloped had Arthur sick to his stomach. He , definitely sure as damn bloody gutted hell itself, didn't want to be one of those drooling, brainless kids unaware of the world around them. In some fortunate cases, people would just take pity on them, some less unfortunate ones , however, those kids would be perfect target for child trafficking , which either resulted in them being labour slaves or sex slaves. Or get their organs ripped out and sold on the black market. 

' It's a miracle that Mother didn't abandon or kill me sooner. Good grace, what am I doing? Being a damn weakling, who breaks down at the slightest sign of misinterpreted danger. How can I survive being so weak? ' 

So caught up in his thought was the boy that he didn't notice that John had let go of the hug, leaving Arthur to start to cling to his own limbs. Pouring a new cup of tea, John held the cup up to Arthur, who was starting to tear up again.

"" Here, drink up, Arthur. You need to replenish fluid "" John said, knowing fully well that it was a lie just to get Arthur to drink the tea. It was a trick John had accidentally stumbled upon during one of his times researching as a med student. It is said by researchers that evolutionary psychology dictates that humans only drink or eat when they feel safe, whether it is about the things they are consuming or their surroundings. By making people have a drink or eat something when in distress, it can help trick the brain into thinking everything's okay, which can help a long way when one's brain is always screaming that you're in danger. 

John may not be as intelligent as Sherlock but he still knew many useful knowledge to aid him through his life, whether it was about being a soldier or a doctor. It's amazing how his medical knowledge could come in so handy when being a army doctor during his tours. Guess it's quite easy to defeat an opponent when you already know what a human's typical weak points. Sometimes it stunned John how a human body can be so fragile in some situations and resilient in others. 

Staring at the cup of tea, Arthur accepted with hesitation, his hands still a bit shaky, eyeing John almost in disbelief, his facial expression similar to the one John himself had made when this brilliant child had managed to speculate a possible story behind a case, while the Yard hadn't even bothered to check the vicinity for the blooming murder weapon. 

As the young boy slowly drank the tea, John noticed his sniffling had stopped, so had his hiccups. After having drunk the tea, Arthur lowered tea cup, which John carefully retrieved  and placed it on the table , before pulling out handkerchief to wipe the tears from the boy's face. While doing so, he couldn't help but think that the boy was so like Sherlock and at the same time wasn't. The boy was bright and clearly had a bit of deduction skills, yet he didn't seem - how should John put it - so aloof, so emotionally constipated, which was good because as much as John admired Sherlock, he really didn't approve of the late consulting detective's way of dealing with emotions. 

"" W-why? "" The boy started, a expression of disbelief and confusion plastered on his freckled face. 

John only managed an equally confused ""uh? ""

"" I don't understand Mr John. Why are you so kind to me? "" 

At that moment, John wondered what kind of hell had Arthur gone through to make him believe that he was undeserving of kindness. John hoped he wouldn't meet the kid's mother or else there would be another kill hanging over his head. 

Clearing his throat, he responded. 

"" Because you deserve it, Arthur ""

A simple response but enough to convey the meaning

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

After comforting the young boy for a good half an hour, just reassuring and telling him he was worthy of being treated with kindness just like any other beings. 

That is, until a noise startled them both,it seemed that Arthur was getting hungry, if the growling of his stomach was any sign. 

"" Want something to eat, lad? "" John asked, although he was pretty sure he already knew the answer. It was getting late, around 8pm and he was sure that Arthur wasn't eating well, given how thin he looked, especially with those clothes that were simply a tad too big for someone his frame. John decided the best action now was to get him fed and make him more comfortable for the time being. 

"" Y-yes, please "" Arthur muttered, a slight blush on his face as the embarrassment seeped in, clutching his stomach. 

Going to the fridge, John pulled out some eggs, cream , tomatoes and leafy green before reaching up to the cupboard to get the dried pasta and some herbs and seasonings. 

"" Is pasta okay for you, Arthur? "" John asked, to which Arthur just nodded, still a bit embarrassed about earlier. Starting up the stove, John bought the pot of water to a boil , dropped the pasta and brought out a pan to make the sauce. First cream, then garlic, egg yolks for richness, chives, salt and pepper and finally a little bit of mozzarella to add texture. For the tomatoes, he simply grilled them to get them caramelized , thus more juicy and easier to eat. 

"" You're really good at cooking, Mr John "" Arthur commented, standing near where John was finishing the sauce and draining the pasta. 

John jerked up a bit, wondering how had he managed to move so quietly. Maybe that was how he had sneaked through the yarders at the crime scene, either that or the New Scotland Yard officers were more incompetent than John gave them credit for. He hoped it was the former rather than the latter

' Honestly, this is impressive ' John mentally remarked, in his mind he was already forming theories on why Arthur moved so quietly

' He did mention that his mother gets cranky easily . Could it be -' thought John before shoving those ideas to the back of mind, where they sat along side his complicated feelings for the late detective, although some curiosity still managed to resurface. 

'Now it's not the time to question him, I just need to focus on getting food on the plate. He needs time to slowly open up.' Concluded John as him dumped the freshly boiled pasta into the sauce and stirred for it to cling to the pasta. While doing so, he couldn't help but wonder how the yard would handle the boy's case. If they are unable to find any relatives to take the boy in, he will go into foster care, which has like a 50-50 chance of it being better for him than his previous home. He felt his hand tremble as the imagine of Arthur going into a foster home where he is ignored, treated with indifference, only kept for the sole purpose of financial gain and good popularity. It was hard to laugh at the irony of the situation, how he had just met this boy for less than 24 hours and already cared for him, similar to how a parent would. John attributed this to his doctor nature, his need to take care of people, not to mention the subject of his worry bore a eerie likeness to the person that he used to spend time caring for, most often after cases involving fights. 

' Maybe I can take him in ' the thought appeared as abruptly as the acnes on a teenager's face. It was simple but there were too much things to consider. How can John, a single man living alone,be deemed as better for the job of taking care of a kid than ,said , a couple consisting of two people. Not to mention taking care of a child means making sacrifices. What if the boy grows to resent him. 

After a while lingering at that thought, John's mind decided to advance the ante and had him wondering about the boy's origin. 

' He has only mentioned his mother and not his father. Maybe he is absent. If so where and who can he be? '

A speculation popped into his mind but John quickly swatted it away like one would normally do to a fly, quick and forceful. It was silly and blatantly ridiculous to even consider that idea as no way would someone as married to his work as Sherlock would ever have had the desire to do it. Even if he had, not like Sherlock would be heartless enough to do something like this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, ? 

' No , he wouldn't. Sure the wanker had his own shortcomings and "" high-functioning sociopath "" status but he wouldn't be cruel enough to.. ' the thought was cut short by the smell of the dish being done. 

' Dear god, I am going insane '

Turning off the stove, John divided the dish onto two plates. If  in the near future his most terrible and abhorrent speculation is proven to be true , then John really needs to reevaluate how good he is at choosing candidates on whom he places his trust. But that was another matter for another day, right now his only concern was to make sure his little guest feel welcome. 

"" Food's ready, lad. - John said as he set the two plates on the table , before realizing he had forgotten to retrieve the utensils and turning to Arthur- Could you be so kind as to grab the utensils near the sink, Arthur "" 

To which, the boy quickly obliged, running to the sink to get the utensils and returning back to the table before giving them to John who organized them beside each plate of pasta. 

"" Well dig in, Arthur. ""

The rest of the dinner was a bit weird to John, mainly because he hadn't eaten with someone for months now, so he was a bit unsure about how he looked while eating, though he soon realized he didn't have to worry much as his company was only a kid, so no need for any too proper table manner. 

"" It's delicious, Mr John. You're a really good cook "" Said Arthur, who was devouring the pasta with much vigor. Kid ate like he hadn't eaten for days. Chuckling lightly, John pulled out a tissue to wipe the sauce that got on the boy's face. Despite the initial flinch, Arthur let him. 

"" Thanks ,Arthur ""

Despite thinking it was just an attempt to break the awkward silence, John accepted the compliment nonetheless. It's not everyday that he gets a compliment, given how plain he seems. After all, it was Sherlock who got all the attention  with his good looks, brilliant mind and equally dickish personality. Plus,it was good that Arthur was willing to talk and possibly open up more to him. In order to help the kid , he needed more information on him. 

 

After dinner and the washing up of dishes and kitchenware ( with the help of Arthur, who insisted that he help, despite John's numerous assurance that he could handle it himself) . After a minute of discussing, John gave in to the boy's insistence, deciding that this was probably his way of showing thanks. John admitted that it was endearing. 

After that, it was already 9:30 pm, which was a bit too early for him to hit the hay but he was too tired to wait another hour and Arthur, being a kid, probably needed his sleep by now, seeing how he had been yawning and rubbing his eyes for the past 10 minutes while holding his bags. 

"" Well I guess it's time to go to the bed "" John said to Arthur, who was halfway to dozing off while standing, jerk up. 

"" O-okay "" Arthur half-said, half-yawned, and started to walk towards the sofa, settling one of his bags down, before proceeding to hop on the sofa, using the other softer bag as a makeshift pillow. 

He was halfway to lying down on his back when John said 

"" What are you doing, lad? You're not sleeping here "", which seemed to startle him enough for him to sit up 

"" O-oh - his eyes looked down at the cold, hard floor - then am I going to sleep on the floor? "", his tone a bit sad but no trace of surprise could be found. It's not like he couldn't get a few shut-eyes sleeping on the floor, he had had worse. 

"" W-what- John quickly retorted to clear the misunderstanding , he looked disturbed at how Arthur came to the conclusion that just because he was told that he wasn't sleeping the sofa,he would be sleeping on the floor - You're not sleeping on the floor. J-just follow me""

Holding Arthur's small hand, John guided him to the bedroom upstairs, his bedroom. 

"" You will be sleeping here for the time being, lad. So get comfortable "" said John before walking to the closet to pull out a pillow and a spare sheet. 

"" Well you best go to bed now. The bathroom is downstairs and if you need anything, I will be downstairs too. "" With that John was out of the room. 

Staring at the decently furnished bedroom, so different from the thin dirty mattress at home that had been his ""bed"" ever since he could remember. Reaching towards the bed, he could feel the soft, bouncy material beneath his palm. 

' It feels nice and comfortable ' 

Sitting on the bed, he could feel how bouncy it was, unlike the deflated one back home. There was also no foul smell or discoloration that could make him rather sleep on the floor. Letting his body lay down on the bed complete, Arthur felt like he was dreaming , that any seconds he was going to wake up and be back at home, smelling the putrid smell of vomit, sexual intercourse and alcohol and hearing all the grotesque noise and the sight of the white mind-destroying powder and colourful pills. 

Grabbing his wrist, he pinched it hard in an attempt to "" wake up"". It had been nice, but if he were to stay in his dreamland any longer, he might end up crying for something that isn't even real when he wakes up. 

' Maybe the pain isn't enough ' thought Arthur as he bought the back of his right palm up to his mouth and bit down hard , enough to leave a slight mark but not enough for blood to leak out

Letting go and wincing at the pain, he saw that nothing had changed. He was still in a bedroom with a comfy bed and he was safe, at least for the next few days. 

' So it's real and not my wild imagination '. Lying back down on the bed, he succumbed to the softness of the material and dozed off to dreamland. 

Meanwhile, John was downstairs, pondering what kind of hellish life did Arthur go through. Remembering his expression when he had thought that he would be taking up residence on the hard and cold floor of the flat just made John want to punch the kid's parents even more. Who would even do that to a child? A monster that's for sure. 


She used to care about me but not anymore. All about her boyfriend and "" Happy pills""


'Drugs' concluded John, letting a sigh of exasperation. Oh how he despised this side of humanity. 

As a doctor, he had heard about many stories involving drug addictions of all kinds such as heroine, morphine, acid, hallucinogen, etc,.. within the medical community, but none of that compared to seeing the damage it caused for the innocent with your own eyes. Drugs, the illegal and extremely dangerous kind, can turn a kind human into a raging savage who would do anything to get their next hit to the point that that is all they care about, ignoring everyone else, even one's own children.Coming from a not so happy home life himself, John could sympathize with Arthur. The boy was strong and bright but abuse and neglect like that can affect anyone, especially children whose mind hasn't matured and so can be easily led astray. Children who grow up with drug addicted parents are said by researchers to have a high risk of committing substance abuse when older. The thought of the cycle being repeated in the future sickened John so he decided he was going to deal with that tomorrow. Right now, sleep was what he needed. 

 

 

 

Hello there, sorry for not uploading, schools in my country just started again so I am going to be a tad busy for next coming month. Apologies beforehand for the slow updates. I will make it up in length, hopefully

As the light of the sun shone through the uncovered window, Arthur groaned and rolled over. Instead of the short transition from the mattress to the floor like he had anticipated , he received a rather pain-inducing fall. 

"" Ouch what the hell ?"" He grunted, rubbing his side to ease the throbbing. At least that wasn't the only one he had. It took him a moment to clear his foggy mind and register that he wasn't at his home. 

"" Oh yeah"" He muttered, rubbing his head as he recalled the events of yesterday. To be honest, it was still a bit shocking for him that his mother would abandon him. As much as he hated his mother now, it was hard to deny that a long time ago, there had existed feelings for his mother ,other than hatred and resentment. Standing up, he reached for his bags, joyful to find that nothing was lost. Reaching into his knitted cardigan, he let out a sigh of relief that his pocket knife was still in place. 

' I wonder who thought of the idea for pocket knife. Did that person just one day think "" Hey, I want a knife that can fold into itself so that I can surprise my enemies. You think this is a piece of wood, bam a knife."" Maybe I will look into that later '

' People may think I am a deranged psycho for carrying around a knife but better have some protection than none, right? Especially in my situation ' thought Arthur as he settled the knife back into one of the pockets on the inside of his cardigan. which all seemed to be of a different material than the rest of his cardigan. They were worn pieces of scrap fabric cut and neatly sewn onto the cardigan for better holding ability , they even had  buttons used to close the pockets to ensure further that none of the contents slipped out.

' Good thing I know how to sew. I will have to admit I really outdid myself on these , thought I did pricked my fingers a great many times ' he smiled at the result of his meticulous and patient sewing while shuddering a bit from memories of the sharp pain experienced when sewing, feeling a sense of pride and like he was one step closer to proving Mother that he wasn't useless. 


 But what if you are??  


Honestly he thought it was weird how people were so adversed to carrying knives as self-defense weapon. I mean would be inconvenient for someone to accuse you of being a murderer just because you were carrying a knife. He hoped the officers wouldn't that gullible. But then again he had managed to sneak through a bunch of official police officers, all with badges and other authoritarian stuff, to get into a murder scene. Even Mr Policeman there - what was his name again - L-lestrade, yeah, even Mr Lestrade, a likely trained professional that had been working the job for years, indicated by his age ,posture and general familiarity with gore, had looked like he had just seen a ghost. Reminded of the event, Arthur couldn't help be feel proud for having been able to fool several police officers. 

Realizing that it was still early in the morning, Arthur decided to look around the room. 

' Dog tags, polished frequently, probably hold some sentimental value , so Mr John was in the military. No wonder he always walks like the soldiers in military documents' 

The though frightened Arthur a bit. Now knowing that he was in the same house with an ex-military, he needed to come up with a different strategy to fight back and escape if need be. No one knew Arthur had a knife on him so maybe he could aim at a vital organ or maybe go for the legs and slice the tendons. Humans can be so fragile if you know where to inflict damage

He knew that his thinking of ways to kill anyone that came close to him was a bit ridiculous and if not all but demented, deranged, psychotic and insane from a sane person's view.Not like he was in any potential danger, even if Mr John had wanted to hurt him, he would have done it in his sleep. And what use would he make of killing a child, especially when said child had been reported to the police about his abandonment. If Arthur were killed, his murderer wouldn't get off scot free easily. 

' Still it can't hurt to be careful ' the voice inside his head illustrated. The voice was annoying at times but it had saved his arse more than once so he didn't have much complaint about his anxiety for now. 

After all, Arthur essentially had no one to lean on. If he is going to be put into foster care, which is muchly likely, adoption, on the other hand, not so much, as few would want a child his age, too rebellious and stubborn, then he will run the risk of being used a tool for good population, a trophy that his "" caretakers"" flaunt to prove to the world how they are good-hearted beings to have the courage to take in a deranged child. 

Unfortunately, seeing how disappointing human kind can be, the public will, most likely, eat up those lies like a pack of hungry wolves spotting a juicy piece of meat. 

' Mr John has an a large amount of jumpers. He must love wearing them' Arthur commented as he spotted the arrangement of neatly folded jumpers in the closet. 

' I can't argue with that. Jumpers are comfortable and cozy, they are like hugs personified as clothes. I wish I had one '

Awakening from his restless slumber, John stretched his arms over his head and arched his back. Sleeping on the couch wasn't exactly comfortable but he still managed to get some rest, despite the minor nightmares. John was surprised that he hadn't waken up screaming like a madman during the night, which would be very awkward for him and Arthur. 

' I wonder how he is doing ' John thought as he slipped out of the sofa and walked upstairs. 

Opening the door to his bedroom, expecting to see the blond boy still sound asleep, to his surprise, Arthur wasn't asleep, in fact, he wasn't seen anywhere within John's vision. 


oh fuck


""Where the fuck is he? "" The doctor muttered, turning his head in all directions in search of the blond-headed boy, any signs of the head of curly blond locks. 

Scrambling around, lifting up the bed sheets and  pillows, opening up the closet and looking under the bed, John basically checked every nook and cranny for the boy. 

' oh bloody hellish fucking tossing shit of the motherfucking Lord of the damn above ' Cursing out every kind of profanity John had learnt during his army time, he realized that Arthur wasn't even in the room. Rushing out of the room, John was just, quite frankly, moment away from turning the flat upside down. 

' HOW THE FUCK DID I MANAGE TO LOSE A KID ?' 

Fortunately for him and quite possibly the flat , the sight of the blond curly hair came into view. 

' Oh thank god ' John let out a sigh of utter and utmost relief. That was like the second near heart attack he had had in the last 24 hours, and they were all caused by the same individual. What an accomplishment!! 

After the relief, John noticed someone was standing in front of Arthur. 

It was Mr Hudson, who frankly looked puzzled as to why there was a small child here in John's flat.

' Knew I would have to explain sooner or later ' 

Pinching the bridge of his nose, John approached to resolve the awkward and puzzling situation that was definitely causing both parties to feel very confused, although on Arthur's part it was more uncomfortable and uncertain. 

"" Hi Mrs Hudson "" John started, showing a smile to increase the chance of this going smoothly

"" I can explain "" he continued , pulling Mr Hudson aside to have a chat with her while telling Arthur to go freshen up in the loo and that he could find a spare toothbrush in a bag hanged on the door. 

After explaining Mrs Hudson the reason why Arthur was staying with him for a few days at least until they could locate any of his relatives.  He only talked about the accidentally solved a case vaguely as he didn't want another one making the comparison between Arthur and Sherlock.(*cough cough* Lestrade)His slowly going mad brain had already been doing a wonderful and fantastic job at that. 

' Honestly the kid's looks are similar enough, had not been for his hair and some facial features . Maybe I do need to go the loony house.'

"" Poor boy "" Mrs Hudson said, eyeing Arthur who was sitting on the couch, reading one of John's medical books. He was probably too absorbed by the book to notice the worried stare of Mrs Hudson, which was good. 

John only nodded in agreement with Mrs Hudson. 

I am back, my lovelies. Thank you so much for supporting me through the story. I appreciate it, hope you enjoy the rest of the story as well if not more than what has already been posted.

After having explained the situation of Arthur to Mrs Hudson, John might as well get the two acquainted. It might help ease the discomfort now being made by Arthur's relentless and unblinking staring, like that of a doctor preparing to perform a surgery or a pathologist doing an autopsy. 

"" Well Arthur- John started, pulling the two face to face, well more like face to chest or collar since Arthur's height was still that of a child- this is Mrs Hudson, the landlady- Mrs Hudson glanced at John- also not the housekeeper. Mrs Hudson, this is Arthur, the one who will be staying with me here for a few days. ""

Looking down at the small boy, Mrs Hudson flashed a friendly motherly smile

"" Oh aren't you just absolutely precious, dear boy "" She said, cupping Arthur's two cheeks still full with baby fat, thus making them extremely impossible not to pinch or in Mrs Hudson's case, squish. 

' Soft like marshmallow'

"" Nice to meet you too, Mrs Hudson""  Arthur replied, struggling to get his words out due Mrs Hudson's hold on part of his face. He still wasn't used to people being .............................................. kind to him. Being touched normally meant incoming hits to the body part being touched. 

The egg donor had suck awful taste in boyfriends. 

'Perhaps Father or maybe I should call him sperm donor, after all I have never met him and possibly never will, is even worse. God knows if he is even alive and has not, by some miracle, overdosed or landed himself in prison. '

The thought amused Arthur and he felt a bit too ecstatic for imagining his biological life giver's suffering. 


What if he is doing well and doesn't even know you exist ? 


That really got on Arthur's nerves, leaving his hands tighten into fists and his teeth grinding like he was chewing through a newly mauled prey . The thought of being essentially forgotten, it is even worse than being a mistake who only existed due to two people being horny and didn't think thing through, and also drugs. The idea that the fucking sperm donor was out there living life, hell, what if the fucker already had a family, partner and kids and all of that shit. If Arthur were to show up saying"" Hi, I am the accident that came from your one night stand with your fellow drug addict when you were high off your bloody mind "", the results wouldn't be good, not in the very least. 

' Can the word really be "" forgotten "" when your existence means nothing to them ? ' thought Arthur, that was another thing to add to the list "" Reasons why I may have parental issues""

Snapping back from his mind, he heard 

"" And you're so thin, we need to fatten you, boy. Put some meat on your bones"" Mr Hudson said, eyeing Arthur's appearance and deeming him to be in need of some good nourishment. That made Arthur look down at himself. His choice of clothes was off, but what could you do when you hardly had any clothes to alter between? And he was a bit on the thin side, though not enough to make his ribs poke out but it was still a bit concerning. 

It's not like he was picky about food, it's just that he couldn't stomach the nearly spoiled mush at home. 

' Poor boy needs to be fed ' Mrs Hudson thought and decided that she was going to bake him some goodies to fatten him up. 

"" As a matter of fact, Mrs H. I was just going to make breakfast for us. Would you like to join? "" John offered , already on his way to the fridge to get the ingredients. 

"" That's a delightful offer, John but I can't. "" Mrs Hudson politely declined. "" Still got some work to take care of. I only came here cause you have been so quiet yesterday. I thought-"" She closed her mouth before finishing her sentence 

John knew what she was going to say, he couldn't blame her for worrying too much. One of her boys had already died, so she couldn't afford another tragedy to happen. 

Saying a farewell, Mrs Hudson went off to continue her business, leaving only the two blonds in the flat. 

""Come on Arthur, let's go make some breakfast "" 

"" C-can I help, Mr John? "" 

"" Of course, lad""

After having breakfast (bacon,eggs, buttered toast and caramelized veggies), both of them sat on the couch , both trying to get used to the other's presence.

Arthur was feeling a bit uncomfortable, he never had breakfast often.

The conversation Mrs Hudson and John had had earlier had piqued Arthur's interest. Despite the lack of social skills, he could tell that the topic they were discussing was a bit on the sensitive side, due to the fact they intentionally lowered their volume so that he couldn't hear. He knew that he shouldn't get nosey but curiosity eventually got the best of him. After all he needed to better this new environment to avoid risking any provoking the people around here. 

' Now I think about it, I haven't seen Mr John's flatmate anywhere. And he looks like he slept on the couch yesterday ( indent on the couch, and the pillow and blanket on it confirm it). Why didn't he choose to stay in the other bedroom? Maybe he and his flatmate aren't close. '

Glancing at the furnishing of the living room, all the books, decorations, especially the skull that sat on the fireplace. It looked real and Arthur had to resist the urge to go and touch it to confirm his suspicion. 

' Impossible, the mingling of the furniture proves otherwise. Normally, people won't let their possession comes into contact with those of someone they don't trust. Insecurity, fear of thievery and being taken advantage of and the like. Then again the door to the bedroom is locked so maybe Mr John can't get in, even if he wants to. '

Recollection of the glimpse he got into he bedroom flashed before his eyes. 

'WRONG,  disastrously wrong. 'His mind shouted

' The inside was dusty.Even in the darkness, I could make out some of the dust on the floor and the other side of the door. So that bedroom haven't been used from some time now. What happened to his flatmate? They didn't move out that's for sure, the furniture and personal belongings were still there, in the bedroom. '

If you hasn't before then you maybe thinking that Arthur was peculiar and too aware for a kid. 

Due the lack of social interaction and loneliness, Arthur had developed this habit of keeping himself busy. Sometimes it was reading the books that hadn't been sold off with the intention of fueling mother's addiction, sometimes it was researching things off the Net in the local library, sometimes it was just going to the nearby park,  and see if anyone had left anything behind. Sometimes he would do that at school. ( he actually got his knitted cardigan that way and also a couple of jackets lying in his bags).

He never got caught, which was good. 

' Maybe the flatmate is dead ' the idea popped up in his head. 

' It's logical, and would like explain the aura Mr John is giving off, like someone who is in mourning'

Quickly enough, it was time for John to go to work. Seeing Arthur who had been sitting silently on the couch for a little too long, with his hands slightly raised and his finger tips touching each other, John decided to take one of his books off the shelves. The book was "" The hobbit"" , one of John's personal favourites

' I hope the kid likes this one, he seems to like reading ' 

"" Arthur, i'm going to go to work. Stay here and behave, okay lad? ""

Arthur nodded

"" Oh and here's a book to keep ya company. If you finish it early, you can grab another on the shelves . If you grow hungry, food is in the fridge. The telly remote is over there. OH and your clothes, I don't think I have any your size-""

"" I have a few in my bags, Mr John. ""

"" O-okay, well bye""

"" Goodbye Mr John, thank you for the book""

After John left, Arthur looked down at the book

""The hobbit"" He muttered 

"" Seems interesting "" And started to open the first page. 

On John's part ,  the work was as usual. The common cold, sprained ankle, sore throat, the like. The work was boring but fulfilling in a way, knowing he was doing some good curing the ill.After examining one of his patients,

' Stomach indigestion, typical '

John sat down at his table and lean back to get some rest.

Feeling his phone ring, he pulled it out. It was a text from Lestrade. 

It read:"" Bring the kid to the Yard at 3pm today. We need to do a DNA test "" 

"" Weird how they have already got a possible candidate "" John said under his breath. 

From what he knew, this type of cases usually didn't end with a relative being located. Being put into foster care was the normal outcome for case like this. 

Standing up , John headed to see Sarah his boss, to ask for an early leave. When she asked for the reason, John explained the situation vaguely, only telling the outline of thing, leaving out the fact said child in his care accidentally solved a case. 

Being kind and understanding, Sarah allowed him to leave early by two hours. John thought part of it was because they were low on patients today so what's the harm in allowing John to leave early to do some good. 

 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

As for Arthur, he was  back at the flat, nose deep in the book, reading each word with much vigor. 

It was more interesting than he expected, although he wished there had been more elaboration on the characters but this was a children book. 

Finally finishing the book after three hours of continuously reading, minus the time he had to close it temporarily to digest the knowledge that was dropped on him like a bomb. 

"" I kinda like this Bilbo fellow "" He muttered, a bit sad that the story had to end but then again, what didn't? 

After finishing the book John had given him, Arthur was, with all honesty, bored. Usually he didn't have any free time like this. He wondered if he asked nicely, could he go outside to gather some plants to observe. Back at home, there was a poison ivy bush growing near his house, he would pick some leaves( using a piece of paper as a barrier between his hand and the itch-inducing leaves) and make potion out of them, mostly just boiling them in an attempt to extract the substance inside that caused the itching and rashes

It had been silly but he had been only 8 or 9 at the time so his knowledge on chemistry had been rudimentary.He wondered if he had left them to dry out, would them still be as effective. If they were then it would be hard to distinguish them once mixed into dried tea leaves.

' That's a neat little idea' he thought, wondering if poison ivy would be strong enough to kill a person if enough was used 

There had also been mushrooms growing from the floor of his house. He knew it was due to the unhygienic circumstances, but they were still interesting to him nonetheless. 

He would pick them up, clean them, smell them, cut them open to observe the squishy inside, tries to see if he could grow more by planting one into the soil of the nearby park. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. 

It had been unclear to him whether they were poisonous or not. He had been tempted to pop one into his mouth. 

' If it's not, I will have something to eat, if it is, then I can escape this hellhole' was what he had thought at the time. To him, it was basically a win-win situation. And so down the mushroom went to his stomach. 

Fortunately ( for us of course ) , he only had a nasty urge to regurgitate, and he did. 

"" Maybe I should have put them into mother's food "" He said subconsciously while placing the book back on the shelf, considering the action seriously

  He decided it was best to move on to something else. No use thinking about the past

His mind wandered to the thought of all his new academic books for his year 7 in his bags, which were  gifted to him by the school since he was among the list of students living in poverty.

' Honestly we wouldn't be so bad off if she actually had some brain cells in her drug filled skull'

' Maybe I should get a head start in studying but it's so tedious sometimes. All the bloody formulas of mathematics. '

Despite being very capable of remembering those pesky formulas, he still groaned at the thought of doing things that were, in his opinion, not his cup of tea. He was more interested in human anatomy, biology, chemistry, medicine and lastly history than mathematics. 

He knew that mathematics is the very thing that helps human advance to this point of almost having mind-numbing conveniences. He knew the basics and everything required to work out everyday problems, how weird phenomenons can be explained with science and basic logic. 

"" Well that's enough over thinking for a day "" Arthur said, jumping off the couch and walked off to find something to do.

Back to John, he still had an hour left till he could leave, which was 1pm . Now was 12am , he still had about one or two patients left so it wasn't too hard. 

' Maybe i should seek out other place to work' he thought since this had become quite boring and mundane for him. 

' God that bastard rubbed off on me ' he thought, wondering how the dead could have such an impact on the living for being...........well dead. 

After all patients had been examined and diagnosed, he bid his colleagues and his boss good bye and gathered his things. 

On his way, he kept thinking of how he could get Arthur to share more of his home life prior to being abandoned. 

' He seems to be unaware of how devastating this kind of treatment is' John thought , remembering the tone Arthur had used when talking about his mother. It was cold, without any warmth, like when talking to a stranger. 

' Children coming from abusive or neglectful household generally don't grasp the full extent of their mistreatment, especially those who have endured this since young '

At least that was he knew about the subject. 

There were cases of the abused growing to become abusers themselves. It's ironic , in John's opinion, to become the one you once hated with every fiber of your being. In worse cases, they can have a complete breakdown, breaking their fragile psyche permanently

It's understandable that emotions can be unpredictable, it's the thing that can make us or break us. Emotions give us motivation to do things, but they can make us feel so crushed to the point of losing ourselves and grip on reality. 

John once heard a story from one of his military friends. When she ( the friend) was a teenager, a string of murder started happening in the neighborhood. The killer targeted women with blond hair, blue eyes, basically girls that were considered attractive. The bodies were mutilated, their skin ripped off their face, their vaginas stabbed with a, what the police assumed, kitchen knife,their breasts cut clean off and laid beside their bloody cadavers.

Turned out the killer was a girl, who was always shamed by her mother and father for not being "" perfect "", at school she was ridiculed for being one of the ugly ones. Due to this, the first time someone showed affection for her, she leeched on like a leech. Unfortunately for her, the guy only took advantage of her and then left. 

All of this broke her and she started to have the illusion that she could kill these "" perfect girls"" and get their most best assets, which were faces and breasts. She only left the breasts behind because they weren't good enough, in her broken mind. 

When the police caught her, she killed herself. 

The case was sad in John's opinion. It just made him feel both sorry and not sorry for the killer. Though he still leaned towards the idea that she should have been responsible for her horrible actions, a thought still lingered in his head 

What if they had gotten the girl help? 

What if she hadn't gone through all the mistreatment? 

So on and so forth, but it was quite useless to worry about the past now

And yet you're still hung up on him .His annoying mind taunted him. 

He quickly swatted that  input away, locking it in a chamber with lots of locks and chains in his mind dedicated to unwanted things, where it sat alongside some of his war memories and other complicated feelings and thoughts that couldn't be said. The chamber always had whispers and screams emitting from it but John could brush them away easily enough


"" First time? "" The other emotions and thoughts that John had previously locked away greeted the newcomer


 

 

Arriving at Baker Street, John walked up the stairs leading to his flat. He hoped Arthur didn't get bored being in the flat all day. 

Opening the door, John could still see the hallucination of Sherlock, just standing there in all his glory, trench coat, suit, scarf and all, staring through his very soul. He had been having these for a few months now. At the beginning, he would find himself waking up, carrying out an entire conversation with fake Sherlock, nearly forgetting about the suicide, until reality kicked in and Sherlock would vanish, leaving John behind questioning his sanity. Mycroft had revealed his supposed "" concern "" about John's condition. John wondered why the governmental official even bothered with him. His brother was dead, John had no uses anymore. Why choose to keep helping him? John would never understand that.

He even threatened to admit John into a mental asylum, which wasn't something that John took to. 

He was already considered pathetic enough, in his view, he didn't need another reason to hate himself. To please the ginger demon and possibly get some peace, John had decided to ignore all his hallucinations. Sometimes it worked with fake Sherlock slowly fading away, sometimes he broke down crying, mumbling incoherent noises and reaching for something sharp. 

Watching the vision slowly fade into nothing, like many times before, he called out for Arthur

"" Arthur, I am home. Where are you? ""

Sure enough, a head of blond locks immediately came into view

"" Ah, I see you have freshened up, lad ""

Arthur was now wearing a pair of dark grey trousers, a cream coloured wrinkled shirt. On the sofa, he could see the clothes Arthur had worn yesterday. Walking over to the sofa, John carefully picked up the pile of clothes, Hearing Arthur audible gasp and the hesitation to let him come in contact with the clothes, John said :

"" No worry, lad. I am just going to put them in the laundry basket for a wash"" 

Arthur maneuvered his raised hand down, feeling a bit red in the cheeks for having reacted so rashly, despite the fact John didn't seem to mind.

"" Well good news, Arthur. Lestrade managed to locate a possible relative of yours."" John said, taking off his beige overcoat to hang on the coat hanger. 

"" Though it is weird that you will need to do a DNA exam "" He continued 

"" Well mother never was close to any of her family members "" Arthur said, remembering all the time mother would drunkenly reveal a lot of her issues to him during her high, with profanity , sex, trauma and all. 

"" I won't be surprised if they try to deny my existence. ""

"" o-okay "" John let out, not knowing whether he should proceed with the conversation. In the end, he decided to push forward with it

"" Anyway, you are always about your mother. Mind if you tell me more about your father? "" John said gently

"" You don't have to, if you don't want to, Arthur "" He added, seeing Arthur's hesitant expression. 

"" No I want to "" He replied, after a minute of contemplating. 

"" Well - he started, a bit nervous, he had never had to to talk about father , he didn't even know what he looked like - I don't know much about father, he has never been in the picture. ""

Well, John's speculation was confirmed. 

"" I only know that he was mother's one-night-stand or one-night-fuck ""

John was a little surprised at how Arthur knew that word, okay maybe not much considering the kid's home life but it was still startling to hear that word coming from a kid. Maybe it was not that fact that he knew the word rather than how he discovered the meaning and the situation in which he learnt it. 

"" Whenever she was drunk or high or well both,- the images of numerous beer bottles and pill containers flashed before John's eyes, he wondered if this imaginary imagery of his was any close to the real one - she would cry and lament and blame everything in existence, blaming father, blaming me, despite the fact that I am sure that part of it was because of her horny arse "" The last one was said in a mutter but John still caught it. 

"" Sometimes she would force me to listen to her lamenting about how her passionate night with father was, how she should have used me to pin it again him and force him into marriage. She said he came from a rich background. 

Fortunately for the sperm donor, she never found him ""

Finishing his story , Arthur added a flick of both his hands, as if this was just a normal topic to come up in conversations. John 

John opened his mouth to speak but closed it again , rethinking his question again. Finally he said 

"" So, do you have any idea what he looks like? "" 

"" It would help with our investigation "" He added quickly. 

Arthur seemed to believe it

"" Well, Mr John, I only know what mother described to me. If I remember correctly and mother wasn't deliriously making things up, he has black hair ( though I doubt that will narrow anything), is tall and lean. But that could be anyone. "" He said, trying not to remember all the graphic depiction mother provided about his lower region. 

"" And what about demeanour? "" John asked subconsciously, honestly he didn't even know why he would be asking such a question. 

"" Oh mother never mentioned it, that's how she is, always saying how much of a bloody looker he was and how she should have trapped him to the old balls and chains. Though I do remember one time she said that he wasn't such a gentleman, but he made up in - Arthur shuddered at the exact words of his mother - other ways "" He said, hoping that John would get the meaning without him having to outright say it. 

And he did, indicated by his wide eyes and slight redding on the face

Can't believe I am already on chapter 11.Hope you all like the development of Arthur's character.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Looking at the time, John saw it was time for them to get going , can't keep Lestrade waiting. Putting on his overcoat again, he helped Arthur put on his cardigan ( it was cold out today despite being summer,and John's doctor instinct wasn't having a kid go out without any things to keep him warm). John didn't have any spare scarf for Arthur so he took a deep breathe and walked to his bedroom to grab a dark blue scarf that once had been in the possession of the world's only consulting detective. After his death, John had taken the scarf to his room. There were times he would cry into it until he fell asleep, times he would wrap it around his neck, pulling a tad too tight and contemplate whether he should do it. 

The option was so tempting. But he hadn't gone through with it ( lucky us), only because of his stupidly stubborn belief that Sherlock was alive. Another thing to keep him going is to see the day when Sherlock's name was cleared and he was in fact innocent.

Walking back downstairs, John pulled the scarf around Arthur's neck, wrapping it neatly and snuggly around the young child. 

And off they went to New Scotland Yard, catching a cab and instructing the driver about the location. 

Arriving at the Yard, they hopped out and came in the building. 

The place wasn't particularly crowded that day and most, if not all of the officers, didn't exactly bat an eye at the two blonds, few would give a quick glance, the more unsavoury ones would openly snarl, knowing how John had worked together with Sherlock on many cases. 

"" Hey it's the Freak's little dog again, look like he has got a mini Freak with him? "" One of the annoying officers whispered to his other colleagues, who all giggled, not knowing that John had heard every single bit of it. They only mentioned the mini Freak part because of the fact Arthur was with John, not because of his appearance. Those fuckers weren't able to get a good look at him, partly for the long scarf covering a portion of his face. But the single fact that he was with John was enough for their fat, greasy, donut-eating mouths to start moving. 

Glancing at the group of officers shit talking, he could see among the members there were Donovan and Anderson. 

' Go figures'

' Calm calm, peace and damn gutting quiet, just calm down John, you can do it. You're better than these fucking tossers' John reassured himself while simultaneously swearing in all the languages that he was fluent in, which was surprisingly lots for someone deemed as so painfully average and forgettable. 

' Honestly how did they even get this job? Those wankers!! Bloody fannies '

John was starting to understand why Sherlock had always complained of the Yard being filled with"" idiots with less intelligence than a primitive amoeba "" . He hoped that Arthur hadn't heard any of that. 

They quickly their way to Lestrade's office. 

They met Lestrade at his office, who was actually looking better than yesterday, he no longer had the crow nest of a head and bloodshot eyes. 

'Well he doesn't look like total shit anymore ' thought the two blonds. 

He guided they to where Arthur would take the DNA exam

"" Where's the candidate? "" John asked, seeing that there was no one in sight beside them and another person who would be taking Arthur's blood sample to send for examination. 

"" Oh- he is busy, he has already given us his blood sample. "" Lestrade answered, scratching his head. 

' he? ' John thought

"" Who is this guy supposed to be in relation with Arthur? "" He asked. 

"" Well he is speculated as his uncle but it needs to be confirmed "" Lestrade quickly replied, almost as if he had expected John to ask

"" And what can he do for Arthur's situation ? "" John pressed forward, honestly not trusting this supposed uncle, especially if the wanker couldn't even come here and see his nephew's face for himself. 

"" Well-well, we're looking into it "" 

And no other additional answers were provided for the rest of the procedure. No matter how he asked, Lestrade would just clam up, saying that they were still looking into it. 

After the procedure was done, they were informed that the result would come in after a few days, so in the meantime it was decided that Arthur would keep staying with John. 

""So do you wanna to go anywhere, lad? It's still quite early "" John asked, looking at his watch and realising that it was only about 5pm.

Looking up in the sky, Arthur thought for a moment. 

"" Can we go to the park, Mr John? "" 

"" Of course""

Arriving at the park, John sat down on a nearby bench while Arthur went around , taking in the view. He had never been to this park before. It was greener than the one he had gone to. 

Meanwhile John looked around the park. It had been a while since he had been out this much. Truth to be told, he had been burying himself in work and in his extensive  mourning to even find the energy  and motivation  to go out. His mind began to wonder what would happen when the DNA result came. 

He didn't trust this supposed uncle of Arthur at all. I mean who would even not bother seeing the face of unknown close relative. Not to mention that Arthur had said that he didn't know any family members besides his mother. 

' Surely this can't be one of those human traffickers. One can't simply be that stupid. It's like be willing to get caught by the police ' John thought, glancing at the small frame of Arthur, making sure he hadn't gone so far. The young boy was poking at the ground with a stick he had found nearby. 

' And if the guy really is Arthur's uncle then can he really help him? What if his whole family is fucked up? What if his family doesn't accept him?' 

Ah yes the caretaker's instinct was kicking in yet again. 

Standing up, John started walking towards where he last saw Arthur with the intention of checking up on the boy, after all he hadn't seen a sight of the blond head for the last 25 minutes now and he was beginning to feel anxious. 

Turning around the trees with their uneven branches and overgrown roots , he searched for any signs of the boy, occasionally yelling his name in hope of catching his attention. To everyone else, he probably seemed like a dad looking for his overactive son that managed to slip out of his sight when he had least expected it. 

If you paid attention, you might even see some parents nearby chuckling sympathetically , with the "" Yeah we all have been there"" look on their faces. 

John, however, was too focused on the task at hand to notice it. 

Arriving at the less populated area of the park, John finally found Arthur leaning against the trunk of a large tree. 

""Arthur, there you- John stopped when he registered the soft whimpering, bruises and scratches on the boy's face. His cardigan had been made worse by the appearance of some brown spots, most likely caused by dirty, other than that he seemed alright. 

He quickly got closer, worried that Arthur was hurt. Crouching down to Arthur's level, he slowly reached for his face, cupping it gently before slightly raising it up for easy examination. 

' Face slightly bruised and scratched, still some evidence of dirt, probably from face colliding with the ground. Dirt got in eyes. Slight dirt and leaves in hair'

Next to check were his arms and legs. Trailing his eyes downward, John noticed a little bump rising up from the midsection of Arthur's cardigan. It was moving, wiggling upwards. 

A yelp startled John and out popped a little kitten, full black with the only exceptions being a third of its face, on the right , being orange and its front paws being white(as least from what John could see since it lower half was still nested in Arthur's cardigan)making it look like the creature was wearing tiny socks. Upon closer examination, he noticed the small feline was bleeding a little from its left front leg. 

' So the whimpering was from the cat ? ' thought John, a bit relieved that it wasn't Arthur  

Reaching for the cat, John was caught off guard when his wrist was soon held in place by Arthur's hand. 

""Don't-don't hurt i-it, please"" He pleaded, in his eyes John's image was beginning to fade out and be replaced by that of someone less merciful of small unexpected creatures appearing in front of them. 

"" P-please, just d-don't "" He repeated

 

 

Writing this has made me realize how fucking wild my imagination is .You may realize this by now but I just love having the characters' thought process and inner turmoil be heard. The narrative is a mirror, reflecting the characters' inner thoughts.I hope this doesn't get on your nerves.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          






Mother was never kind to him these days or ever. 



"" What the hell do you have there, brat? "" She spat out venomously, almost like one would to a convicted felon, eyes once intelligent now were nothing but dimwitted 



"" A dog"" Arthur replied, managing not to choke on his own words. He had only wanted to help the poor canine. Eyes widened in anger and reddened from all the drugs and alcohol, the woman yanked the dog out of Arthur's clutches, still yelping and weeping in pain, and threw it out of the door. The poor dog landed a bit harshly but was lucky to still be able to run away, albeit with a noticeable limp



' No broken bones ' noted Arthur, glad that at least the dog would live another day, in peace at least. Unlike Arthur, who was about to face yet another onslaught by the hands of the being that was supposed to care for him. 



"" You listen you fucking dirt face, we already have a pest in this house- she said, pointing her long fake nails accusingly at Arthur, almost making contact with his face, especially the freckles he was quote-unquote "" cursed"" with, and then pulled away a mere second later like he was evil reincarnated



'Narrow-minded fanny.Don't even know that freckles are a natural occurrence, not some bloody voodoo magic of the damned ' 



' Well, maybe you shouldn't have been such a cock sucker and should actually have taken birth control. And better yet, not have sex when high as a damn kite on a windy day. But no you had to get your bloody cunt filled with bloody fucking sperm, eh? ' was what Arthur wanted to retaliate with but he knew better. He had to keep the facade of being oblivious lest he get beatened and starved, more often that is. It's great he didn't stand out so much and could easily blend in the background when needed. 



' Probably think I am retarded or some shit ' he thought bitterly. Despite not showing any signs of mental underdevelopment and always getting good grades in school (' not that the egg donor would care ' thought Arthur, remember the fact that she had never attended even one of the many parent-teacher conferences) , the woman would always call Arthur"" stupid"", ""idiot "", "" retard"","" brainless"", "" fucking mistake"", "" dirt face""



' Impressive how she manages to pronounce all of them right and yet always slurs when she speaks.Must be the drugs getting to her brain. Honestly, it's like all the pills and drugs have sucked out all of her brain matter' he commented. His biological birth giver was no more than a damn ditzy, brainless whore going through a string of boyfriends in the span of one night. 



 He shuddered at the thought of being anything like her or the sperm donor. The egg donor was once a brilliant lady, with a bright future



' Too bloody bad she gave it all up for drugs '



Sperm donor, on the other hand, wasn't known much by Arthur, other than the fact that he fucked egg donor, thus resulting in him being born into this barren, loveless household



' I would rather die than become like them' Arthur concluded strongly



' Hell, I don't even know what that dickhead looks like' 



And Arthur didn't intend on finding out. Sure he like mysteries but this was no interesting one, just a plain and sad one. Two people shagged, the lady got pregnant, birthed child, the child got neglect. 



' What will come next? Me becoming a damn serial killer ? ' he lamented his own fate 



By the age of 8 maybe even 7, Arthur already had known all the swear words and profanities there were in the book. He liked using the terms "" wanker"", "" tosser"","" fanny "", "" bollocks"".He still knew some of the more offensive ones,sex-wise and race-wise, but he didn't like using them much due to their severity.



After the verbal bashing and a few slaps to the face, Arthur quietly walked back to his small room, not able to find a silver of emotions for the woman that wasn't hatred, bitterness, or resentment. He had long stopped caring about her. 



 Cleaning the floor the best his then little 9-year-old hands could, he proceeded to prop his body down on the floor, not bothering or wanting to get on the dirty mattress less than a meter away from him. He closed his eyes, used his hands to try and shut out the moaning going downstairs. He really hoped he wouldn't be getting a half-sibling. They didn't deserve the same fate he was enduring. 


This is why some people just shouldn't be parents.

Now back to the present

Arthur, still holding John's hand in place, ( he was surprisingly strong for a kid of course but John could easily overpower him if he wanted but then again he wasn't a heartless bastard, plus, he actually had morals ), continued pleading John not to hurt the poor creature, that he would just help it and then it would be out of John's sight, all the while holding the little kitten close to his chest, fearing for the little creature's life and also his own. Seeing how John's fists tighten sent him more into a panic attack. He was dealing with an ex-military man, who knows what he was capable of. 

In actuality, John wasn't even mad or upset at Arthur. All his anger was directed to Arthur's ""parent"".

' Hell, that bitch doesn't even deserve such a damn title ' deemed John, honestly wanting to punch the living daylight out of the kid's parents. The mom was sure to receive a sock in the face for neglecting her child to the point of abandoning him in broad fucking daylight. Despite being raised to always respect women, that women were never able to do any harm( what bullshit) , John was still a firm believer in the lifestyle of "" Don't care what you have in your pants,mate if you're a dick, you deserve a kick, preferably in the face or crotch "", though in this situation it should be ""kicks"" 

In the midst of his rambling, Arthur didn't notice that the curious little furball in his care had dropped out of his yellow cardigan. Rolling down the track that was Arthur's legs, the kitten uncurled itself from its ball-like position and looked up at John with its forest green eyes. 

As the little bundle of softness reached for the doctor, he instinctively picked it up, first sliding his hands under its armpits and gingerly lifted it up to his eye level, getting a small ' meow' aimed at him. 

No sooner had John lifted the little creature into his arms than Arthur opened his eyes wide, realising that the kitten was no longer snuggled up in his cardigan.

""Don't- began Arthur in a shaky voice, toe the line of being almost jelly-like. 

"" Lad -John started with a gentle voice, lowering himself more in a subconscious attempt not to frighten Arthur more - I am not going to do anything to the kitten, except nursing it back to health of course "" He finished with a light chuckle, glad to see that Arthur's expression was lightening up.

"" Come on, Arthur. Let me get you cleaned up first "" John said, pulling out a handkerchief ( glad he brought it along) and rubbed the dirt off Arthur's face till he could clearly see the little boy's freckles once again. Next up was pulling the leaves and twigs out of his curly locks, which unexpectedly didn't take so long. Padding off any dirt on his cardigan and trousers, John helped Arthur stand up. 

"" Now mind telling me how a kitten managed to land in your care, lad? "" 

Looking down in slight embarrassment, Arthur began:

"" I-i was looking for plants to observe- Arthur scratched his head in embarrassment. At school, he was considered weird because of his fascination with collecting, observing, and dissecting, fortunately, he often blended in( just another figure in the background)so well that most if not all would just forget that was him. It was one of the many ways he had avoided bullies- I was picking up some snails near a bush and then I saw a bunch of kids, more precisely four- he raised four of his fingers for greater emphasis-, about twelve years old to fourteen years old, throwing pebbles at the poor kitty. I asked them why they were doing that. They said the cat was bad luck and why anyone would miss bad luck. I couldn't let them kill it so I snatched it off the ground and ran off, diving into a bush to hide from the kids.- looking at the ground, he grinded his teeth together- Why those morons would believe in such superstitious gibberish is beyond me "" He said the last sentence in a mutter but still audible enough for John to make it out. 

' Well I am starting to lose hope in humanity ' John thought, absolutely baffled as to why anyone in this time and age would still believe in such nonsense. 

"" I didn't do anything wrong"" Arthur quickly added as if he would be blamed had he not done so. 

"" No, you didn't, Arthur. You did the right thing, lad. Now let's go, we need to buy some stuff for our new little furry guest "" John exclaimed, ruffling Arthur's hair into a puffy mess and letting him take hold of the kitten once again. 

"" Hold its injured leg out for me, please lad? "" John said, pulling a small piece of cloth from his handkerchief. 

"" Okay Mr John"" Arthur replied, doing as he told. 

The small kitten hissed a bit in pain but allowed it nonetheless. 

Looping the cloth around its bleeding leg, John tied a moderately secure knot in hope of not causing it much discomfort. 

"" There, that should do until we get back home and fix the fella up for good ""

Thankfully, a local pet shop was nearby. Walking into the shop with Arthur walking closely behind, John requested a small bottle of disinfectant made for pets and a bag of cat food. 

' I already have bandages and cotton back at home so no need to buy that '

"" Having some father and son time, eh, mate? "" The shop owner asked, a fond smile appearing on her face, giving her a motherly vibe. 

"" U-uh yeah "" John lied, knowing that doing so was better than risk saying no and causing any suspicion on why a grown man was being accompanied by a child that wasn't related to him. Misunderstanding can lead to some very disastrous situations and John wasn't in the mood for any of those. He figured that it was the hair and nose that were making them seem related. 

"" Well make sure to make the best use of these years, kids you know, they grow up so fast, "" The shop owner said fondly, packing up John's purchase before giving it to him with a warm smile

John breathed out a thank you, giving her a friendly smile before bidding her goodbye. Arthur also waved back a goodbye to the lady who waved gleefully. 

' The kid really inherited his dad's smile' she thought before turning around to help another customer who was looking for the perfect brand of food for her picky eater of a parrot. 


Bonus part: a doodle I made of Arthur( i tried guys but at last I am no artist)



 










Hope you enjoy the little flashback, I hope to include them more to give all the characters more depth. It will be a while before Sherlock shows up so buckle up for the ride, my lovelies. And also hope you like the little doodle I made after finishing my exam early

' I hope Mrs Hudson won't mind having a cat roaming around the flat. She has never mentioned any policies against having animals in the flat. ' John thought as he recalled when he first moved into Baker Street. 

Arthur was looking down at the little feline all snuggled up in his cardigan, purring and kneading at the fabric of Arthur's clothing. The creature looked no more than 3 months, its long tail all curled up around its torso. 

On their way home, the kitty would occasionally get a little antsy and start to climb out of the cardigan, either to claw its way to Arthur's head or onto the pavement. Fortunately, they managed to tuck it back to safety before its small head hit the cold, hard concrete underneath. 

Arriving at the flat, John dug through his belongings to pull out a med kit. Reaching into said item, he pulled out some cotton balls and bandages. 

'First, disinfect the wound' 

Soaking the cotton ball in pet disinfectant, he gently dabbed it on the kitten's wound, earning a light hiss from the creature's pink mouth adorned with small yet piercing fangs and a few thrashes in a vain attempt to wiggle it's way out of Arthur's hold. 

After a few minutes and an near assault straight to John's face later, the two of them managed to patch the kitty up, which was now sitting on the sofa ,innocently licking its paw, like it hadn't been an absolute menace to deal with a few moments ago. 

"" You prat "" John said jokingly to the cat taking up residence on the sofa with Arthur sitting beside it,scratching its soft underside.

"" You nearly did a number on my face ""He added, feeling his face for any scratches that he was made unaware of 

Relieved that was none, he relaxed. 

' Injuries on the torso and limbs are easier to cover than ones on the face ' he thought, clutching his right arm. Still stung a little. 

"" Arthur, can you go to the sink and grab a bowl for me, lad? "" To which Arthur gladly obliged, nodding and letting go the soft puffball and heading right to the kitchen. 

John pulled a specific brand of cat food that the shop owner had recommended to him. 

He figured that from an outsider's perspective, this would look eerily domestic, like father and son adopting a pet. 

While he did admit that he liked taking care of people, he feared this would all be temporary. That in a few days, everything would go back to "" normal"" , with John coming home to an empty flat and having to face the illusion of Sherlock that his mind had made, with no one to remind that the Sherlock standing in his flat was not real, that Sherlock wasn't telling him he meant more to him than in actuality( oh how John wished), that Sherlock wasn't telling him to follow him, eyeing the window of the flat or the drawer where John kept his gun and looking back at John, with that bloody knowing grin, showing exactly what the doctor thought the madman was hinting at. 

"" Look at you now John. Taking care of a dull child. How boring "" Fake Sherlock sneered, standing in the hallway in his dressing gown, hair and face looking like he had done an experiment or two. 

' Sod off' John thought, ignoring the abomination that his deranged mind had projected. 

He feared one day he might listen to what fake Sherlock had to say. 

Fake Sherlock was as much of a dick, if not more than the real one. 

"" I am real, John.You know it "" The illusion scoffed back, crossing his arms 

John honestly didn't

He shook his head lightly, relieved to see that when he opened his eyes, Sherlock was gone. 

' Guess I get to keep my sanity for another day' he thought humourlessly 

Seeing Arthur returning with a bowl, John tore open the bag and poured it into the bowl. The rattling of cat kibbles landing into the bowl caught the feline's attention and it started charting towards them, meowing its head off. 

"" Here you go, kitty"" Arthur said, placing the bowl, whose content was quickly being devoured by the cat. 

""Mr John, what is going to happen to kitty? "" Arthur asked 

"" Us nursing it back to health "" He replied, putting the kettle on the stove. He was in great need of a cuppa. 

The rest of the night went on as well as it could. 

In morning, John was up making breakfast when Arthur came down, still a bit sluggish and dozy after awakening from his slumber. 

"" Why didn't you sleep in the other bedroom, Mr John? You look horrible."" He asked absent-mindedly

John froze, he never told Arthur about Sherlock's bedroom. 

""W-what? "" Managed John

"" Your flatmate's bedroom, I am sure he wouldn't mind "" Arthur replied, still a bit too sleepy to acknowledge the fact that his mouth was slipping too much

His response astonished John even more

"" How did you? "" 

Still sleepy and not hit by self-realization that he was showing his other side that he rarely put on display. It always managed to freak people out. 

"" The flat is too big for you, a man living alone, to need or even want, given your humble appearance and personality,not to mention it is in the centre of the city. I assume you have a flatmate. Yesterday morning, I noticed you had slept on the couch, indicated by your hair,posture, pillow and blanket on the couch. At first I thought it was because the two of you weren't close but the style and arrangement of furniture here said otherwise. One would never want their belongings to mingle with those of a being they don't trust. The inside of the bedroom was dusty so perhaps he hasn't been home for a while .-

Looking around the flat, John realized that every one of Sherlock's belongings were still here, every single one taunting him about the death of the detective. 'Yesterday I noticed a dressing gown, made for male.It was too big for you so I concluded your flatmate was male -'

As if his brain had finally flipped on the emotional intelligence switch , it dawned on Arthur that he was getting too comfortable around John, letting out useless speculations like that. They were correct, going by John's reaction.But it was basically asking for a ridicule or worse, a beating. 

Arthur managed his best not to tremble, reaching into his cardigan to catch a feel of the pocket knife. Despite knowing he was safe, his body just decided that danger was near and he needed to go paranoid. 

"" Brilliant"" was not the reaction he had expected, even without the additional anxiety. 

"" W-what? You're not mad or annoyed"" It was Arthur's turn to be confused. 

"" Of course not, well surprised yes - John began, walking towards Arthur and crouching down- but I am not angry, I told when you came here that you would be safe ""

"" Sorry, Mr John"" He said instinctively, he always made sure to apologize for whatever it was that was upsetting anyone. No one ever bothered to tell what he did wrong.

John's glaze softened

"" You don't need to apologize, Arthur. ""

"" Do you want to talk about your flatmate, Mr John? "" Arthur asked, noticing the choke John forced down, like he was going to say something and then decided not to. 

"" It's too sensitive for you, lad ""

A bit indignant, Arthur said back:"" Mr John, you have already witnessed me having two breakdowns. I know more than the average kid should ""

The man had done so much for him these last few days, the least he could do was offer a sympathetic ear. 

' Maybe he loves the flatmate ' thought Arthur. ' that would explain so much. Maybe he died and Mr John never had the opportunity to confess his feelings. Unrequited love perhaps? Seem possible ' 


 I don't want you near any of those filthy sinners 


The egg donor's voice echoed within the premises of his skull

' Wrong'

He always thought the hatred was unnecessary and frankly disgusting. The world was overpopulated enough as it was, with all the accidental babies here and there, him being one himself.What was wrong with letting people love freely? To Arthur's mind, who you shag didn't matter nearly as much as your personality. 

John let out a chuckle , one he hadn't had the privilege of having for some time now. Arthur thought he should laugh more. 

"" Well you ask for this, lad. Just don't blame me when you get traumatized "" Setting up another chair to sit on, John began:

"" His name was Sherlock Holmes and he, despite being an arrogant dickhead, a genius with no people skills whatsoever , was the best thing to happen to my life""

"" How does one be arrogant and still be considered in good light by anyone? "" Arthur muttered but going by John's uproarious laugh, he probably overheard it

"" That's what I thought too. But he just made me feel alive again, he saved me in a way. I wish I could have done the same. "" John began to choke up, Arthur tried to comfort him like he had done for him, placing his hand on John's forearm, to which John immediately jerked back due to the sharp sting

"" So-sorry lad, I got startled. That's all "" John lied through his teeth. 

"" Now eat up your breakfast before it gets cold""

A meow interrupted their conversation

"" I guess kitty is also hungry "" John remarked as he saw the little furry head popping out, stretching its petite body,its claw on full display. 

"" I will take care of it, Mr John "" Arthur said, snatching the cat food to go feed the hungry knife retractor. 

He wondered how long this would last 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Getting Mrs Hudson to agree with the cat staying here wasn't as trialing as John had imagined. Once she saw the puny little puffball popping out it's head and meowing at her, showing its tiny squishy toe beans , Lord knows she couldn't resist such cuteness. 

"" Fine, you can keep the little fur ball in the flat but remember to take care of it. I am not your housekeeper, dear "" She said, pointing a finger in a teacher-like manner to John, who was nodding sheepishly, just glad that he managed to overcome this trivial trial. Turning back to Arthur, she pulled out a small bag of cookies. 

"" Here dear, have some goodies, you need some fattening up "" She said, pinching Arthur's soft cheek

"" Thank you Mrs Hudson"" Arthur replied, practically beaming. 

Something about this scene just warmed John's fractured heart. 

"" Why would you take such an interest in such a dull and predictable pest? Surely I am much more fascinating"" Echoed the illusion taking the imagine of the dead as he stood near the innocent kitten napping soundly, face twisted into a snarl, before averting his attention to Arthur already with a chocolate chip cookies hanging from his mouth

"" Absolutely dull and idiotic "" He scoffed, accompanied with a dramatic flick of his hand. 

' Well this Sherlock is probably even more of a prick than the real one.

Probably '

Taking in a deep breath, John told himself that once Arthur and the cat were relocated to a safer place, he would have all the time in the world to break down ,cry and relieve the stress within the walls of confinement, without any judgement or pity from any living beings 

"" It's terribly dull, John.It's simply not interesting to be alive anymore . Everyone is an idiot compared to me. They would bring you down to being ordinary- Disgust immediately got plastered on the detective's face - Why don't you follow my guide and join me already? We can be together again"" The baritone voice spoke again, still as rich and velvety as the first time John had heard it.

' Look mind, if you arsehole is going to recreate an illusion in the shape of Sherlock bloody Holmes, at least make it accurate and not based on what I damn bollocking feel about the madman ' John thought,muttering to himself that the real Sherlock "" married to my work "" Holmes would never say the last part, that sentiment to Sherlock was basically what dead body parts kept in the fridge was to ordinary people disgusting beyond comprehension, except in Sherlock's case, it was with an addition of hatred, indifferent and inferiority. 

Even if John had had the balls to confess before all this, it would most certainly have just ended up in John being mocked and ridiculed for his "" idiotic and superfluous feelings "" by the mad genius himself. Hearing that would probably devastate him. 

' Though maybe I should have told him, better getting hurt and then having my feelings rejected than whatever the damn tossing hell this is .And Sherlock would forget about it in a day or two, at most, given how he always deletes useless memories '

John honestly thought it would have been better if he had just got rejected by Sherlock. It would be better to just bear some hurtful ,sharper than a knife and sting worse than a bullet wound words , put on a smile and move on.It would have helped him get over this turmoil of his faster and get some closure. 

Killing one's feelings is always so much more manageable if the object of your affection wants nothing to do with you. What is better for your feelings,a quick death or a slow one dragged out unnecessarily long and painful that it lefts a massive hole in your chest and makes you wonder what is wrong with you. 

"" So what is her name, John? "" Mr Hudson asked, having two handfuls of fluff in her hands, tickling the kitten's soft and pump tummy. 

John stopped for a moment, he hadn't thought of keeping the cat indefinitely. Pets take a lot of responsibility and mental stability, something that he wasn't even sure if it was still in his possession or not. 

"" I... haven't gotten that far yet? "" He admitted 

"" Typical of you, John "" Fake Sherlock remarked in a huff , brows furrowed together, face grimacing ,teeth baring, still glaring daggers at the two new guests of the flat. 

Glancing quickly at the deranged hallucination that his broken mind had conjures up with all his guilt, grief and doubt 

"" I am real, John. Do stop being an idiot "" He retaliated as if knowing what John was thinking

' Then again, Sherlock always did so kudo to you brain for getting that right, you prick '

"" CLAWDIA "", a child-like voice boomed 

"" Her name will be Clawdia. "" Arthur added, eyes looking at the little ball of cuteness nomming on one of her paws. 

"" Is that okay, Mr John, Mrs Hudson? ""He asked, looking for affirmation. 

"" That's a good name, Arthur"" John responded with a smile 

"" It's lovely, dear"" Mrs Hudson followed, patting the boy's curly head of hair, amazed at how soft and fine it was. Then again blond do general have finer strands of hair. The rest of the morning and afternoon was the same old thing, going to work, dealing with incompetent patients who apparently couldn't even tell the truth about how they forgot to take their medication on time. One even had the audacity to accuse John of giving her cheap medicine and one particularly unsavory man was just boasting all about his nights of passion with all the young, hot curvaceous ladies

' Yes, Mr Harness the story of your carelessness leading to you getting AIDS is so inspiring that I am about to drop down and cry .Oh bloody blimey the inspiration!!' was what John had to resort to biting his tongue to keep from spilling out. Last week, one of his fellow co-workers had slipped up and made a comment on a patient's health,which was no doubt true in every sense of the word and was just made in attempt to show concern but the patient just threw a damn hissy fit, threatening to sue the clinic for "" defamation of her character "" . 

' Rich considering she insulted one of the sweetest janitors there is in the whole clinic the moment she walked her diabetic arse in here ' judged John as he finally was done listening to the bastard's conquests and sent him off with a dry smile and an indifferent goodbye which were hard to distinguish from his real ones, something he was immensely glad for.

Finally time for his lunch break, John let out a sigh of utmost relief, thanking all the holy beings in the damn universe. 

Reaching into his bag to pull out his wrapped sandwich and tea thermos, he was about dig in when Sarah walked into his office. 

"" Oh hey Sarah, what brings you here? "" John greeted, putting his lunch down. 

""Can't I just want to chat with a friend,John? "" She said playfully

"" Fair enough. So what's up? "" John replied, unwrapping his sandwich and opening his tea thermos 

"" Oh I'm fine. And you, John? "" 

The stiffness in her voice and the undoubtedly strained smile made John's eyebrows raise. Finally a lightbulb lit up above his head and he frowned

"" Sarah, you don't need to unwillingly talk to me just cause I look lonely ""

The fake smile immediately got washed off her face. 

"" John- her voice softened, fill with pity and..... maybe concern, John wasn't sure - I am just worried about you. Ever since that day, you have been.... down. You rarely speak to any of us unless necessary. ""

John was about to open his mouth but Sarah was fast. 

"" I know that your work performance is just as good as always but you should know that I am not just your boss, I am your friend and i'm worry about you. In fact all your co-workers are. You know you can tell us if anything bothers you"" 

' Can I really ? What if I told you that I have been having vivid almost eerie illusion of my dead flatmate that is always urging me to follow him? Would you still look at me with those sympathetic eyes? Would any of you do? '

"" Sarah, I appreciate your concern over your employee but really, I am fine. I'm a grown man, not some small fetus, I can take care of myself ""

"" If you say so, John but promise me that if anything happens, you will seek help "" Sarah's eyes pierced through his soul. Oh how he hated those looks packed with so much pity, it was like he was some broken thing that would break at the slightest touch of the wind. 

"" I promise "" He said, forcing a lump in his throat

And with that Sarah was out of the door, leaving John with an utter loss of appetite. He quietly wrapped back his uneaten sandwich and took a large gulp of his tea, trying hard to keep it together. 

The rest of his shift continued as normal, thankfully his last patients were sick children, accompanied by their concerned but not so aggressive parents. The kids were well-behaved, albeit a bit shy, which was something John understood given how much children are afraid of doctors with all their needles and bitter pills. 

After bidding the patients and their parents goodbye, John packed up his things, took of his lab coat and went home. 

 

Finally after a fuck ton of mid term exams , I am back with some more final mid term exams but no worries I will try to update as soon as possible ( thank you my school allow students to use their phones after they finish work) , . Anyway hope you enjoy the latest chapter, I am astonished as how far we have come but there is still a long way to go so buckle up my dear. Remember to comment, give kudo or bookmark my work you want to see more


Two days later 


' I wonder when the DNA results will come? ' John questioned( for the fifth time these past two days) while reading the newspaper with Arthur sitting beside reading one of his medical documents on the topic of cancer and Clawdia in the doctor's lap. It was 10 am already and normally John would be at work dealing with his first or second patient of the day ,fortunately for John , he didn't have to go to work today. 

Putting down the newspaper, he looked over to Arthur 

"" Hey Arthur, I'm going to Tesco to get some grocery. Would you like to go with me, lad? "" 

"" Can I ? "" Arthur asked, not used to being able to go anywhere far from home. Mother said that she couldn't bear being seen with him

"" Of course lad "" John chuckled, letting Clawdia jump off his lap before standing up to grab his overcoat. 

Entering the dairy aisle, John picked up three bottles of milk and rested them in the basket before getting every else that they needed. Bread, butter, vegetables, pasta, rice, some chicken breasts,.. 

Turning over and seeing Arthur eyeing the candy aisles

"" Arthur, time to go, lad ""

"" O-okay, Mr John ""

Exiting the shop, John reached in one of the plastic grocery bags

"" Here, lad "" He said, letting the chocolate bar land in Arthur's hands

A look of confusion appeared on his freckled face. 

"" Consider it a little treat for all the help with the meals these past few days"" 

Having walked for a few minutes, John noticed that a certain slick black car had been following them for a while now. Wanting to confirm his suspicious, he glanced back at the car. 

' Oh bloody course ' he thought, recognize the iconic design of the car sent by the Ice Man himself. 

As the car got closer to them on the empty street

' Prefect place to kidnap someone ' acknowledged John. He wasn't going to get involved in any of this. 

Holding Arthur's hand tighter in fear of getting the boy involved whatever that the government usually encountered, John picked up his pace and consequently Arthur's. 

"" Mr John- he wheezed at first, a bit confused but catching a glimpse of the car approaching them closer by the passing second made him realize at least part of the reason why John was suddenly anxious to get home. 

They were being followed. 

As they were about to enter a busy street in hope of losing sight of the car, a voice caught their attention. 

"" JOHN, LISTEN TO US "" It was Anthea- well at least that was what she wanted John to refer to her as, with her head poking out of the car. 

"" So the bloody British Government is so lazy that he can't even oversee a kidnapping committed in his personal interest "" retaliated John, turning around to get a good look at his supposed kidnapper. ( or kidnappers - after all Mycroft's minions never worked alone) 

The hard, stoic glare he had was mixed with a bit of confusion after witnessing the assistant's expression who actually looked...................................................................... worried and a bit shocked 

' It's a trick ' his brain shouted 

"" I'm not getting in the car "" John stood his ground, awaiting for the next persuasion from the assistant, putting himself in front of Arthur, who was clinging onto John's forearm,to create a barrier between the boy and the car. 

"" John, please just listen to us. I beg of you "" Anthea pleaded, still wearing a distraught expression. Either what she had to say was true or she was a damn excellent actress. 

' Or it could be neither and I'm just a damn fucking idiot ' John reprimanded himself

Ignoring the sharp sting that emitted from his forearm due to Arthur's clinging ( it wasn't the boy's fault anyway. Only John's) , John was about to open his mouth to tell Anthea to fuck off and leave them alone. 

"" Please, John. This concerns Sherlock "" 

That line made John freeze, every single muscle of his suddenly forgetting how to relax. 

"" H-has his name finally been cleared? "" He asked, not vocalising what he really wanted to ask

Anthea shook her head sadly "" No, we're still looking into it. But I beg you, John,just get in the car "" . A hint of desperation could be detected in her voice. 

John considered for a moment, before glancing back at the young boy currently in his care. 

"" No."" He said sternly "" I'm not getting Arthur involved in whatever you government officials do "", a vague gesture of his hand was added to emphasize his point. 

"" Please, John. It's a matter of utmost importance to Mycroft"" 

Covering his face with his free hand, he took one last look at Arthur, who simply wore a look of confusion but otherwise no visible signs of fear. 

Cursing under his breath, he finally gave in. 

"" Fine but if anything happens to Arthur here, I swear to all the holy deities in the bloody universe, I will strangle all of you tossers with my bare hands "" Threatened John as he and Arthur got escorted into the fancy black as night car. 

"" Thank you, John "" breathed Anthea before ordering the driver to keep driving. 

"" Mr John--Arthur said, finally managing to get back his voice -- Who are they? "" 

John let out a long sigh of exhaustion. Where would he even begin. 

"" People sent by a nosy, overprotective government official"" John informed before pulling Arthur into a hug to ease off some of his anxiety

"" Don't worry, lad. I won't let them hurt you "" John reassured, thankful that he still kept his gun close to him today 

' Thank god for oversized jumpers ' he thought, reaching down his waist to catch a feel of the butt of the gun. 

Arriving at Mycroft's manor , they were let off and escorted to his royal Umbrella himself. 

' Posh git ' thought John as he took in the fancy decor of the manor. He admitted that it was beautiful and elegant but personally it was a bit too flamboyant for his taste. Then again the Holmes brothers were known for being drama queens. 

He swore if there was a sniper awaiting their arrival at the end of the escort, he would find Mycroft and murder him using the man's precious umbrella. It didn't matter if John would make it out alive or not, he was still going to murder that bastard. 

"" Mr Holmes awaits you, Dr Watson"" The escort said, opening the fancy carved wooden door to reveal none other than Mycroft Holmes himself , sitting in his designated chair, with a "" Don't be afraid, be terrified "" look on his thin face. 

' Look like the tosser hasn't slept in days ' John noted, taking in the man's heavy bags and haggard face,usually the doctor in him would rise to the occasion but he couldn't exactly muster a care now. 

"" What's it now, Mycroft? Oh let me guess. You're going to kill me to erase every evidence of Sherlock's suicide. If it is then just do it you fucking bastard. Just leave the kid alone. He isn't involved in this, you heartless tosser "" John spat, signalling Arthur to get behind him. He knew he wasn't making much sense now but honestly he could care less. 

"" Rest assured, John. I won't do such a thing. It would be like going against my dear brother's wish-- John rolled his eyes -- This is a difficult time for you. I understand why you would hold such animosity for me. I truly love my brother, there is simply no doubt about it. I devoted a great majority of my time to making sure of his well-being-- His voice stiffened for a moment before continuing-- Yet I am partially to blame for his........ permanent departure from us. However, I understand that your companionship with him, though shorter than the number of years I spent knowing him, was more directly emotional than my fraternal, and somewhat paternal, affection for Sherlock. Whatever turmoil I am suffering now is only a fraction of yours"" 

John struggled to stop the burning of his eyes and the lump in his throat. 

"" Now you're just pulling my leg. Look. If you're going to start getting sentimental about his death then you should have done so during his funeral. If this is all you're going to do now then excuse us but we're leaving"" John said, holding Arthur's hand gently , ready to guide him and himself to the exit. 

"" WAIT, DR WATSON "" shouted Mycroft, "" This isn't what I had you come here for. Like my assistant has informed you, this matter concerns Sherlock ""

"" Unless it's about his name being cleared, I don't want to hear it. Damn sake, Mycroft, I have a child in my care "" 

"" Why yes I can see that, as a matter of fact he is why we're having this discussion "" Mycroft said, glancing at Arthur hiding behind John, like a scared duckling hiding behind momma duck, only that this duck wasn't scared but rather upset and angry, with a clear grimace plastered on his face. 

Clearing his throat, Mycroft continued:"" You see, John, before meeting you and consequently getting back on his track, my brother did some unsavoury deeds, many of which are kept as secrets shared only between us. Since your arrival, I am sure you have heard a good deal of said secrets. However, I am afraid that there are some deeds with serious consequences that I was unaware of and , thus, couldn't take action in time--

"" Oh just get to the point, you twat "" John snapped, patience wearing thin with every passing moment spent listening to him. 

"" I believe that in cases like this, seeing is preferably better than hearing"" The government official responded, unfazed, before reaching into his drawer to pull out a file and handing it to John, who looked at it suspiciously, as if there was going to be a bomb popping out 

Opening up the file , it was revealed to be a DNA result, in particularly, a paternity one. John traced over the information ( just all the standard conclusions of a DNA test)before his eyes landed on this one particular part. 


Child : Arthur Miller



Alleged Father : Sherlock Holmes 



Probability of Paternity= 99.999%


The floor seemed to shake and come to a stop simultaneously the moment the two blonds got hold of the information. It all made sense now, it was a truth John had been denying for the past days .Suddenly, for once, John was dead on correct and he wished he hadn't been. Looking at Arthur, all he could see was Sherlock's face. 

Honestly if the high-functioning sociopathic bastard was still alive now, John would probably kill him with his bare hands and then use his gun to shoot the bastard's face off. 

And for once in the history of being inconsiderate to other's feelings, his royal  Microsoft, oh great powerhouse of Great Britain actually and graciously gave the two of them time to process the shock. 

After a few minutes, Mycroft continued with the discussion

"" As you can see, it seems that my brother, Sherlock ,made yet another mistake during his drug-ridden foolish years ""

' Mistake'. Oh how that word made Arthur want to rip out the man's throat, if only he could get close enough and dip his pocket knife deep in his throat, ripping out the windpipe.

 ' well hello there violent thought . Glad to see you're up ' he thought. 

Clutching the DNA results in his hand, John felt like he was being torn in two different directions. Adding to the already as complicated as a twelfth grade geometric equation feelings he harboured for the detective was anger and a hint-- NO a fuck ton of disappointment towards how careless and bloody irresponsible Sherlock had been. 

HELL WHY SHOULDN'T HE? The tosser's action led to a child, a living being with emotions and feelings, being born in a loveless household. It amazed John how the boy even survived to this day to find out about his sperm donor of a father who was never in the picture and never would be because he was dead now, buried six feet underground with his name being tainted by rumours and quick arse conclusions. What kind of kid deserved this? 

He hoped --no prayed that Sherlock hadn't been aware of the existence of Arthur during his time of living. Because if the wanker had and had chosen not to do anything for his child then John really had to consider his sense of judgement and his taste in potential love interests. 

' Maybe I should scratch the ""potential"" part out ' echoed John's mind

"" John, as much as I know that this news is rather................................ jarring. I myself was also taken aback by the result. Never thought there would a day that I would become an uncle, at least from a genetic standpoint. But we must move forward to other matters, in particularly Arthur's accommodation . Now I don't think you would mind introducing me to my nephew "" Mycroft said, looking at Arthur( who was staring right back at him with those those big round eyes of his, unlike the Holmes brothers' cat-like ones) his glaze suddenly softened , as if reminiscing of a simpler time and the imagine of a once small exquisite child. 

"" I do have to say, he is much more well-behaved than my brother was when he was young "" Crouching his ridiculously tall frame down, finally able to take a good look at his newly discovered nephew. 

"" This is truly ironic "" He added in a whisper, almost wearing a sad smile, noticing Arthur's hair ( a sandy shade of blond similar to John's) and nose ( small, round ( just like John's) , giving his face a more good-natured appearance rather than the sharp and ethereal one of his father and uncle)

Would he even see them as such? 

' Eleven years ' that was how long Mycroft had remained ignorant of his existence. Frankly, even he ( as arrogant and prideful of a Holmes he was ) had to admit that all of this was unexpected and shocking to say the least. Trailing his eyes down to Arthur's clothes( old, worn and simply didn't fit him), he noticed some tell-tale signs of the boy's rather unhappy home life. 

' That simply won't do ' he made a tsking sound in his throat. 

' Never thought he would  do something so reckless like this, even taking into account his drug addiction at the time ' he thought sadly, a bit of disappointment on his face 

Unfortunately, in Arthur's eyes, the disappointment was directed at him, the mistake that should never have happened, a drug baby whose existence only came to be because of two individuals' horniness and carelessness, a creature that was well on the way of getting rejected by his sperm donor 's side of the family. 

' At least I can figure a way to survive in an orphanage or in foster care. Well it was nice knowing Mr John' he thought melancholically, accepting his fate. What else could he, a powerless child with no rights, do? 

"" I will arrange for all the essentials for him to be sent to you "" Mycroft said, breaking the silence. 

"" W-what? "" John inquired, honestly expecting less of the government official. Maybe he really did have a heart under all that ice and fancy suits. 

"" All the financial support and materials for him to grow up, of course. With you as his guardian"", elaborated the umbrella carrying man. 

"" Yeah I get that, Mycroft, but why me? "" John asked, already having deemed himself as unqualified. 

Arthur hoped John wasn't hinting at the fact that he disliked being with him. 

"" I am afraid I will be unavailable to take up that position for the upcoming period. You see, John, the government has caught wind of my breaching information about Sherlock's suicide, I will soon be up for an examination. Should I prove to be more of an inconvenience than an asset, I will be terminated "" He answered, taking in John's look and what he was thinking. 

"" It is exactly what you think, John. To make this matter worse, every individual, no matter what age, that is involved will also be dealt with, leaving no trace whatsoever. That's why I can't take Arthur under my wing "" 

John's face paled and twisted in disgust

"" You heartless bastards would murder an innocent child? ""

"" Unfortunately, that how things work in my profession "" said Mycroft sadly, his eyes slowly looking down. 

"" I acknowledge that it's a hard favour to ask of you but if you can't do it for me then at least do it for Sherlock's child "", pleaded the Ice Man

' He isn't just Sherlock's child . He's more than that' thought John

"" I will do it "" He replied determinedly, not too keen on the idea of an innocent life being taken . 

"" Thank you John. You must know that I, by and large, don't want to put my newly discovered nephew in harm way. I have already lost my brother, I can't make the same mistake again. "" 

"" I know, Mycroft "" was John's only response. 

Before he could stand up right and walk back to Arthur, he heard a small whisper from the government official 

"" You might want to do a check up on the boy, John"" 

Before he could demand a further explanation, the two of them were already in the process of being escorted back to John's- well their home. 

"" Well Mrs Hudson is going to be baffled "" said John as they returned to Baker Street, with a great piece of news to tell the landlady and the fact that Arthur was going to stay here longer than initially intended. 

' What has my life come to? ' he said, flopping himself down to the sofa. 

"" Hey lad, you're alright? You have been a little tad quiet "" John asked, concerned about the fact Arthur had been non-verbal through their entire trip home. 

It took a moment for John's question to register in Arthur's mind

"" I-i just didn't think I would ever find out sperm donor-- no father's identity, let alone his death. "" He said, with his legs pulled up to his chest and his arms wrapped around them, too uncomfortable to even say the word ""father"" without feeling repulsed yet he still pulled through with the intention of not making John upset,clutching his hair in an attempt to make sense of something, anything. It was like the fabric of reality was collapsing in front of him. He wished he hadn't seen Sherlock's picture, at first he was puzzled as to why the two of them looked similar , but now , knowing the truth,he couldn't look into the mirror without the thought of becoming like him plaguing his already messed up mind. 

What if they're just keeping you to fill his place? A Sherlock Junior? 

That thought haunted him. He could already feel another the urge to peel away his face in order not to look like him. 

' Maybe if I pull out my eyes, I won't have to deal with this ' thought Arthur darkly, deeming his issues as messed up and ridiculous. Normal kids didn't have these thoughts poking at their minds, tearing them apart and yet still leaving enough for them to acknowledge how fucked up they were. 

"" You don't have to call him that if you are uncomfortable to do it, Arthur"" assured John softy, feeling the tension in the boy's voice. 

"" B-but you love him, don't you? Disrespecting him means disrespecting you "" whispered Arthur, not even understanding his own emotions.  He hated, resented the sperm donor for years, maybe even all of his life. He hated how he existed because of him, hated the fact he was messed up because of them. He hated the fact he was nothing but an accident, a mistake made in the high heat of the moment by two individuals who weren't in their right bloody mind. 

' Why couldn't the egg donor just have a damn abortion back then? Did she really want to see me suffer? ' lamented Arthur, thinking how easy it would be to just wrap his hands around his own neck and squeeze hard. It would hurt but the pain would be worth it in his mind. After all the pain, there would only be silence, a forever state of slumber. He frankly thought it was tempting

John stopped for a moment. Was his love for Sherlock that obvious? He always thought of Sherlock as not being interested in sex or romance, but now the proof of how Sherlock had been completely able to get it on just fine was sitting right before his eyes . 

' Idiot, it was just a scratching of a biological itch to him. He didn't love anyone. Even if he had, that person wouldn't have been you ' his brain reprimanded him. 

' No  this isn't about me .This is about Arthur ' decided John , mentally punching himself for being so self centered. After all  he was nothing but a puppy following the genius ,stroking his ego with praises and making him feel so superior to others. 


That was all he had been, no more no less


"" Come here ,lad-- he said  pulling Arthur into a hug , letting the boy cry all over his shoulder, -- it's okay, everything will be fine, I promise. What's in the past is in the past, I know it's a lot to take in. But there's no need to worry , as your guardian, I will help you through it ""

' But then who will help you ,Mr John ? "" thought Arthur, whose throat was too clogged up with all the crying and hiccuping to voice out his thought. 

 

 

I am back, my darling, please let me know what you think of the latest chapter.

 

For the sake of confidentiality and protection of Arthur, for the time being ( at least until the news about Sherlock's suicide died down), the news wasn't disclosed to anyone( otherwise the poor boy would be bombarded by the press within hours) ,aside from John, Lestrade( due to him being the one to suggest the DNA exam)and Mrs Hudson. 

Speaking of telling Mrs Hudson the news. 

The next morning was when all the stuff needed to take care of a child that Mycroft had arranged for was sent to the flat. There were clothes, study equipment, toothbrush, footwear, books, even toys such as a teddy bear and among many other things that John thought was simply too much. He wasn't even sure that all these would fit in the flat without removing some of his own things.............................................. or Sherlock's. 

' The wanker really thought it through ' John facepalmed, a bit amazed at how fast the transition was. 

' It's like he expected all of this and prepared in advance, although it's more likely that he just had a bunch of people buy everything at the child section of the mall. ' 

Before John was able to think further into the working mechanic of bloody Mycroft Holmes, he was met with a confused squeal. Walking upstairs taking two steps at a time, he was soon greeted with the appearance of Mrs Hudson, who were trying to nudge through the crowd of Mycroft's minions while wearing a puzzled expression as to why there were people carrying boxes among boxes of things into John's flat. The other tenants were equally baffled, whispering to each other and asking what was with all the people wearing all black entering John's flat while carrying boxes. Honestly to the outsider's view, it looked like a bloody FBI raid or rather aid in this case ( complete with people wearing all blacks and covering their faces with masks). 

Delivering the news to Mrs Hudson was.........., in a way, like reliving the shock for John. 

At first, Mrs Hudson thought it was a prank ( oh how John wished ) but one look at John's expression and the recollection of Sherlock's history had her no longer doubtful. To make sure of getting rid of any lingering doubt the kind landlady might still cling to, he produced the daunting DNA result, now wrinkled due to him squeezing it in his trance , from his drawer and handed it to her. 

"" Oh poor thing - she exclaimed, raising her hand to cover her agape mouth, with which John could only silently agree - First abandoned by his mother and now he found out his father is dead. Oh if Sherlock were still alive and I could find that nasty woman, I would strangle them both "" She continued in a hiss, angry at the sweet boy's misfortune.

"" Oh you and me both ,Mrs H "" John replied, waiting for the crowd of people to be done with their job so he could proceed with his mundane routine. He hoped the people wouldn't bother Arthur who was in the living room playing with Clawdia last time he saw him, which was only 10 minutes before all this aid came in. 

After all the ruckus, John was glad to see the backs of Mycroft's people. Entering the flat, he first saw Arthur sitting on sofa with Clawdia sitting contentedly on the top of his curly head. John felt an amused grin creep up on his face. 

"" The people were moving around and she got scared so I let her rest on my head "" Arthur explained, feeling the feline jumping off his head to resume her daily mischief, before starting to stare off into the distance again. 

' The lad really has got a staring problem'

"" So- how are you taking this, lad? ""John asked, not exactly expecting an answer. The kid was doing significantly better than he imagined. Not everyone could stay calm after being abandoned by their mother and then discovering that their father was dead through their government official of an uncle, at least that was what they were to him biologically. But being biologically linked doesn't always ensure a close bond

"" Better than the standard kids my age, I guess "" He replied bluntly, before looking down, looking he had to ask something but was too afraid to do so.

' Fingers fidgeting in an attempt to get hold of something,eye slightly twitching, legs shifting in discomfort. ' the doctor noted. 

"" Ok, out with it,Arthur "" John said, crossing his arms, his face soft but firm. He wasn't going let the kid bottle up his emotions just like Sherlock. 

' You think he had emotions. You are pathetic ' John quickly shoved that into his chamber of unwanted emotions, adding more locks and chains to further ensure its entrapment. He didn't have the sanity to deal with this for the time being 

"" W-what? "" Arthur responded in a defensive tone, fingers curling together, eyes staring piercingly, just like Sherlock when he had been in one of his dark moods. 

John sighed at the resemblance. 

' Not now, you bloody loony ' he thought, reprimanding himself. He could almost hear the tone Sherlock used when insulting him. 


  You're an idiot, John  


' Dear god, maybe in my next session, Ella will put me in the psych ward if I disclose this to her. Next thing I know, I may be wearing a straitjacket and locked in a padded cell ' he lamented, a bit torn between telling or not telling his therapist about his vivid hallucinations. The first time he had told her, she had advised him some methods and tricks to get rid of the visions. And they had worked .............................................................. for a while before the visions had gotten more vivid and more convincing. It was unbearable, everyday waking up and being expected to act like you're still okay in the head when you are clearly not. At this point, he might as well be considered clinically insane and depressed. In spite of the desperate attempt at humour,John feared one day he might believe them, the dreaded visions of Sherlock that were always telling him how much he meant to the detective and that with just one pull of the trigger, they would be together again, as if no one had never left. 

' Oh never mind with these thoughts and visions, I have a child to take care of ' 

Once again repressing his emotions, John cleared his throat before speaking in a soft voice. 

"" Arthur, I know you want to ask me something. It's okay to do so, you have the right to know about him"" He said, expecting the boy to inquire information about his biological father. No matter how much the boy resented his parents ( which was understandable, taking into account his circumstances), he must be interested in knowing what kind of person Sherlock had been during his living time, maybe in order to validate or invalidate his resentment towards the dead. 

It was like an eternity had passed when Arthur decided to speak. 

"" I don't want to make you upset. "" He said, before lowering his head down

"" This is ridiculous, utterly ridiculous"" said the boy in whisper.

John was a bit taken aback. "" W-what? ""

"" Six days, not counting today, that was how long you have known me and I have known you, Mr John. It's hardly enough time for anyone to form attachments to anyone and yet you have done nothing but showed me kindness. I just don't understand, I can't comprehend why you would do this. You even helped me take care of a stray cat I found. - He slowly reached for his face, the one that he was slowly growing to hate, despite knowing how illogical it was to do so ( Am I that insane and illogical ?) - Is it because I look like him that you treat me so well. You think I am going to become like h-him, don't you? That I will become a Sherlock Junior."" His hands were starting to shake and move like he was trying choke something. Why was it that he cared so much about making John upset? 

' Nice job, stupid. Now he will truly think you're fucked up, you soon-to-be-serial-killer' 

"" I don't want to become like him. I don't want to become like either of them "" Pictures of white powder, colourful pills contained within bottles and the rattling of the containers of alcoholic drink were bombarding his senses. Why couldn't he be a normal kid with a happy home life? Why was he so sacred of becoming like his parents? What if his father wasn't so bad and he was disrespecting him in front of the person who loved him? 

He was going to get into trouble

' Maybe I am just being a lunatic, there are other kids who have had it worse than me. So why am I like this? Why am I such a freak, a weirdo, a mistake?'

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"" Just forget it, please Mr John"" Arthur suddenly said, standing up to walk to his room- well it was John's but it was being used as Arthur's for the time being. It was an attempt to shut off the conversation to avoid spilling out bottled feelings. 

Reaching out to hold Arthur's arm, to hold him  back from furthering his plan of bottling his feelings ( he couldn't let him do that, not after Sherlock ), he was surprised to receive a sharp hiss of pain coming from Arthur, who was trying hard not to let John know but did a rather poor job hiding the pained expression painted on his face 


You might want to do a check up on the boy, John


' It can't be ' he thought  despite knowing how absurdly likely it was for this to be true. 

He quickly brought Arthur closer, pulling up the sleeves of his oversized shirt ,in spite of the boy's protest. His stomach dropped like a large boulder sitting on top of an unstable platform when the sight of the bruises and cuts littered on both of Arthur's arm caught his attention ( greenish brown, happened about a week prior ,showing signs of healing but seem to still cause him pain ). Some of the bruises were in shape of a hand, a woman's to be precise. John hurried checked the boy's torso, only to discover that it was in similar state. There were signs of healing but risk of infections was not negligible. 

"" Sit down now Arthur "" John said, pulling the boy toward the sofa, before going to fetch the med kit. Arthur only silently obliged. 

"" You should have told me earlier, lad. "" He continued upon returning. "" It may be a little painful. Bear with it a bit, okay? "", bringing up a ball of cotton soaked in disinfectant to more recent wounds. Arthur hissed at the contact but remained well-behaved nonetheless. 

"" Don't worry, it will soon pass "" reassured John, doctor mode activating. After cleaning all the wounds properly and applying medicine to them, he moved on to his torso. 

' No broken ribs ' relieved John

 

 

Arthur's torso had suffered some wounds, similar to his arms, but thankful none of his ribs were broken, although there were some cuts and scratches that needed to be cleaned and bandaged to prevent future infections. Tracing his fingers across the boy's torso, John was a bit horrified to how malnourished he was ( not to the point of ribs poking out but he was close). John was glad that his mother had abandoned him sooner than later. He wondered how much longer Arthur would have survived if he had still been in his mother's care. The image of an emaciated Arthur on the verge of being beaten to death flashed before his eyes but he quickly shook it off, resuming his task of tending the very much alive and on the way of getting better boy before him. 
"" There ya go - John said, finally finishing patching Arthur up - the injuries should heal in about a week or so"", he added before putting away the med kit.
"" Usually it takes me only 5 days more to heal from this "" Arthur said, admiring the skillful wrapping of the bandages around his torso. ' As expected of a military doctor ' he thought, wondering if he could master this given enough time. Maybe John could teach him?
""U- usually? "" John breathed, sad to know that this had been such a daily occurrence to Arthur that he would simply disclose it without a bat of an eye.
' But then why was he so insistent on not letting me check on him? Oh , of course subconscious reflexes ' John thought
"" I can stop spilling these details out if you feel uncomfortable, Mr John"", offered Arthur, noticing the sudden silence from John. It would be awkward to keep creating this tension between the two of them. Might lead to difficulties in their cohabitation.
John quickly declined the offer.
"" No, you don't have to, Arthur. It's okay. I was just-
"" Feeling sad about my condition? "" He inquired
"" Well yes - John trailed off, having trouble trying to find the right way to say - but I also admire how strong you are""
A look of confusion flashed onto Arthur's face.
"" How can a child like me be strong? --He said, tilting his head to the side and gesturing at John's shoulders-- I don't even want any defined muscles like you. I can barely lift anything more than 20 pounds "" 

John let out a light chuckle, sitting down on the sofa beside Arthur. 

"" Lad, strength isn't just about the physical kind, strength can be about how mentally resilient you are. The ability to go through something terrifying and still come out strong is admirable and not a trait that everyone has. ""

"" But I didn't come out strong. I came out unstable and illogical "" Arthur said, staring at his hands, remembering all his thoughts about how it would feel to strangle the people he hated( oh how he carved to see their faces twisted in anguish), namely his mother. 

"" Trauma can be a bitch,you aren't at fault for what happened to you. Anyone would be a bit messed up after what you have been through, of course it doesn't excuse any potential detestable actions in the future but you shouldn't be too harsh on yourself,lad. What's in the past is in the past. It's maybe hard to move on but don't worry, you'll have me alongside you--"" John said, pulling Arthur face to face with him--"" And you're not like him, Arthur. Just because you're his son biologically doesn't mean you're bound to grow up like him. --""

"" B-but--

"" No but, Arthur. You're not bad, lad. Hell, I think you're more compassionate than most kids I know. You risked getting hurt just to save a stray cat. You care about my feelings.These things aren't actions that Sherlock would have done when he was alive. Believe me when I say you are not like him. And don't worry if you feel more comfortable calling him ""sperm donor "". After all he isn't here anymore to hear it "" He added, guessing that Arthur probably felt more better if he could feel a sense of dissociation when it came to his relation to Sherlock. He didn't blame him. Even he himself didn't think Sherlock would have been a good parent, especially in his druggie years. The man after all had seen all sentiments and emotions to be beneath him, scoffing at the sheer sight of anyone catching any hope of forming a bond with him. John's heart cracked a little more at that fact (? ) but he would rather face the truth as soon as possible and get this over. Right now someone needed him. 

"" B-but you love him, don't you? Why would you bear my disrespecting him? ""

"" It's complicated. Arthur. I will tell you another day when I am ready "" John let out a sad smile. 

Despite feeling a bit impatient  , Arthur knew not to press forward on the matter. He knew what it feels like for someone to keep pressuring you to tell things you're not comfortable telling. It's a weight is on your chest and your ears are ringing with sound of "" Tell me! Tell me! You're being difficult. Why are you so dramatic? "".The ringing won't stop no matter how hard you try,it won't cease until you break down crying and they accuse you of being emotional and then laugh at you or accuse you of being the one who is mean when you decide enough is enough and lash out. 

' Thankfully that took place outside of school. I can't risk my record being tainted ' Arthur thought, vividly remembering how much he yearned to tackled those kids to the ground and sink his knife into them.

' But then did them really deserve that? ' he thought again, knowing fully well those kids hadn't known any better. Not like everyone had endured traumas and forced to mature quickly like him. Nonetheless the thoughts still persisted, filling his head with increasingly dark ideas, whenever they were about ending his or others' life. 

Returning to reality, Arthur asked "" But you will tell me one day right, Mr John? "" , to be on the safe side. He needed all the information to validate his feelings and to distinguish which were his trauma-induced ones and which were not. 

"" Of course, lad. You have the right to know who he was. But maybe not now, it can be a lot to take in. How about we talk about something else for now? ""

John really didn't know if he was saying that for Arthur's sake or his. Maybe both? 

"" Can you teach me how to bandage wounds? It would be a useful skill later on in my life "" Arthur requested. He had always been interested in the medical field. There are simply so much usefulness in knowing these knowledge. He couldn't comprehend why more people didn't care to learn more about medicine. The information could save their lives one day. 

"" Of course, lad "" John smiled, grabbing a roll of elastic bandage. 

"" Now put your hand forward. The first lesson will be about the basic first : how to bandage an injured hand. I will make an example and then you try to replicate it , okay? ""

"" Okay, Mr John ""

The first time wasn't prefect, like at all. And Arthur was a bit disappointed ( am I that incompetent? ) .

""It's okay, Arthur. First time is never the charm. It's okay to make mistakes. Let's try again "" John reassures him, unrolling the clumsy bandage from his own hand. In spite of that, the boy's expression was still a bit sour 

"" I will let you in on a secret lad. When I first tried to learn how to bandage, I accidentally bandaged my hand so tight that I couldn't get it to unwrap for nearly half an hour. ""

"" Really? ""

"" Yep, I nearly tripped myself trying to unwrap it in a hurry""

A muffled huff could be heard from Arthur. John reconsidered this a mission accomplished. 

"" Okay, now, let's get going with our lesson. Time doesn't wait for anyone"" He said, ruffling Arthur's blonde hair. "" Remember to pull just tight enough and make sure the bandage is secured -....... 

The next morning, Lestrade decided that it was time to pay a visit. 

"" Oh hello Lestrade "" John greeted

"" Just call me Greg, John. I am not on duty right now "", Greg said, entering the flat and turning his head around

"" He's fine, mate "" John replied, noticing his friend's actions. 

"" O-oh yeah, thanks, I was just-  ""

"" Worried? Shocked? Yeah I know, not everyday you discover that a sociopathic consulting detective has a lovechild. "" John said, putting the kettle on the stove. He needed his morning cup of tea. "" Honestly Greg,I wouldn't have thought that just because of his appearance that you would urged a bloody DNA test. "" 

Greg made an offended face

"" John, the kid literally walked into a crime scene guarded by official police officers and managed to sneak in without anyone noticing. Not only did he not get traumatized but he even stared at the corpses in fascination. And he even made a damn deduction. How was I supposed to NOT make a connection? --

"" True "", John said amusingly, pouring hot water into his mug of tea "" Would you like a cuppa too, Greg? ""

"" Yes, thank you -- But seriously when Arthur showed up out of nowhere, I nearly got a heart attack. I think that it was one of my crazy ideas. But when the result came --

"" Yeah I know, Greg, not everyday we discover that the late only consulting detective in the world has a lovechild ""

"" I know that he was low during those years but I never thought that he would do something this reckless. Oh bloody hell eleven years, John. Do you know how that can affect a child? ""

John nodded, having read a good deal of psychology books during his medical student years. He still did now. 

"" But he's strong, Greg. With enough help, I am sure he can overcome this""

' Unlike me '

"" If you think so, John. You're the one with good judgement "" Greg sighed. 

' I don't think so considering how I trusted Sherlock ' John thought sadly, remembering all the time he should have just given up on ever confessing his feelings, killed them off and thrown them off a river to rot into nothing. It would hurt but at least it wouldn't be as slow and agonizing as this. 

Catching a glimpse of his deranged replication of Sherlock, in his trench coat and suit,John turned his head away and shut his eyes but not before he saw the vision mouth"" I love you, John "" 

When he opened them, the vision was gone. 

' At least this time, the vision isn't such a dick.'

"" You okay, John? "" Greg asked 

""Yeah, just haven't woken from sleep yet. I have been sleeping on the sofa for the time being. Maybe I will move into Sherlock's room after this. My back have been killing me.""

Greg 's face turned into a sympathetic one. 

"" John, this must be hard for you, with no doubt. I, just, hope you will get better soon. In the meantime, I don't think it's time to rush anything "" 

"" Really? A currently sleep-deprived detective with blood shot eyes and a hair messy enough to rival a crow's nest is giving me advice on being healthy? "" John teased

"" Oi you arse, I just have too much cases on my plate these days. After this, I will probably sleep for a whole weekend "" 

"" Sleeping too much can cause harm, Greg ""

"" Whatever, doctor ""

"" Mr Lestrade "" 

It was not an exaggeration to say that Greg nearly jumped off the floor two feet from where he stood. 

"" Jesse Chris, Arthur. You scared me there ""the inspector said, wondering how the hell could a child move so quietly without making a sound. But then he did have Sherlock's genes 

""Sorry,i didn't mean to ""

' Well he is more polite than Sherlock '

"" It's okay,kid.Anyway what do you want to ask?"" ""How was the result of the case, Mr Lestrade? ""

"" Well you were right, Arthur, although we did find out that the attacker had actually planned this out beforehand. Too bad it didn't work according to plan for the bloke ""

"" But i was still right 90% , right? ""

"" Give or take, kid ""

"" YES "" Arthur said excitedly, doing a little happy dance of his own, which just involved tapping his feet on the floor to a make-up rhythm

She plants it on your lips and steps back as you both break out into giggles.

            'I want to kiss John too!' you hear a voice cry, and you turn and see that it's Simon, his lip trembling and his eyes watering. Bethany rolls her eyes at the sight and you laugh louder before grabbing his hand, small but still bigger than yours, and pull him close.

'Here, Simon,' you say as you place a kiss on his trembling lips, watching as Simon's eyes and smile grow wide and Bethany's giggles grow shrill, her plaits swinging as she doubles over.

The bubble of childhood innocence bursts as you feel a hand - much, much bigger than your own this time - grasping your arm, pulling you from your reverie. Bethany quiets instantly, and the tears reappear in Simon's eyes.

You spend the next hour in the headmaster's office, his droning voice teaching you what's appropriate for a young man to do. You're not a young man, you think, you're five, but you say nothing until your dad arrives to pick you up. His blue eyes are cold, and you make sure you stay quiet.

Tears well over as your dad shouts himself hoarse on the car ride home and he gets even louder when he spots them trailing down your cheeks. You're disgusting, he says, a shameful poof, and where did he go wrong in life to have a pansy son? You don't know what these words mean yet, not really, but you will soon and you can feel an anger settling in under your skin, a vibrating mess that you itch to let out.

The next day at school you push Simon to the floor when he asks you to play, and you look the other way when you see his expression of betrayal, heartbroken.

You wish it were yesterday, when you were both laughing so hard your ribs ached.

 

You're eighteen years old and holding your acceptance letter into King's College whilst trying to ignore the way Harry's shouting is getting louder and higher, the way it does when she's truly distressed. The paper is thick between your fingers, probably the best quality paper you've ever touched, and you brush your fingers over where your name is printed. Mr John Watson.

            You're going to turn that Mr into Dr even if it kills you.

            Harry's boots stomp down the stairs for the last time in this house and you wince as the front door slams against its hinges, your dad swinging it back open and shouting at Harry in the street. You put the letter on the bed and move to the window, shifting the drab net curtains to the side. Harry spots you and aims a quick, watery smile up at the window before slinging her stuffed rucksack over her shoulder and running to the car where her friend Emma is waiting. (You know they're more than friends, but you can't find the words to use for the way Harry's cocky grin turns shy when she talks about her, and your heart jumps into your throat when you go to ask. It's only later that it becomes easier to call them girlfriends, and it only happens when you've moved into dorms.)

            'Bye, Harry,' you say to the banged-up Ford as Harry pulls the door shut.

            Your dad stays in the street, still shouting, until the car squeals out of the street, and you find yourself mirroring his squared shoulders and clenched fists and feel bile rise to the back of your throat. It's good Harry got out and it's about time somebody did, but you can't help but feel a little betrayed that she left you here with him. You turn and your gaze falls to the letter on the bed, the back type and cream paper stark against the greying sheets.

You won't be here for much longer, and you won't be coming back.

 

At twenty-five, the roiling pot of anger inside you has quieted to a simmer, too exhausted from ward placements and essays to feel anything other than a fatigue that's only kept from consuming you by a steady buzz of caffeine, thanks to the tea you drink.

            Your uni mates have already begun their plans to move cross-country, to their hometowns where they'll be pediatricians 'til they retire. You'll miss them, of course you will, but it's easier to breathe now you're getting closer to a time where you don't have to meticulously plan bathroom trips. You've done your best to avoid bumping into half-naked housemates in the hallway, their hair still dripping and towels slung low over angular hips, but it's getting harder to ignore the way your mouth goes dry when you laugh it off with them.

            You're not gay. A steady stream of girlfriends over the years has confirmed to you that, yes - you still like women. A lot. Your mind drifts back to memories of Siobhan's soft curves and small-but-wicked hands sometimes when you're in the hospital break room and your brain actually has a chance to slow down and think, and Kathy had been a good girlfriend for the three months that you went out. (It was the longest relationship you've had, but your head wasn't in it. It's been too busy with work and ignoring slurred voicemails from Harry.) So you don't understand why that can't be enough for you.

            You don't understand why you can't just be normal.

            Running through the corridors of the hospital keeps the questioning at bay, keeps it under the skin where it's happy to lie quiet, but you dread the day that your studies are over and you have to face the real world. There's no way you're following in your mates' footsteps, you'd rather gnaw off your leg than go home, but with no girlfriend and no specialty lined up - though you're good at emergency surgery, very good, with the steadiest hand that the rest of your placement envies - you're not sure what you want to do with the rest of your life. You've made something of yourself, and that's all you've ever wanted to prove, but there's no plan there.

            Which is why when the Army asks, you say yes, and you fall into the rush of St Bart's and eventually, Afghanistan.

            That's where it falls apart.

 

You're thirty-fucking-five and you can't keep still. The Foxhound's engine rumbles as you cross the desert, swaying in your seat as you ride over divots and craters in the dry earth. Some are probably natural formations. Others, you know, are all that remain of days and nights of endless bombings.

The squad sat with you in the back are your family now - good men and women that you stitch up and send off running again with a clap on the shoulder. You squint through the sunlight to look at Peter sat opposite to you, his legs wide and exuding confidence and familiarity. He looks at you and raises an eyebrow, smirking, and you lick your lips before looking to the horizon. It's not a good idea. But it's an idea, and you know that it's not just your own. You can feel the weight of his gaze lingering on your mouth before he turns to joke with Jackie. It's her you should fancy, she's all steel eyes and take-no-shit attitude, but there's something about Peter's chestnut skin deepening even more under the excruciatingly dry sun, stretching over his strong arms and lightening the hair there that you want.

'Heads up, check-point ahead,' Rocky says from the driver's seat through the hatch. You turn round to the window and see the weathered building no bigger than a shed and your hands clench in your lap, expectant. It's a familiar feeling nowadays, channeling the adrenaline your temper gifts you. It's - good. You think. It is what it is, anyway.

'Anybody want anything from the drive-thru?' Peter jokes with a grin, and Jackie punches his bicep whilst rolling her eyes, but her lips are twisting up reluctantly and so are yours.

You know something's wrong when there's a moment that's just too quiet, too still, and then your suspicions are confirmed when the car overturns.

Blood blurs your vision and there's a ringing in your ears that won't stop when you shout, 'Everyone okay?!'

You think you shout it, anyway, but you can't hear yourself nor anything else for that matter. You unbuckle your seatbelt with trembling hands and grunt when you slump upside down against the roof of the patrol car. Wiping the blood away from your eyes and quickly feeling for injury - it's superficial, a graze or split skin that's bleeding loads because that's what heads do - and you scan over the squad. Jackie's out cold but you can feel her pulse thrumming under the thin skin of her wrist when you reach over, Peter and Rocky are - God. Oh, God. The metal of the car is crumpled around them, half of Peter's head caved in like a deflated football.

You swallow the sick that fills your mouth back down, choking on it for a moment, and move to carefully unclip Jackie's seatbelt before the Foxhound's engine decides to explode. Her lean body slumps against you as you try to kick the back door open but your leg is weak, too weak, but the other one kicks fine when you try it and the doors fly open, the left half falling off its hinges as you move to drag Jackie out.

Your skin is thrumming and your ears are ringing and you barely even feel the bullet when it rips through your shoulder, sending you flying into the sand besides Jackie's unconscious body as you beg, 'Please, God, let me live.'

 

You're thirty-six, chasing a mad genius across London on the daily and you know that you're screwed.

            Life with Sherlock is... consuming. He's mental, and amazing, rude but sometimes sweet and an absolute cock at times. You can't get enough of him and it terrifies you. You were lost from the moment you laid eyes on him, his dark curls farming frankly ridiculous cheekbones and a voice like heavy velvet. It was exhilarating; he was exhilarating, with just a hint of danger that you could feel pulling you in, magnetic.

            The high you get from solving a case with him electrifies you, hums in your fingertips that ache to pull him down into you as he stands beside you (too close, he's always too close god you wish he'd never move) and your chests heave as your eyes meet, and you know you aren't imagining that there's something there begging to happen.

            It's familiar though, too, and your mind flicks images of Simon and Peter behind your eyelids, and you move away eventually because Sherlock never moves first. You wish he would, just once, but then again you aren't sure whether you'd want him to lean in or look away.

            You're not gay, though, and you prove it by dating a string of women that you can't remember the details of and fucking away the image of Sherlock's wiry frame spread out across sheets. No girlfriend deserves to be strung along by a man who doesn't know what he wants, though, so you give it up eventually and try not to wallow in the guilt.

At this point it's just instinct to deny it.

'I'm not actually gay,' you say to the woman, Irene, before she blows your mind.

'Well I am,' she says, smirking at your confusion, 'look at us both.'

And that's when it hits you that other people feel the same way you do, that you're allowed to want men whilst liking women, too. (You'd heard of bisexuality before, obviously, but that had been - background information. You'd never actually seen it in practice, never met somebody who feels the same way you do.) Of course it's The Woman that tells you this, and of course it's her that Sherlock actually wants.

Your fists clenches at your side, pushing down the tremor, and Irene looks at you in that 'I-see-everything' way that her and Sherlock do and she smiles in delight at getting a reaction out of you. You curse when you hear Sherlock's customised text-tone and Irene just smiles wider.

She dies and you can't fully quash the evil, jealous relief that swells inside.

Sherlock dies and you feel nothing again.

 

You're thirty-eight when Mary picks you up, dusts you off and makes you feel something closer to alive again. She's quick as a whip, though, and you predict the question before it comes.

            'So,' she starts, swirling wine in her glass as she leans over the table towards you, and the buzzing under your skin starts up, 'you and Sherlock. Were you...?'

            Mary lets the question hang, and you could deny it easily. She's giving you an easy out, but you owe it to her not to take it.

            'No, we weren't,' you say, taking a sip from your water glass that's shaking slightly in your hand.

            'But you wanted to,' she says, and it's then that you get the idea to marry her. Mary is beautiful, truly, her wide eyes glittering in the candlelight and her mouth stretched into a small but kind smile, and you take a moment to appreciate her before you speak.

            'Yes,' you admit, and it comes out breathy, punched out of you by the force of admitting something that you had pushed down for so long. You expect her to down the wine and leave the table to never return, but she doesn't. She puts down her glass and puts her hand over yours, resting them both on the table together.

            You pay the bill when it arrives and the next day you buy the ring.

            Then Sherlock keeps a promise you asked for at his grave and turns your world upside-down, in the way that only he can manage.

            You fight with yourself through the next year: through the traumatic reappearance of Sherlock, acting for all the world like he hadn't ripped your soul in two when he left. Through your wedding, sat between the two people that love you most and whom you aren't sure you love more. Through the discovery that Mary wasn't as perfect as you had imagined - she was more. Just like Sherlock was more.

Mary, though, gives you Rosie, who actually is perfect, and through the terror you swear to her that you'd be the father you wish you'd had.

You grit your teeth through it all and act like you aren't being pulled apart.

 

Pushing forty already feels like hell, your knees clicking when you move too quickly and your head throbbing the day after you have a single beer, but it feels even worse when Mary dies and the vibrating, simmering anger is let loose.

            You don't mean to aim it at Sherlock but it's so easy because none of this would have happened if he'd just done something, if he'd just taken you when you were available and wanting him so badly you ached with it.

            You still want him. You just want to hurt him too, and although it's not fair you can't control it.

            Punches are thrown and venomous words are spat out at the broken man you've loved since you met him, and you're so like your dad in that moment that it's only the thought of him being proud of you that slows your next punch. Rosie deserves somebody who is nothing like your dad was.

            So you get on with doing what's expected of you, like you always have. You save Sherlock's life because he's busy saving yours and you help him pull himself back together like the sight of him doesn't wake you want to scream what-ifs, like what if you'd kissed him that first night, or any of the other ones that you wanted to? What if you carried on limping away when Mike Stamford called your name?

            Instead, you confess your sins to Sherlock and let him hold you when the tears spring to your eyes. You duck your head down and away because dad had hated when you cried so much, but he just pulls you closer and you hate that you wish you were closer still.

            'It is what it is,' Sherlock says, softly. He's shaking from the withdrawal and you want to soothe, help or scream but he just strokes a hand over your hair and guides you through the breakdown that's been waiting almost forty years to happen.

            With each shuddering breath, you let yourself be the hurt one. You mourn Mary and the life she'd given you. You mourn the boy you never really got to be. You mourn for close to fifteen minutes, swaying with Sherlock on the worn carpet of 221B.

            'I have to get back to Rosie,' you say, your voice cracking somewhere in the middle.

            'Of course,' Sherlock says, but he doesn't let go instantly, his arms cradled around you for a lingering moment, 'Give her my love.'

            Your smile feels close to genuine when you look up into his open expression. 'I will.'

           

You're forty now. Forty today, in fact, and it feels - good.

            You smother Rosie with kisses throughout the day, basking in her gorgeous giggles and sass that no baby should ever have mastered (thanks, Mary's genes), before making the trip downstairs and dropping her into Mrs Hudson's arms for the evening.

            'You have a good birthday bash, John,' she says, winking and smiling more than she ever used to when you were dropping Rosie at her or Molly's door every day just to cope.

            'I plan to, Mrs Hudson,' you say, grinning at her laughter and placing one last kiss on Rosie's brow.

            You take the stairs back upstairs two at a time, eager to get into the living room where your friends are waiting. Lestrade is on the couch, telling a story of a difficult drugs bust and gesturing wildly at Sherlock, who is smirking at him and probably deduced where the drugs were hidden thirty seconds into the tirade. Lestrade gets up when he spots you at the door, cutting himself off and giving you a very-special-birthday-handshake.

            'Forty, mate,' Lestrade jokingly winces, and he pulls his hand back when you start to twist it round, laughing.

            'I've felt forty for a decade, it can't get much worse,' you say, before Molly walks into the room behind you and hands you a very lovely card.

            Sherlock passes you a beer, his fingers brushing yours as it's handed over, but you don't wince away from it this time. You thank him and look him in the eyes as he watches you take a long swig, before turning to greet Molly.

            There's cake at some point, supplied by Tesco's finest, and you blow the forty candles (Sherlock insisted on counting and placing them himself) out as quickly as you can lest the fire alarm goes off. You have three cold beers and by the time Lestrade and Molly leave you're sinking into your armchair comfortably.

            Sherlock is stood at the window, violin in hand but not playing, and you study the lines of his tall body, dressed in a fine maroon shirt and those damned black trousers.

            'You've decided, then,' he says suddenly, turning around to look at you, and you blink up at him.

            'Sorry?' You ask, but the tips of your fingers are beginning to tingle with what could be excitement.

            Sherlock moves over slowly, and you realise that he's completely sober. Thinking back on the night, you're not sure you ever saw him with a drink in his hand.

            'What you are,' Sherlock explains - and although you probably shouldn't, you know exactly what he's referring to. You swallow dryly before standing up from your armchair, facing him.

            'I'm bi,' you say, and you're proud of the way your voice only slightly wavers when you can practically hear your heart thundering in your ears.

            'Good,' Sherlock says, and you have a moment of confusion before you notice how close you're standing together, breathing the same air between you.

            He's waiting, you think, and you push up on the balls of your feet to press a kiss to his mouth. Sherlock presses back, and the hum beneath your skin falls silent.","['KayB90', 'Calais_Reno', 'sandra42', 'johnnyboyy', 'Mmarika', 'Moon_Ainsworth', 'orianamaia', 'RoseMartial', 'wwubd', 'Daybora', 'veowens', 'LHR_etc', 'Dee_Laundry', 'MargueriteSomebodyoranother', 'actualtrashrat', 'RuthRaven13', 'MehOolongTea']","['Nickkirk', 'orianamaia']"

I need you to tell me what do you think.' Sherlock's voice was coming from the bathroom, so John sighted and stand up.'Oh' he whispered in horror. Sherlock was standing there with his face covered in blood. The left eye was red with brow bleeding. The worst was the cut on his cheekbone - quite deep and about five centimeters long from his eye to the ear. 'What the hell happened?' John stepped into the bathroom stopped in shock.'I wanted to consult this cut with you. I suspect it needs stitches, but I believe I shouldn't do it myself.''Yeah, but Sherlock... what have you done? It's 9 AM, Saturday morning?!' John said while pulling out his emergency kit.'I told you I am going out.' He murmured and sat on the stool to make it easier for John to examine his injuries.'I thought you were going out to the store! Oh my god... Sherlock, you are so lucky. You might have lost your eye!''I didn't. I had everything under control.''Oh, Sherlock. I am so much worried about you.' John sighed but started to disinfecting the area. After few minutes everything was alright. Well, as much as it can be when your best and only friend shows up bleeding on, what was supposed to be, a peaceful Sunday morning. 'Is that the only one?''Yeah, no more cuts.' Sherlock said and stand up, holding his stomach.'Why are you holding your hand like that?''It's nothing serious, John.''Oh come on, Sherlock! You need to tell me if you were hurt. Come on, take off your shirt.' He said frustrated. 'Now!' He added after seeing hesitation from his friend.Suddenly the doorbell rang. Sherlock wanted to answer the door to leave the uncomfortable situation, but John stopped him. 'Not now, we are busy. However, it is will wait.'Sherlock sighed and unbuttoned his shirt. His stomach was bruised, but there were no cuts. John touched the stomach in multiple places. Everything seemed fine, but...'What are those?' Said John pointing kinesiology tapes covering his pectoral muscles.Before Sherlock could answer they heard someone unlocking the door.'I saw the footage and wanted to check on you... brother mine' Mycroft finished his sentence slowly trying to judge what is happening. You see... John sleeps only with boxers on...'I'm fine. We can talk in the living room.' Sherlock uttered and stormed out of the bathroom living John with his question unanswered.John sighed and started cleaning the bathroom. It took some time until he dressed up and was ready to join Holmes brothers.'Are you sure?' Mycroft sounded more worried than usual 'I don't want to mess with your choices, but... I want you to be safe.''Oh, fuck of. I've lived with him for three years. I know him.''Alright. I am going home, but John seems to be waiting behind the door. Come in!' John blushed and come in. Sherlock was sitting on the sofa with his shirt already buttoned up. 'Remember I am always there for you. Call me anytime brother mine.''I am sorry, I wasn't...' John started, but Mycroft already left.'It's okay John, sit down.' Sherlock said and smiled sadly. 'Mycroft insists on telling you something. Well, maybe also it was the situation we were a few minutes ago.''Is something wrong?' At this point, John was seriously worried.'No, nothing's wrong. I just have a... statement to make, a coming out one may say... I am transgender. John, do you know what this means?' Sherlock looked at John who opened his eyes wider.'What?''Transgender means that my masculinity is an effect of my own efforts, not the by-product of socialization. In other words - I am the one who created myself. From the basics as my name to the rest. Of course, it's all based on observation of others, but I like to say I made myself on my own.' Sherlock smiled mischievously.'Yeah, sorry. I know what transgender meant... but umm okay. I am a bit surprised.' John was struggling to speak. 'Of course, I don't have a problem with transsexuals...''Transgender, transgender people' Sherlock corrected him automatically. 'Please continue.''Thanks, I don't have a problem with transgender people, I just wasn't suspecting that. Umm so... what does it mean in terms of our relationship? How should I refer to you?' Sherlock saw John's struggle to be polite and laughed.'Sherlock. You should refer to me as Sherlock - that's my name. I also use he/him pronouns just I have before this conversation.''Yeah, right.' John nodded and suddenly his eyes opened wider, he looked at Sherlock's shirt and blushed.'Yes, the tape is covering my breasts, John.' Sherlock answered the unasked question 'If you have anything else to ask now is a good time.''Umm... Why... Umm... What was Mycroft doing here?' He blurted after a while'Oh, he saw me beaten up on his monitoring system and wanted to check if you took care of me. He is overprotective, but has good intentions.' Sherlock paused for a moment. 'Well, I need to check again where he has cameras. Anyway, do you have any other questions? Perhaps about me being transgender?''No, I don't... well can I really ask something?' Sherlock nodded 'Why do you have breasts?'Sherlock chuckled. 'My dear Watson... When you turn fourteen, sometimes even at ten or twelve your body starts to change... It can be confusing, but you as a doctor should know that.''Yeah sorry, this question was inappropriate.' Sherlock nodded and stand up to look out the window.'I'll go to my room. Call me if you need me.' John left the room and Sherlock picked up his violin.He played slow, but rather joyful music, so John concluded that he wasn't mad about the question. 'That's good' John thought. Maybe he should have known it wasn't his place to assume that Sherlock wants to have his breasts removed. He sighed. It was a bit too much for him. Of course, he was a doctor, but he went to military school, so no one there mentioned transgender people. He opened his computer and tried to google some information.***'Is he fine?' The voice from the bedroom asked'Yeah, and he came out to John.' Mycroft entered the room to see his partner sitting in bed.'Wow, that's big. And how has John reacted?' 'I wasn't there, but he texted me it was fine.''I'm sure he would call you if he had any problem.' He put his laptop away to make room 'I hope so, darling. I hope so.' Mycroft said sadly and lied on the bed putting his head on his partner's lap. Greg smiled and kissed Mycroft's forehead.'I'm sure he would.'

Enjoy John's identity crisises :)

'John? Are you there?' Only after the question, John realized that Sherlock has been knocking on the door for a few minutes.
'Huh? Yeah,' He yawned and stands up to open the door. 'Good morning' He said and walked back to bed.
'Do you want scrambled eggs?' Sherlock asked looking through his phone
'You wake me up to ask me that?'
'Yes. If I have waited until you get up, the eggs would have been cold.' Sherlock said as if this was a legitimate reason to wake someone.
'But... yeah, I want eggs.'
'Great, they are in the kitchen. I'm going to Molly, don't wait with the dinner.'
'What? You are not...' John didn't even have time to finish his question because Sherlock has already left. 'Okay. It looks like I'll eat alone.' He said to himself and help himself with the meal.
It must have been some sort of experiment because Sherlock prepared two dozens of eggs. To John's disappointment, there was no evidence of Sherlock actually eating any of it. Obviously, he was used to the eating habits of his friend, but he still was worried when he was noticing a lack of appetite for a longer period of time. John didn't know how to help his friend. The only thing he was sure of was the fact that any kind of therapist is of the limits with Holmes.
Some people (like Lestrade) have been telling John, that he shouldn't worry about it. It's not his job, and Sherlock is an adult. He knew that, but it didn't change anything.
John felt responsible for his flatmate, they lived together for a couple of years, they spend most of their free time together. Even when John was alone, he mostly thought about Sherlock. God, he even had a blog about his friend. Yeah, after some reflection it did seemed a bit odd. However, who isn't odd? John was used to the tightness of their relationship. Sherlock meant everything to him. But... he had to admit - there were some things he missed. For example the lack of physical intimacy. It's not like Sherlock told him not to date anyone. They haven't even talked about it. Well... maybe they did in the beginning, but that was a mistake. John even went on a couple of dates, but every time he felt like he would rather spend time with Sherlock. At one point he even started to question his sexuality. Maybe he is just gay? It sounded logical - a straight man should think about his male - friend during kissing a girl. He tried dating guys, but it didn't help either. He definitely was attracted to them, but still... they weren't Sherlock. So he stopped dating at all. But that... felt lonely. He spent a lot of time with Sherlock, he met his brother. They lived together... Everyone used to suspect they are dating... they didn't.
To be fair, it was something that John was thinking about often... Maybe he should date Sherlock? Maybe his other relationships were doomed to failure because he has been in love with Sherlock from the very beginning.
Somehow, he didn't feel it's a good idea. What if Sherlock doesn't want to be in that kind of relationship with him? John knew Sherlock is gay - they've talked about it once, when they were discussing a movie, they've watched together. Sherlock said the character's portrayal was stereotypical and unfair. John was surprised Sherlock cared about that, so the younger Holmes told him that he is in fact gay and he even tried activism when he was in college.
So if Sherlock was gay and a genius he definitely knew that John liked him... like that. And if that's the case John should accept this rejection.
However... there were days when John still was dreaming about them together. When days like that came he was rethinking everything again. Maybe he should try? After all Sherlock was always very nice to him, and he wasn't nice to anybody (at least no without any intentions).
'Oh, fuck it! I'll ask him today!' John screamed and blushed. Vocalizing his thought wasn't intentional.
'Who will you ask what?' Sherlock asked and John jumped in his seat. He hasn't realized he wasn't alone anymore.
'How long have you been here?!'
'About ten minutes' Sherlock said scanning John with his eyes. 'I thought it's not a problem I spend time in my apartment.'
'No, sorry. I just thought you said you would come back late.'
'My plans changed. I haven't realized Molly's boss has cameras. He saw me setting a corpse on fire and called security.'
'You did what?'
'Oh come on, John. Don't look surprised. I had everything under control.' He shook his head. 'What do you wanted to tell me?'
'How do you know it was...' John didn't finish his sentence as Sherlock raised his eyebrow. 'Yeah, nothing... I just wanted to ask you how are your injuries healing.'
'They are fine, John. But I know you are lying.' He looked on John in silence and sighted. 'Well, if you don't want to tell me I'm going to go rest in my room.' Sherlock walked out of the room.
'Stop! I wanted to ask if you want go with me to Mike's party.' John blurted the words before he could stop himself.
'Yeah, sure. When should we leave?'
'About nine o clock.'
'So we have eight hours... Okay.'
Sherlock left Watson in shock. He wasn't ready for this. Did he just ask Sherlock on a date? No, of course not, it's just a party. But what does Sherlock thinks. They really need to talk about... all of this.

Let's make things clear. John was nervous. Extremely nervous. He just asked Sherlock out on a date. How did he do that? Why? He hadn't planned it. It just... happened. Well, maybe that's how life works. Maybe it just happens. John wasn't satisfied with that explanation, he was pacing in front of his mirror checking how his hair looks. It was fine. Same as the shirt he decided to wear. Unfortunately, John wasn't comforted by these facts. Not when Sherlock wasn't there. To be fair it was only five past nine, so it was not a big deal at all. Also, it's not like there is a fixed time when everyone shows up. Even if they came an hour later than the rest nothing would happen. John knew all of that. Deep down he knew, that it isn't the party he is worried about. He was worried about what can happen afterward. He planned that he would tell Sherlock what he feels in the cab on the way back. That sounded logical. They will sit together for a set amount of time, so Sherlock would have to listen. And if it goes wrong he can just say he is sleepy and go to his room avoiding any awkward conversations.John knew the plan was good, he was just worried.'John?' Sherlock shouted through the door 'Sorry I'm late, I only need a minute and we can leave.' Sherlock left in the bathroom before John could answer. In a few minutes, they were sitting in a cab.'Who is Mike?' asked Sherlock'Who?' John was repeating what he wanted to say and wasn't paying attention.'Mike. The one who invited you to the party we are currently going to.' 'Oh, he is a friend from work. We don't talk much, but I guess he likes me. I help him a lot. He is two years older than me and has a wife - Vanessa. I don't know if she'll be there, she is also a doctor, but works in a different hospital.'Sherlock nodded. The rest of the ride they spent in silence.

'Hi! I am happy you came!' The tall man shouted to out-yell loud music. 'Who are you with?' He asked pointing at Sherlock.'It's my friend! Sherlock!' John answer. 'Here! That's for you!'Cool! Thanks' Mike said as he received the gift. 'Almost everyone's here!''I see!' John nodded and looked at the crowd. There were about thirty people in the room. He recognized about a third of them. People were dancing. It was a nice place, but the music was definitely too loud, John also didn't like the fact that people were smoking inside. He hated the smell. Secretly, he was also afraid of them. He was worried someone may get burned. It wasn't an irrational fear. It happens once to him when he was in college. He was at the party and a girl he was making out with setting his jacket on fire. Fortunately, he realized something it's wrong and took it off quickly, but the fear stayed. He shook his head and decided to get a drink from him and for Sherlock.Holding to glasses of beer, he tried to find his friend in the crowd. He found him looking uncomfortable, talking to a stranger in the quieter area. He approached them in the middle of the conversation.'Here's a beer for you.' He handed a drink to Sherlock. 'Hi! My name is John. I know Mike from work.' He smiled at the man.'I'm Steven. I studied with Mike.' The man responded and continued. 'I was telling your friend why gay couples shouldn't adopt children. You see. I'm a psychiatrist and I work with children. I'd know.''Ohh...' John was struck by this answer'Can you imagine, this guy disagrees with me?' John could imagine that.'Yeah, well I heard Mike was looking for you.' 'Really?''I've just talked to him. He was over there.' John pointed to the furthest corner of the local.'Thanks, man.' Steve said and wobbled through the room.'Are you ok?' John asked and touched Sherlock's arm'I'm fine, John. I didn't need a rescue. I would be fine.' John noticed a hint of annoyance in his voice, but overall Sherlock seemed relieved.'I'm sure you would. I just didn't want him to ruin our evening.' He smiled softly. 'Do you want to have some shots?''We just... sure, why not.' Sherlock agreed and they began their journey to the bar. It seemed that right now there were much more people than before, so already crowded room became very difficult to go through. They succeeded in their mission and happily drunk a couple of rounds. Later John has to go to the loo and when he came back Sherlock was nowhere to be found. After some time he finally found Sherlock. Surprisingly, once again he was talking with Steve. This time the man was even drunker. 'And that's just wrong!' He shouted. 'They want to have kids, but they put penises in their bottoms. But you know what's weird? I had a penis in my girlfriend's bottom. Can you imagine?!' He was speaking very loudly. Sherlock understandably uncomfortable was just standing there observing John's struggles to find his way through the crowd.'Hi John!' said Sherlock theatrically and make a step towards his friend. Then, before John could realize what's happening he kissed him on the lips. John, surprised, but happy, closed the space between there and embraced Sherlock in a tight hug. It could go longer, but suddenly they heard Steve vomiting, so they stepped back.'We should go back.' said John to Sherlock's ear, still holding him by his waist.'Yeah.' said Sherlock with satisfactionThey left the building, the streets were empty, there were few cars, but no cabs, so after some time they decided that they should start walking home.John gathered all of his courage and started. 'I wanted to talk to you about something.' 'I'm listening.''I wanted to ask you out, I... I'm not sure how you'd react, but... well I need to tell you this anyway. I was silent for too long. So...' John took a big breath and looked at Sherlock. The taller man was listening carefully. 'I think I am in love with you. Well, I'm sure I am. And I wanted to ask if you are too.'Sherlock smiled and pulled John closer to him. He looked him into the eyes, their faces were just as close as they can be without touching. 'Yes, I am.' He whispered and kissed him.John was struck. Was he waiting all those years feeling he should stop fantasizing about Sherlock just to learn he liked him back? The kiss ended and they continued to walk. This time holding hands.'I also wanted to say I'm sorry.''Oh?' This time Sherlock looked surprised'I mean when I asked you about your... chest. I shouldn't have. Sorry. I want you to know I respect you and I don't want to make you uncomfortable.' He wasn't looking into Sherlock's eyes. If he did, he would see Sherlock's smile.'It's okay, John. It just wasn't the best time. I wasn't prepared. And... it's not as easy as one may think. Especially cis dude like you. No offense.' He looked at John. 'I see you are trying to be the best you can, I appreciate that.'When they returned to their apartment Sherlock offered to make tea. John agreed, so here there were. In the kitchen, drinking tea, in the middle of the night. John noticed Sherlock's shaking a bit. He also felt cold, so he moved his chair so their legs can touch.Their cups were empty they still were sitting together. Talking about some childhood memories and stupid people. Before anyone realized Sherlock had his hand on John's tight. He wasn't doing anything, just gently stroking John's leg, slowly moving towards his groin, while keeping looking deep into John's eyes. 'Do you want to take off your pants?' Sherlock asked. John smiled and without any further hesitation pulled his jeans down and throw them on the floor. 'Let's go to the bedroom.' He offered. Without splitting apart they've managed to lay on the bed. 'Can I see you naked?' John asked but after seeing Sherlock's frown he added quickly 'Only if you want to, we don't...''Shush... It's fine. Just... remember I am a man.' Sherlock pulled down his pants as John unbuttoned his shirt, kissing his partner on the neck.'I love you.' John purred'I love you too' said Sherlock and went down on John's penis. John moaned as Sherlock licked the head of his erection. John kissed his partner and embraced him. Sherlock started to rub his tights on John's genitals. John reached Sherlock's crotch with his hand and started rubbing his clitoris. 'Is it all right?' He asked'Yeah, you can go inside.' Sherlock whispered and kissed his neck.'Lube?' John asked and, as Sherlock nodded, he reached to his nightstand for a bottle.

Ok, so I decided to flip perspectives, cause I got tired of John. (Sorry if you liked him.)


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Sherlock woke up sore. His head was pulsing; he felt nauseous and dizzy. Carefully he stands up and walked to the bathroom. After seeing his reflection in the mirror he decided to take a shower. He looked at his chest and shivered, but started to peel off his tapes. He turned on hot water. As the glue soaked it was easier but still painful. He washed his hair and naked walked out of the bathroom. He walked into his room and found some comfortable clothes. Tight, but a flexible tank top and a loose shirt. If he had to point one thing he hated more than stupid people he would say binders. They made his back hurt and his arms lose mobility, which was an awful prize for effects that could be achieved for less. He combed his wet hair and walked to the kitchen. He still felt sick, but a cup of tea made it a little bit better. When John woke up, Sherlock was writing responses for his clients. Some of their problems, 'mysteries' as they stupidly called them could be solved by text. Clients didn't appreciate the way Sherlock has been treating them, but who really cared. Sherlock wasn't doing it for money anyway.'Good morning, John.' He said without raising his eyes.'Hi' John answered with a big smile on his face. 'What are you up to?''Nothing, I've been just wondering...' Sherlock bit his lip. 'Do you remember yesterday?''Yeah, I do.' John smiled and blushed, but as Sherlock wasn't smiling he asked. 'Is something wrong?''No! It's great. I'm happy we did it, John.' Sherlock reassured his friend. 'But I wanted to talk about it. Yesterday we were drunk, but now... what are we going to do about it?''Well, what I've said wasn't fully spontaneous, so... if you want we can... continue?' He waited for Sherlock's reaction, but the other man remained silent. 'Sherlock? Are you sure everything's fine? Have I done something wrong?' 'No... You haven't done anything wrong, but... I feel we need to really talk about it. Like... how do you imagine dating me?' Sherlock avoided eye contact.'I mean... probably quite similar to how our friendship looks now, but with sex and kissing.' John's straightforward answer made Sherlock laugh.'I was asking about how do you imagine dating me since I am transgender, John.' He quickly returned to a serious tone.'Yeah... Well, I don't imagine it would cause any problems. I love you, Sherlock. I've loved you when I didn't know you're transgender and I love you now. But like... if you have something you want to clarify I am always ready for listening.'Sherlock stand up and kissed John softly.'Maybe later.' He wanted to hug, John, but the shorter man stepped back.Sherlock almost started to worry, but John kneeled down. 'Sherlock, will you be my boyfriend?' Sherlock laughed and kissed John's forehead. 'I will.'

Ok, so this is the last chapter of this story (for now, as I have an exam coming in few weeks). And... I hope you enjoyed it and you are not mad at me about where the end is. There are chances I publish a second part (if I do it'll be shown somewhere), but I'm quite happy how I closed my main point of the story.","['ch3rry9012', 'toujourspurr', 'Kaxlie', 'Julietneko', 'AlisonTramontin']",['Julietneko']

Slyszy ogien jeszcze zanim go zobaczy. Trzaski  i ryki wyglodnialej, nieludzkiej bestii. Odwraca sie i widzi, jak plomienie wija sie w rogu jego sypialni; jezyki plomieni siegaja miekkich zaslon, pozeraja tapete. Goraco kradnie mu oddech z pluc, przypala mu skore.



Podbiega do drzwi, chwyta klamke i przekreca ja, ale drzwi  sie nie ruszaja. Sa zablokowane. Jest uwieziony.



Teraz plonie jego lozko. Jego krzeslo. Jego pudelko z zabawkami i jego rysunki na scianie nad biurkiem. Dym wypelnia pokoj, krzyczy o pomoc, gdy zbliza sie plomien, a wokol niego zamyka sie ryk ognia.



 


Siada, gwaltownie lapiac powietrze i probujac uchwycic obrazy szybko rozpraszajace sie z powrotem w cieniu jego umyslu. Plynaca przez niego adrenalina sprawia, ze ma ochote wyskoczyc z lozka i biec, ale czuje sie tak, jakby przebiegl juz bardzo wiele kilometrow. Mruga w ciemnosci, szukajac czegos znajomego, czegos co rozproszy jego dezorientacje, ale nigdy w zyciu nie widzial tego mieszkania.

Siedzi na lozku, z poscieli wydobywa sie mdly zapach wody kolonskiej, ktorego nie rozpoznaje. Potrafi w ciemnosci dostrzec maly aneks kuchenny i ksztalt fotela. To raczej nie jest hotel, ale zbyt za ciasno tu na salon. Chyba ... kawalerka?

Wierci sie, i czuje na przylegajacej do jego ciala koszuli ogromna, mokra plame po srodku klatki piersiowej, ktora zaczela juz zasychac na brzegach. Gleboki, ciemny szkarlat, niemal czarny w slabym swietle ksiezyca wpadajacym przez zakurzone zaluzje. Slyszy w uszach pulsujaca krew, gdy przyglada sie temu i przeszywa go dreszcz. Ostroznie odsuwa material z klatki piersiowej i brzucha, delikatnie przesuwajac palcami, kataloguje uwaznie swoje cialo, szukajac zrodla krwi. Jest jej tak wiele... jakby sie w niej kapal. Jest niejasno swiadomy, ze logicznie rzecz biorac powinien panikowac, ale jego umysl  jakby tonie we mgle.

Przesuwa sie powoli, czekajac, az pociagniecie rany spowoduje uderzenie pioruna przeszywajacego bolu; ale jedyne co go boli, to jego pulsujaca glowa i nie wydaje sie, aby to z niej krwawil.

Dracymi rekami klepie sie po kieszeniach, wyczuwajac z ulga ksztalt telefonu. Wyciagajac go, dzwoni do jedynej osoby, ktora chcialo mu sie zaprogramowac w kontaktach.

- Sherlock? - glos Johna jest ochryply od snu.

Sherlock odsuwa telefon i mruzy oczy; na ekranie jest 04:22.

- John  - zaczyna, ale oddech dlawi go w gardle. Teraz caly sie trzesie, dreszcz  przebiega przez jego cialo, saczy sie az do kosci. Jest mu tak strasznie zimno.

John natychmiast staje sie bardziej czujny. - Co sie stalo?

Jezyk Sherlocka jest sucha, niezdarna rzecza w jego ustach. - Ja... nie wiem...

Na drugim koncu linii jest ruch; slychac zamykajace sie drzwi.  Sherlock moze sobie wyobrazic Johna stojacego na podescie przed swoja sypialnia, aby nie zbudzic Rosie.

- Gdzie jestes? - pyta John. Teraz brzmi czujnie, a nawet naglaco.

- Sadze, ze jestem chyba ... w czyims mieszkaniu - odpowiada Sherlock, marszczac brwi wobec wlasnych niespojnych mysli.

Wstaje na slabe, trzesace sie nogi i podchodzi do malego biurka w rogu. Poczta jest rozrzucona na calej powierzchni blatu zrobionego z wyszczerbionej plyty wiorowej.

- W czyim mieszkaniu? - pyta John.

Jego szorstki, zatroskany glos wydaje sie byc tym, co wyprowadza Sherlocka z oparow jego zamglonego umyslu.

- W mieszkaniu Darrena Mathera - odpowiada mechanicznie Sherlock, odczytujac nazwisko z kopert. - W... Islington?

- Kim jest Darren Mather?

Sherlock jest pewien, ze nigdy wczesniej nie slyszal tego nazwiska. - Nie wiem.

- Sherlock, przerazasz mnie. Jestes tam sam?

Znowu sie rozglada, chociaz mala przestrzen nie mogla ukryc innej osoby.

- Tak, jestem sam. Wlasnie sie tu obudzilem -  bierze gleboki oddech. Czuje sie taki zdezorientowany, taki nierealny - Jest tu... sporo krwi. I ja ... ja jestem niemal caly w niej.

- Chryste, co sie stalo? Jestes ranny? Podaj mi adres, zadzwonie pod 999 ...!

- Nie, John ... ja... -  urywa, myslac z wysilkiem, lecz w umysl zaczyna wkradac sie panika. - Nie sadze, zeby to byla moja krew.

Cisza wisi miedzy nimi, zanim John glosno przelknie. - Podaj mi adres; juz jade.

 

          ***

 

Budynek jest ciemny i obskurny, w powietrzu unosi sie ciezki zapach plesni. Przypomina Johnowi budynek, w ktorym wynajmowal kawalerke w czasach przed Sherlockiem: stara farba odpadajaca ze scian, migoczace zielonkawe lampy w korytarzach, mrukliwi lokatorzy.

Johnowi zoladek sciska sie, gdy widzi, ze drzwi do mieszkania numer cztery sa uchylone. Wiele moglo sie wydarzyc w ciagu tych trzydziestu minut, jakie zajelo mu dotarcie na Islington z Baker Street. Czy Sherlock musial uciekac? A moze lokator wrocil?

Wyciaga reke, aby chwycic pistolet wetkniety za pasek dzinsow, poprawia mala torbe przewieszona przez ramie i powoli otwiera drzwi.

Przed switem pokoj oswietla przytlumione, szare swiatlo. To niewielka przestrzen: maly stolik z jednym krzeslem przy scianie w poblizu skromnie umeblowanej kuchni. Na niektorych haczykach na scianie wisza przypadkowe elementy garderoby, a do sciany przylega male, niechlujne pojedyncze lozko. Pusto.

- Sherlock?! -  John wola ostroznie, zanim zarejestruje jednostajny szum dochodzacy zza jedynych w tym pomieszczeniu drzwi. Prysznic jest w uzyciu.

Chowa bron, puka i wolno otwiera drzwi.

- Sherlock?

Potwierdzajacy pomruk, prawie zagluszony przez bulgoczaca wode.

- Moge wejsc?

Znowu pomruk, ktory niejasno przypomina potwierdzenie.

Ubrania Sherlocka leza w stosie na podlodze, co jest tak niepodobne do niego, ze John patrzy przez chwile ponad nimi, az szkarlatne plamy przyciagaja jego uwage. Choc ubranie jest pogniecione, John moze dostrzec duze, niemal zaschniete, ciemnoczerwone plamy, ktore wsiakly w jego koszule. Podnosi ja i rejestruje iz opadla mu szczeka z powodu ilosci krwi, ktora dojrzal.

- Jezu, Sherlock... czy ty... jestes pewien, ze nie jestes ranny?

- N-n-nie - odpowiada Sherlock, szczekajac zebami. Jego glos jest niski i dobiega gdzies z dolu. John odsuwa nieco zaslone i widzi przez pare wodna, dlugie palce u nog i kolana oraz mocno owiniete wokol nich ramiona Sherlocka. Siedzi on na dnie brodzika, skulony tak mocno, jak tylko moze. Goraca woda lecaca z prysznica parzy jego skore do czerwonosci i napelnia pomieszczenie para, ale Sherlock drzy gwaltownie, jakby przenikaly go ogromne dreszcze.

- Jest mi tak ... z-zimno - udaje mu sie powiedziec gdy patrzy na Johna spod ociekajacych woda ciemnych lokow.

- Drzenie neurogenne  - mamrocze John do siebie. Wypaczona ewolucyjnie wersja walki lub ucieczki. Powodz hormonow stresu, wywolujaca drzenie miesni glebokich. Siega do srodka i zakreca prysznic. Glowa Sherlocka opada na trzesace sie kolana, ktore uderzaja o siebie pod dygoczacymi ramionami.

John chwyta dwa reczniki z polki pod zlewem i kladzie jeden na ramionach Sherlocka, a drugi na krawedzi brodzika. - Wytrzyj sie, przynioslem ci czyste ubranie. Gdy sie uspokoisz, zrobi sie tobie cieplej.

Sherlock marszczy brwi.

 -Jestem spo-kojny - protestuje, ale jego przekonanie ginie w drzeniu jego glosu.

Przeczesujac dlonia wlosy, John bierze gleboki oddech i wycofuje sie z powrotem do pokoju.

Wszystko wyglada pozornie normalnie i widac, ze w mieszkaniu ktos na co dzien rezyduje; jest balagan, stosy poczty, kilka rozrzuconych ubran, naczynia w zlewie i niezaslane lozko. Nie jest to miejsce, ktorym mozna by sie chwalic. John jest nagle bardzo wdzieczny za ich domostwo przy Baker Street.

Drzwi do lazienki otwieraja sie ze skrzypieniem i pojawia sie Sherlock, z recznikiem zawiazanym wokol talii i drugim owinietym wokol ramion; widac, ze wciaz ma dreszcze.

- Siadaj - poleca John, podprowadzajac go w nogi lozka. Z bliska widzi plamy na poduszce i przescieradle, nie od razu zauwazalne na tle ciemnego koloru. Unosi podbrodek Sherlocka, zeby spojrzec mu w oczy. Obie zrenice wydaja sie byc tej samej wielkosci i normalnie reaguja na swiatlo. John zaluje, ze nie mial tyle rozsadku, by zabrac ze soba cala torbe medyczna.  - Wodz wzrokiem za moim palcem - mowi cicho John, a Sherlock robi to bez narzekania. Doktor kladzie palce na szyi Sherlocka mierzac mu puls, ktory jest nieco podwyzszony, ale nie niepokojaco. Kilka analogicznych nastepujacych po stresie uwarunkowan. Cisnienie krwi tez jest w normie, sadzac po tym, jak latwo bylo odnalezc tetno dystalne.* 

- Masz mdlosci? Jestes oszolomiony? - docieka dalej.

- Nie - odpowiada cicho Sherlock - Chociaz ocknalem sie w tym lozku z okropnym bolem glowy.

- A ten co tu mieszka? Darren Mather? Jestes pewien, ze go tu nie bylo?

- Kiedy sie obudzilem, bylem sam ... ale... nie pamietam niczego wczesniej.

- Jaka jest ostatnia rzecz, ktora pamietasz?

- Zjedlismy curry na obiad - mowi Sherlock, ze zmarszczonymi brwiami i nieobecnym spojrzeniem.

- To bylo dwa dni temu - odpowiada John. - Powiedziales mi, ze zamierzasz odwiedzic rodzicow i pojedziesz wieczornym pociagiem. Przypuszczam, ze do nich nie dotarles.

Sherlock wymamrotal cos potakujaco, lecz z lekkim roztargnieniem.

- Wlasciwe pytanie - buczy z sarkazmem John - brzmi: czy w ogole  kiedykolwiek zamierzales tam dotrzec.

Sherlock wzrusza ramionami i kreci glowa, po czym wydaje z siebie sfrustrowany pomruk i chwyta sie za skronie.

Jego frustracja, jego tak bardzo nietypowa, zatrwazajaca nieswiadomosc wydaje sie autentyczna Johnowi, ktory pochyla sie, szukajac kontaktu wzrokowego. - Razi cie swiatlo?

- Nie.  Ja po prostu... nic nie pamietam. To irytujace.

Uraz glowy latwo by to wszystko wyjasnil, wiec John podnosi glowe Sherlocka do gory i przeczesuje palcami jego wilgotne loki, sprawdzajac, czy nie ma guzow lub skaleczen, ale nic nie znajduje. Cofa sie, nastepne pytanie utyka mu w gardle. - Czy... brales cos?

-Nie.

- Przeciez mowiles, ze nic pamietasz.

- Wiec po co mnie o to pytasz? -  warczy Sherlock. Wypuszcza sfrustrowany oddech. - Gdybym nawet  to zrobil ... gdybym cos wzial - szydzi - nie ma na to zadnych dowodow.

 Prycha niecierpliwie, kiedy widzi, jak oczy Johna przesuwaja sie do zgiecia jego ramienia. - Mozesz sobie sprawdzic, jesli mi nie wierzysz.

- Sherlock, wiesz rownie dobrze jak ja, ze halucynogeny nie sa zazwyczaj wstrzykiwane. Mozna je rowniez podawac w sposob, ktorego moglbys nie zauwazyc.

Sherlock szturcha go w ramie palcem wskazujacym. - Jestes realny, a wiec najwyrazniej nie mam halucynacji na temat ciebie tutaj, ani nie doswiadczam zadnych objawow wskazujacych na oslabienie po dawce stymulantow badz opiatow.

John unosi rece w gescie poddania sie.  - I jestes pewien, ze nie masz zadnych zranien ani siniakow? - pyta, chociaz Sherlock jest teraz owiniety recznikami  tylko w pasie, wiec John widzi to na wlasne oczy.

- Zadnych.

- Nie boli cie brzuch?

- Odrobine sie zdenerwowalem - mruczy niechetnie Sherlock.

- W porzadku - mowi John, trac czolo. Podnosi torbe, ktora przyniosl z miejsca przy drzwiach, rozpina ja i kladzie stos ubran na lozku obok Sherlocka. - Ubieraj sie. Zalatwie nam taksowke - Wyciaga komorke i otwiera aplikacje z mapami. - Mysle, ze Whittington jest niedaleko stad.

Glowa Sherlocka podskakuje do gory. - Whittington? Jak szpital w Whittington?

John zmierza go swoim najlepszym spojrzeniem typu ,,nawet nie probuj"".  - Tak. Oczywiscie, musimy ...

- Nie jade do zadnego szpitala! - wykrzykuje Sherlock, odskakujac, by wstac i majac nadzieje, ze John nie zauwazy, kiedy chwieje sie przez chwile.

- Sherlock, posluchaj mnie - blaga John. - Musi cie obejrzec neurolog. To jest powazne: nie pamietasz znacznej czesci czasu, masz silny bol glowy, twoje dzialania i mysli sa spowolnione ...

Sherlockowi opada szczeka. - Moje mysli z pewnoscia NIE sa spowolnione!

Brwi Johna unosza sie  - Serio? To powiedz mi: jak zarabia na zycie Darren Mather?

Oczy Sherlocka biegaja po pokoju, probujac uchwycic wskazowki, znalezc powiazania, ale John widzi, ze konczy sie to niepowodzeniem. W pokoju panuje balagan, wokol rozsianych jest wystarczajaco duzo dowodow, tak ze Sherlock zwykle juz zorientowalby sie w historii zycia tego mezczyzny.

John kreci glowa. - Nie udalo ci sie wydedukowac ani jednej rzeczy o tej sytuacji, o tej kawalerce, o jej mieszkancu, ani o tym skad tyle krwi na twoim ubraniu. A moze wlasnie zapomniales wspomniec o swoich odkryciach? To raczej nie lezy w twojej naturze, moglbym dodac. Geniusz potrzebuje publicznosci i tak dalej.

Sherlock patrzy gniewnie, ale jego milczenie mowi wiele. Nie moze ukryc swojego oszolomienia przed kims, kto zna go tak dobrze, jak John.

- To moze byc oznaka problemu z doplywem krwi do mozgu lub wirusa ... moze zapalenia mozgu. Mozliwy jest rowniez atak epileptyczny. Nawet jesli to TGA**  to diagnoza ustalana jest przez wykluczenie wielu innych rzeczy  - jednak zdecydowanie odpedza mysl o guzach mozgu i tetniakach. - A co, jesli wykaszlales cala te krew? Moglo to byc krwawienie z przewodu pokarmowego - zwraca uwage.

Jednak John watpi, ze tak jest, poniewaz zauwazylby znajomy, obrzydliwie mdlacy zapach wymiocin zmieszanych z zakrzepla krwia, ale Sherlock w jego obecnym stanie wydaje sie zbyt oszolomiony by kontrargumentowac. Zwykle jest bardzo bystry, jesli chodzi o sprawy medyczne, wiec jego brak dyskusji jest alarmujaco godny uwagi.

 - Niezaleznie od tego, musisz byc zbadany w szpitalu. Jedziemy taksowka albo wzywam karetke. Twoj wybor.

Sherlock zaciska szczeke, zrzuca recznik i siega po stos ubran. Koszula i spodnie sa lekko wygniecione, ale na szczescie gatki sa czyste.

- Zlapalem pierwsze twoje ciuchy, ktore znalazlem na szczycie wypranego stosu w lazience - mowi przepraszajaco John, obserwujac Sherlocka ostroznym okiem lekarza. - Nie chcialem tracic czasu na dotarcie do ciebie, a musialem jeszcze sprawdzic, co z Rosie i zaniesc elektroniczna nianie do pani Hudson ... - urywa, przekonany, ze jego pacjent jednak nie upadnie, i odwraca sie z powrotem, by dac Sherlockowi odrobine prywatnosci.

Sherlock podnosi torbe, a John podejrzewa, ze ma nadzieje znalezc tam przybory toaletowe. Bez pewnego produktu jego wlosy sa szybko schnaca, kedzierzawa katastrofa, ale w torbie nie ma juz nic wiecej, poniewaz John o tym nie pomyslal, no i w sumie nie to bylo priorytetem.

- Moj plaszcz? - pyta Sherlock, rozgladajac sie po pokoju.

John kreci glowa. - Nie bylo go w twoim pokoju ani na wieszaku przy drzwiach. Mysle, ze bym go nie przeoczyl. Jestem pewien, ze miales go przy sobie, kiedy wyjezdzales.

W torbie pozostaly juz tylko buty. John odwraca sie, kiedy slyszy, jak uderzaja o podloge i bez slowa wskazuje Sherlockowi, ze powinien znowu usiasc.

- Nic mi nie jest - protestuje Sherlock, ale John tylko zaciska usta i patrzy na niego przez chwile, zanim ustapi. Doktor kleka i wsuwa buty na stopy Sherlocka, zawiazujac sznurowki szybko i mocno. Wstaje i wyciaga reke.

Sherlock patrzy na to i wzdycha znaczaco, po czym staje sam. - John, przysiegam ci, nic mi nie jest. Jesli popelniono przestepstwo, a ja tam bylem, to musze wiedziec, co sie stalo. I musimy to zrobic teraz, zanim Met zlapie wiatr w zagle i zanieczysci moje miejsce zbrodni.

- Obiecuje ci, ze poznasz wszystkie szczegoly. Ale najpierw musimy sie upewnic, ze z toba wszystko w porzadku. Problemy neurologiczne moga szybko postepowac. Tetniaki potrafia sie pojawic w mgnieniu oka. Nie mamy czasu do stracenia. Jesli nadal chcesz sie o to klocic, to mozesz to robic na tylnym siedzeniu taksowki.

John wyczekujaco przytrzymuje skrzydlo drzwi dla Sherlocka.

- Moje ubrania? - pyta Sherlock, spogladajac w strone lazienki.

John oblizuje usta i przez chwile spoglada w dol. - Sa przeciez dowodami. Powinnismy je zostawic. Kiedy dotrzemy do szpitala, zadzwonimy do Lestrada i poinformujemy go, co sie stalo.

- Ale my wiemy, co sie stalo.

- Nie  - zgadza sie John - ale to nie wyglada dobrze. I chce miec pewnosc, ze cokolwiek wydarzy sie pozniej, bedziemy miec kogos po naszej stronie od poczatku tej sprawy.

- Ja nikogo nie ...

- Jasne, ze nie - mowi szybko i szczerze John, ale jego wyraz twarzy jest ponury. - Ale to nie mnie byc moze bedziesz musial przekonywac.

Spojrzenie, ktore rzuca mu Sherlock, mowi Johnowi, iz wie, ze doktor ma racje.

Jest jeszcze pewna rzecz. Jeszcze tylko jedna rzecz, ktora nalezy omowic, ale to jest ta najtrudniejsza. John przelyka sline, wyciaga reke, by powstrzymac Sherlocka przed wyjsciem. Zoladek lekko mu sie skreca na mysl o tym, co musi powiedziec.  - Kiedy dotrzemy do Whittington, mysle, ze powinienes rowniez rozwazyc badanie na okolicznosc zgwalcenia.

Oczy Sherlocka blyskaja zaskoczeniem, a potem zaprzecza. - Nie.

John powoli wypuszcza powietrze, aby dac sobie czas na znalezienie wlasciwych argumentow. Musi odwolac sie do logiki. - Budzisz sie w obcym lozku, w obcym mieszkaniu, nie majac pojecia, co sie wydarzylo. Nie masz zadnych widocznych obrazen, wiec ktos mogl cie odurzyc. Jaki jest najczestszy cel, dla ktorego ludzie robia takie rzeczy innym?

Taka mozliwosc przyszla Johnowi na mysl, odkad uslyszal odglos lecacej z prysznica wody. Widok Sherlocka trzesacego sie pod goracym prysznicem sprawil, ze podejrzewal tez wstrzas hipowolemiczny***  jako jedna z mozliwosci, ale woda splywala do odplywu juz czysta. Mimo to mysl, ze ktos moglby skrzywdzic Sherlocka w ten sposob, przyprawiala go o mdlosci. Mogla wywiazac sie walka. Napastnik zblizajacy sie do Sherlocka, krwawil z ust lub nosa i to moglo byc przyczyna czesci krwawych plam na jego koszuli.

- Myslisz, ze nie zauwazylbym ... ze poczulbym tego teraz, gdyby cos takiego mialo ...  - mowi zdenerwowany Sherlock. - Nic takiego sie nie wydarzylo. Wiedzialbym, gdyby tak sie stalo.

- Dobra - John potakuje. - Przepraszam. Po prostu ... nie chce ryzykowac, jasne?

- Potrzebuje portfela - mowi Sherlock  raptownie zmieniajac temat, obracajac sie na piecie i wbiegajac z powrotem do lazienki. John slyszy szelest, gdy Sherlock grzebie w kieszeniach spodni, a potem wszystko nagle cichnie.

- Sherlock? - glos Johna jest napiety, walczy ze znajomym rozblyskiem asekuracyjnego gniewu. Sherlock wychodzi z lazienki i w milczacej odpowiedzi wyciaga w rece pek kluczy. Stojac przy drzwiach, John widzi kilka metalowych kluczy do domu i stary, porysowany kluczyk samochodowy. Wszystkie sa pokryte krwia, a na breloku z Union Jackiem pojawila sie duza czerwona plama. Unosi brwi, gdy detektyw podchodzi do jedynego malego okienka w kawalerce, naciska przycisk zamka na kluczyku i patrzy, jak w odpowiedzi na to swiatlami miga stary srebrny datsun na ulicy ponizej.

- Sherlock? - tym razem ciszej, ale bardziej niecierpliwie. - Musimy isc.

Im szybciej dotra do szpitala i wykonaja badania laboratoryjne oraz dokladne badania neurologiczne, tym szybciej znajda odpowiedzi.

- Coz, John, mamy szczescie. Wyglada na to, ze nasza podwozka juz tu jest.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Samochod jest w takim samym stanie jak kawalerka; maly, niechlujny, bardzo sfatygowany, lecz wydaje sie byc sprawny. Sherlock otwiera drzwi pasazera i nie marnuje czasu przegladajac schowek, znajduje dowod rejestracyjny.

- To Darrena Mathera? - pyta John obok niego, a Sherlock pomrukuje potwierdzajaco.

Sprawdza reszte smieci walajacych sie po samochodzie: przewody do odpalania akumulatora, kilka opakowan po jedzeniu na wynos  i pusty kubek po kawie. W drugim uchwycie na kubek jest wizytowka: ,,Marissa Delamere - specjalistka psychoterapii holistycznej i odzyskiwania pamieci.""

John podchodzi do drzwi kierowcy i pochyla sie, zeby zajrzec do srodka. - Na kierownicy jest krew - oznajmia ponuro, odwracajac sie, by spojrzec na Sherlocka, ale cos innego przykuwa jego uwage i jego twarz jeszcze bardziej sie nachmurza.  -  A na tylnym siedzeniu lezy cos, co wyglada dokladnie jak twoja torba podrozna.

Sherlock odwraca sie, zeby spojrzec. John ma racje. Wysiada z samochodu, otwiera tylne drzwi i wyjmuje torbe.

- Chryste, Sherlock - wydycha John, przeczesujac dlonia wlosy. Kreci glowa z niedowierzaniem, patrzac na detektywa znad samochodu. - Musimy zadzwonic do Lestrade. Bierzmy taksowke i jedzmy do szpitala. Zadzwonimy do niego po drodze .

Blysk zolci przyciaga wzrok Sherlocka, wiec siega na podloge, by wyciagnac maly, naddarty kawalek zoltego papieru w linie. Adres zapisany odrecznie. Sherlock unosi kartke, marszczac brwi.

John staje obok niego. - Co to jest?

- Adres w Milbury.

- To twoje pismo.

Sherlock wpisuje adres do swojej komorki i mruczy pod nosem - To nie daleko. Mozemy tam byc w mniej niz dwadziescia minut.

Oczy Johna rozszerzaja sie. - O, nie. Absolutnie nie! Jedziemy ...

- Do szpitala; tak, tak. - przerywa mu detektyw - Ale w rzeczywistosci szpital Royal Claringdon znajduje sie tuz obok  i ma lepsza renome, niz ten w Whittington, a jesli pamiec mnie nie myli, wspomniales kiedys, ze znasz kilku tamtejszych lekarzy, co sprawia, ze staje sie on wygodniejsza opcja. Rzut oka, aby sprawdzic dokad prowadza tropy, a nastepnie prosto na izbe przyjec  -  zaczyna isc w strone glownej drogi, by znalezc taksowke, a John biegnie za nim.

Zatrzymuja sie na rogu, Sherlock obserwuje cicha ulice jak jastrzab. John jest niemal siny ze zlosci: ma zacisnieta szczeka, rozdete nozdrza. Potrzasa glowa.  - Nie pojmuje, dlaczego nie traktujesz tego powaznie. Zawsze upierasz sie, ze twoj umysl jest dla ciebie najwazniejszy, a reszta to tylko ,,transport""; ale teraz to wlasnie twoj umysl jest w niebezpieczenstwie, a ty wydajesz  sie tym zupelnie nie przejmowac.

Sherlock obraca sie, by na niego spojrzec.  - Oczywiscie, ze sie przejmuje! Doprowadza mnie to do szalu! Brakuje mi wspomnien z dwoch dni! Ale badzmy szczerzy, John. Ty i ja wiemy, ze to, co odkrylismy do tej pory przedstawia bardzo niefortunny obraz tego, co robilem w tym czasie, ktorego nie pamietam. Zasluguje przynajmniej na szanse, aby sprobowac dowiedziec sie jak najwiecej dla samego siebie, zanim mnie skuja.

- Sherlock, to nie to samo, co wparowanie do szpitala z rana postrzalowa - nie beda mieli powodu, aby wzywac policje, jesli przedstawimy im tylko twoje objawy.

- I zaryzykowac ze slad ostygnie? Ludzie zawsze maja... ludzi, a oni dowiedza sie, co sie stalo z ... z... - trudem probuje przypomniec sobie imie.

- Darrenem Matherem - podpowiada zaniepokojony John.  - Sam widzisz, o co mi chodzi. Nie funkcjonujesz normalnie.

Sherlock z oburzeniem odwraca sie i przywoluje taksowke, ktora wlasnie wylonila sie zza zakretu.

John wypuszcza sfrustrowany oddech przez nos, gdy podjezdza czarna taksowka. - Dobra - ustepuje. - Ale najwyzej piec minut. Potem prosto do szpitala. Zgoda?

Sherlock robi niewinna mine i otwiera drzwi samochodu dla Johna - Slowo skauta - mowi.

 

***

 

467 Hawksmoor Road w Milbury wyglada jakby byla nie na swoim miejscu. Zrujnowana, przewaznie opustoszala ulica w bogatej dzielnicy, niektore biznesiki wciaz tu dzialaja, ale to branze niszowe, istniejace tu juz oczywiscie szmat czasu; warsztat samochodowy, zakurzona wypozyczalnia instrumentow muzycznych i sklep z ubezpieczeniami. Sa tam takze pozostalosci zburzonych budynkow, fragmenty fundamentow,  stosy gruzu i smieci. Wyglada na to, ze gentryfikacja wisi nad tym miejscem jak deszczowa chmura, czekajaca tylko na okazje, aby ulewa oczyscic teren.

Drzwi z numerem 467 to srodkowy z trzech budynkow i niewiele wiecej niz drzwi miedzy dwoma witrynami sklepowymi. Numer 465 wyglada na dawno opuszczony: okna zamalowane, wyblakle informacje o wynajmie przyklejone tasma do drzwi; natomiast 469 to sklep z artykulami uzywanymi, bez polotu nazwany ,,Druga Szansa"". Zaden sklep na ulicy nie jest jeszcze otwarty, slonce wciaz jest stosunkowo nisko na porannym horyzoncie.  Patrzac na strukture budynku, oczywiste jest, ze to, co znajduje sie za drzwiami z numerem 467, to nic innego jak schody prowadzace do wynajmowanego lokalu na pietrze.

- Prosze zaczekac, wracamy za piec minut - mowi  John taksowkarzowi, ktory kiwa glowa ale i przypomina, ze licznik nadal bije.

Zgadzaja sie najpierw rozdzielic i obejrzec zewnetrzna strone budynku, ale gdy tylko John znika za rogiem

wyznaczonego mu boku, Sherlock podbiega z powrotem do taksowki.

- Wyglada na to, ze potrwa to troche dluzej, niz myslelismy - mowi kierowcy, podajac banknot za przejazd przez spuszczona szybe. - Zadzwonimy po inna taksowke, jak juz bedziemy gotowi wracac.

- Jestes pan pewien? - pyta taksowkarz, spogladajac z powatpiewaniem w kierunku, w ktorym poszedl John.

- Tak, zdecydowanie. To troche potrwa.

Taksowkarz wzrusza ramionami i odjezdza. Chwile pozniej John wraca ze swej ,,wyprawy"" dookola budynku i zaczyna biec, gdy widzi oddalajace sie tylne swiatla taksowki.

- Ej!

Sherlock robi krok do przodu, by spotkac podbiegajacego Johna.

- Prosilem, zeby zaczekal!

- A ja mu powiedzialem, ze nie musi. Zadzwonimy po inna, gdy skonczymy.

- Niech cie cholera Sherlock!

- To miejsce wydaje mi sie znajome, John. To tak, jakby wspomnienie bylo gdzies z tylu mojej glowy, jestem juz blisko, by je zlapac. Musimy wejsc do srodka.

- Ta sytuacja jest juz wystarczajaco zla bez aresztowania nas za wlamanie. Jesli to, co tam ewentualnie znajdziemy, ma zwiazek z... z tym, co ci sie przydarzylo w ciagu ostatnich dwoch dni...

Nagle, bez ostrzezenia, ogromny bol przeszywa glowe Sherlocka jak blyskawica. Nie moze powstrzymac sie od krzyku, chwytajac sie za skronie w daremnej probie powstrzymania udreki.

Czuje rece Johna na swoich ramionach, slyszy jego spanikowany glos wolajacy go po imieniu, ale rzeczywistosc znika, a otoczenie sie oddala.

 

 


Znowu krzyczy i lzy splywaja mu teraz po twarzy. Plomienie sie zblizaja, pomieszczenie pochlania pieklo. Na chwile zostaje oszolomiony, gdy stoi przy drzwiach i patrzy, jak posciel na jego lozku zapala sie. Raz jeszcze ciagnie i przekreca klamke. - MYCROFT! - krzyczy.



Eurus stoi przed nim, beznamietne oczy wbijaja w niego spojrzenie spomiedzy podskakujacych warkoczykow. - To  ze mna masz sie bawic - mowi, ale to jest tak, jakby ogien przemawial do niego, a nie mala dziewczynka; jej slowa hucza i trzaskaja. - A on niech sobie idzie do domu! - Victor odwzajemnia jej spojrzenie ze zloscia, po czym oddala sie w kierunku plazy ze swoim mieczem w rece. Placze.



Nagle plomienie znikaja, i jego ulubiona pluszowa zabawka jest na lozku, ale cos jest nie tak, poniewaz wspomnienie nie moze pochodzic z tego samego dnia. Zweglone, rozmoczone szczatki czegos, co kiedys bylo trzmielem, miekkie zolto-czarne futerko, podarowane mu przez babcie, gdy sie urodzil. To grozba.



Widzi, jak Mycroft stoi przed ich rodzicami; skads wzial sie na dole schodow.



Matka trzyma glowe w dloniach, ojciec jest odwrocony plecami, wpatrujac sie w huczacy ogniem kominek.



- Ona wami manipuluje! - krzyczy Mycroft i zamiast swojego doroslego brata, Sherlock widzi Mycrofta -jedenastolatka. Przyjechal ze szkoly, gdy Victor zaginal. 



Tatus jest wsciekly: - Przyjada po niego wieczorem i koniec! Tak bedzie najbezpieczniej dla nas wszystkich!  



Wydaje sie, jakby Sherlock nie rozumial tych slow. Mycroft odwraca sie lekko i widzi Sherlocka na schodach. Spotykaja sie  wzrokiem na chwile, zanim Sherlock ucieka z powrotem do swojej sypialni.



Zatrzaskuje za soba drzwi. Ale jest przerazony, widzac, ze wrocil w sam srodek  burzy ognia. Drzwi za nim znow sa zamkniete. Plomienie odcinaja mu droge. Jego gardlo plonie od goracego powietrza. Nie jest juz w stanie krzyczec. Nie moze juz oddychac. Nie moze...


 


 


- Sherlock? Sherlock, slyszysz mnie? - dlon na jego twarzy, kciuk glaszczacy go po kosci policzkowej. - Otworz oczy. Dalej Sherlock, otworz oczy. - glos Johna jest rozkazujacy, ale zdesperowany. Czuje zapach szamponu doktora, gdy ten pochyla sie blisko, nasluchujac jego oddechu.

Sherlock w koncu zbiera cala swoja energie, by byc poslusznym. - Dzieki Bogu - dyszy John, gdy Sherlock w koncu otwiera oczy, krzywiac sie na jasnoniebieskie niebo. Lezy plasko na plecach, trawa laskocze go w dlonie, a serce mu wali.

- Wiesz gdzie jestes? - dopytuje sie John, przygladajac mu sie, pochylil sie blizej, aby zbadac odruchy zrenic. - Sherlock? Slyszysz mnie?

Sherlock przelyka sline, probujac otrzasnac sie z dezorientacji, ktora przyszpila jego zdolnosc do jasnego myslenia. - Co sie stalo?

- Zlapales sie za glowe i krzyczales, a potem straciles przytomnosc - mowi John, palcami maca puls na Sherlockowym nadgarstku. - Ledwo cie zlapalem, zebys nie rozbil sobie o cos glowy. Jezu - oddycha ciezko, jakby biegl.

-  Pamietasz, gdzie jestesmy?

- Pojechalismy pod adres z tej notatki, ktora znalazlem w samochodzie Darrena Mathera - odpowiada Sherlock bez wahania, po czym probuje usiasc, ale natychmiast czuje nacisk silnych dloni na ramionach.

 - Mowy nie ma. Lez spokojnie - instruuje John. - Jaka jest ostatnia rzecz, ktora pamietasz?

Sherlock sie poddaje i pozwala Johnowi pomoc mu ulozyc sie na plecach; kreci mu sie w glowie, wiec pomysl wstawania nie wydaje sie zachecajacy.

 - Odjezdzajaca taksowka.

Na twarzy Johna pojawia sie cien. - Tak, cholernie dobra robota. Gdybym nie zgodzil sie na te bzdury, bylibysmy na ostrym dyzurze, kiedy to sie stalo. Jak sie czujesz?

Sherlock probuje sie skoncentrowac, ale macki wspomnien nie odpuszczaja i groza, ze go wciagna. Sa przerazajace, i on potrzebuje Johna, by zatrzymal go w rzeczywistosci. Stara sie wyrazic slowami widoki i dzwieki przelatujace przez jego umysl. - Bylem... znowu bylem dzieckiem... plonal dom, byla tam Eurus i ogien odcial mi droge ... to bylo takie realne.

John marszczy brwi. - Istnieja obszary mozgu, gdzie moga zostac wywolane halucynacje podczas napadow padaczki. Z praktyk na neurologii pamietam pacjentow, ktorzy nawet po jakims czasie pamietali swoje projekcje z napadow.

- Ale to bylo realne wspomnienie, John, jestem tego pewien. To bylo prawdziwe. I nie mialem ataku epilepsji, prawda?

- Nie mozemy tego wiedziec bez EEG*  i bez wykluczenia innych rzeczy. Straciles przytomnosc, a nie wszystkie napady kloniczne**  maja objawy toniczne***  To mogl byc jakis napad nieswiadomosci****

- Nie mam epilepsji John. I czy bole glowy nie powinny wystapic po napadzie, a nie przed nim?

- Dlatego potrzebujemy testow, aby wykluczyc inne rzeczy.

- Na przyklad jakie?

- A to juz ci powie neurolog, Sherlock.

- Teraz czuje sie dobrze.

John szuka w kieszeni telefonu komorkowego. - Zdecydowanie nie jest dobrze. Niespodziewanie straciles przytomnosc i doswiadczyles jakiegos znaczacego wydarzenia mozgowego. Jedziemy do szpitala. Natychmiast.

John w krotkich odstepach wybiera trzy cyferki na swoim telefonie i Sherlock wie, ze nie ma sensu sie klocic. Poza tym rozmowa przyprawia go o zawroty glowy.

- Mowi doktor John Watson; jestem przy 467 Hawksmoor Road w Milbury. Potrzebuje erki dla pacjenta do najblizszego szpitala z oddzialem  neurologicznym. Mezczyzna, lat 37,  bez znanej historii chorob neurologicznych. Mial serie podejrzanych atakow z amnezja. Zadnych trudnosci z mowieniem ani zaburzen funkcji motorycznych, ktore bym zauwazyl. Bardzo krotki, niezwykle silny bol glowy typu napadowego przed utrata przytomnosci.

John marszczy brwi, sluchajac dyspozytora. - Tak, teraz jest przytomny, zrenice symetryczne i reaguja na swiatlo, oddycha normalnie...

Jeszcze przez chwile slucha, po czym zwraca sie do Sherlocka.  - Jakis bol w klatce piersiowej?

- Nie.

John ponownie zwraca sie do dyspozytora. - Nie, bez bolu w klatce piersiowej - Kolejna pauza. - Nudnosci?

Sherlock tym razem probuje usiasc, odpychajac rece Johna i unikajac odpowiedzi na pytanie.  - NIC. MI. NIE JEST - przelyka zolc, ktora juz dlawi go w gardle.

John rzuca mu spojrzenie, ktore mogloby zmrozic pieklo, ale niechetnie pomaga Sherlockowi usiasc, sciskajac telefon miedzy uchem a ramieniem. - Co to za skrzyzowanie? - rozglada sie, mruzac oczy, na slupek z nazwami ulic, stojacy na rogu w oddali  - Nie ruszaj sie - rzuca Sherlockowi, po czym szybko biegnie w kierunku rogu. Tyle czasu wystarcza detektywowi. Zrywa sie bez problemu, zachwycony, ze mysli juz jasniej, a zawroty glowy sa znosne.

- Cholera, Sherlock! -  wrzeszczy John za jego plecami, gdy detektyw podchodzi do drzwi.

- To nie jest wlamanie, jesli mamy klucze - mowi nonszalancko.

- To nawet nie jest prawda - wscieka sie John. - Niedlugo tu beda, powinnismy zostac i czekac.

Na kolku z brelokiem nie ma zbyt wielu kluczy, a Sherlock trafia na wlasciwy juz za drugim podejsciem. Drzwi otwieraja sie, ukazujac dlugie schody, z okien powyzej wpada dzienne swiatlo. Sherlock powoli wchodzi do malego przedpokoju, po czym rusza w gore po schodach, ale John rzuca sie do przodu, i chwyta go za ramie. - Zaszedles juz wystarczajaco daleko. Karetka jest w drodze, chodz, zaczekamy na nia na zewnatrz.

- Kiedy zaroi sie tu od policji, juz nigdy nie obejrze tego miejsca - drzwi zamykaja sie za Johnem, przyciagajac wzrok Sherlocka. Klamka jest z postarzanego mosiadzu, ozdobiona drobnymi rozetami. I jeszcze cos. - Dobra. Ujme to inaczej: moze pozwola mi zobaczyc zdjecia tego lokum jako dowod na moim procesie - dodaje ponuro Sherlock, a John odwraca sie, by spojrzec.

- Jezu, to ...

- Krew, tak. Nie sadze, aby zalozenie, ze moje odciski palcow rowniez gdzies tam sa, bylo bardzo nonsensowne.

Tym razem, gdy Sherlock zaczyna wchodzic po schodach, protest Johna sie zmienia. Bez slowa zatrzymuje Sherlocka i wyprzedza go, by objac dowodzenie.

Wchodza cicho po schodach, znajdujac na szczycie ciche, zatechle studio artystyczne. Poranne slonce wlewa sie przez duze okna wzdluz frontowej sciany, oswietlajac pomieszczenie cieplym swiatlem. Latwo jest dostrzec sylwetki sztalug, na wielu z nich jest cos, co wyglada jak obrazy. John mruzy oczy, gdy jego wzrok dostosowuje sie do swiatla otoczenia.

Wyglada na to, ze Sherlockowi wystarczyla ta chwila, zeby sobie cos skojarzyl, gdy obraca sie  powoli by obejrzec przestrzen. - Pamietam to - mruczy pod nosem. - Coz, niezupelnie, ale wydaje sie to zbyt znajome, aby moglo byc zbiegiem okolicznosci.

- Myslisz, ze byles tu wczesniej?

- Moze.

- Sherlock, deja vu moze byc objawem ucisku w placie skroniow ...

- Zamknij sie i daj mi pomyslec!

Znajduja wlacznik swiatla w poblizu schodow i wreszcie moga lepiej przyjrzec sie temu miejscu. Pokoj jest wypelniony plotnami roznych rozmiarow, niektore na sztalugach, inne ulozone pod scianami. Teczowe plamy z farby akrylowej wygladaja jak rozsiane po podlodze konfetti. Rozrzucone pedzle i palety leza na stolach i stolkach.

- Chryste - mowi John, kiedy widza obrazy. Oglada jeden z nich z chorobliwym zdumieniem: krzyczaca meska postac w absolutnej udrece, odrywajaca sobie twarz.- To jak z horroru - cialo, miesnie i sciegna odrywajace sie od kosci sa w jaskrawych, niepokojaco realistycznych barwach. Tlo jest poprzecinane szerokimi, gwaltownymi pociagnieciami czerni, bieli i czerwieni.

Sherlock podchodzi do kolejnej sztalugi, a potem do nastepnej. - Wszystkie sa takie same - mowi, a John rozglada sie, i stwierdza, ze ma racje. Po pracowni jest porozstawiane co najmniej pietnascie niemal identycznych odmian tego samego obrazu, rozniacych sie w zasadzie tylko rozmiarem plotna.

Oboje odwracaja sie do okien, slyszac w oddali nagle wycie syren, kierujace sie  bez watpienia w ich strone.

John odwraca sie w strone schodow, aby zasugerowac, ze zejda na dol, ale jego stopa zaczepia o jakis material. Masa znajomej ciemnej welny z jaskrawoczerwonymi dziurkami, ktora John widzi kazdego dnia.

- Sherlock, to twoj...

I wtedy to widza. Wielka bordowa kaluza akrylowej farby, konczaca sie na samym plaszczu. W niektorych miejscach nadal lsni wilgocia.

Ida po sladzie do zrodla. Ukryte za stolem warsztatowym i rolkami plotna, lezy cialo bardzo martwego mezczyzny. Zaschnieta krew otacza ziejaca rane na jego szyi. Obok jego dloni lezy zakrwawiony noz rzemieslniczy.

Sherlock ciezko wypuszcza powietrze. - Darren Mather, jak przypuszczam.

Syreny slychac juz dole ulicy. Beda tu lada chwila, a obecnie w londynskie karetki sa eskortowane przez policje.

Spojrzenie Sherlocka jest spanikowane. - Wiejemy. Jesli zobacza, ze wyszlismy stad, kiedy go znajda ...

John chwyta go za ramie i kieruja sie na schody. Kiedy zbiegaja, wyciaga komorke i szybko wybiera numer. - Lestrade? Stalo sie cos. Tak, chodzi o Sherlocka. Czy mozesz sie z nami spotkac na oddziale ratunkowym szpitala Royal Claringdon?

It compels me to admit that infants, such as yourself, are no better than me when it comes to depending on John for incessant needs and wants without him expecting anything in return."" 

 

Sherlock's voice sounds soft even to his own ears, resonating around the walls of 221B Baker Street, soft, just like the morning light glowing through the curtains, soft, just like the warmth in his heart. Sherlock picks up the baby in front of him and holds her carefully against his chest. He smiles at the tiny human in his arms. A smile which quickly turns into a glare when he sees John smirking behind him. 

 

""Have you been dyeing your hair darker?""

 

John frowns, unconsciously raising a hand to touch his hair. 

 

""What, you don't like it?"" 

 

""You're losing your natural silver streaks, John."" 

 

John simply huffs crossing his arms: ""Gray hair makes me feel old.""

 

Sherlock can't help but roll his eyes: ""You are old."" 

 

""Thanks. Really appreciate that, Sherlock."" John's voice, dripping with sarcasm is at odds with the self-conscious look in his eyes.

 

Sherlock just frowns, confused: ""What's wrong with getting old? Silver hair is part of ageing. I've got grey hair. It doesn't bother me."" 

 

John swiftly looks away: ""I just don't like it on me. Give me a break."" 

 

Sherlock huffs and bounces the child in his arms, disliking John's new look and preferring the previous one. He doesn't know how John can't realize how perfect he already is. In his arms, the baby moves again and Sherlock looks down and smiles. 

 

""At least you have inherited your mother's eyes and hair. That should compensate for the stubbornness you will most definitely inherit from your father.""

 

""Let's not talk about her, Sherlock. Anyway, today's a big day."" 

 

Sherlock mood immediately drops and he grimaces: ""Nothing is ""big"" about today."" 

 

John puts a hand on Sherlock's shoulder to bend down and picks up a bag at his feet: ""It's my daughter's first time in a daycare. I want you to be there."" 

 

""What is the point?"" 

 

""Babies meet other babies. It's kind of a requirement.""

 

Sherlock gathers the baby closer in his arms.

 

""No, it's not. More to the point, she doesn't need anyone else except you and I.""

 

He can spot John's soft smile on the other side of the room as the other man walks around gathering what they need. 

 

""Well, I don't disagree, but she needs to meet babies, too, you know."" 

 

""Oh, other babies will only decay her mind. She needs to be surrounded by intelligent humans. Like us. Not... mindless and smaller people who drool and cry every hour.""


John sends him a blank look: ""Wow. I can't believe I asked you to help me raise my daughter.""

 

Sherlock pushes away the feeling of pride to a corner of his heart and shrugs: ""I've got nothing else better to do. And besides, what kind of detective would I be if I can't solve cases while changing nappies every once in a while?"" 

 

John simply grins and watches as the detective holds up the baby. She touches Sherlock's face with her small hands and Sherlock's smile could light up the universe.

 

...

 

As soon as Sherlock and John arrive at the daycare center Mycroft enrolled her into, Sherlock can't help the disgusted noise escaping his lips.

 

""Oh, what a pleasant surprise. Children drooling all over the floors. How exciting.""

 

John puts a light but calming hand on Sherlock's forearm: ""I told you. Behave. It's not every day we take breaks from solving cases to spend time with my daughter.""

 

The daycare Lady seems to be a sweet woman. Her bright smile is reassuring when she meets them but Sherlock is too preoccupied with the child in his arms to deduce anything about her: ""Hi! You must be the Watsons, it's a pleasure to meet you both.""

 

Sherlock's heart unexpectedly rises up to his throat. 

 

""The Watsons? No, I am Sherlock Holmes, and this is my friend, Dr. John Watson.""

 

""Uh... yeah. We're here to chaperone my daughter on her first day. Are we late?"" 

 

The woman just smiles knowingly: ""You're just in time, please come with me. Sorry about that. Your daughter is going to enjoy it here. Can she walk already?""

 

John's smile can only be described as fond when he answers: ""Yeah. Sherlock just prefers to carry her.""

 

""What? No. No, it's just safer for her this way. Her limbs are strong and far more developed than most infants, yes, but you can never be too careful."" 

 

""Whatever you say, Sherlock. Just let me do the talking this time."" 

 

The daycare lady shows them around until they reach a room with children around the baby's age: ""Okay, so here we are. You can just let your little girl down over there by the other kids. Everyone here is friendly!""

 

Sherlock takes a step back and is stopped by John's frame behind him, pushing him forward:

 

""No. That boy over there just hid a ribbon belonging to that girl and is currently framing that other boy. I am telling you, John. Other children are as sadistic as the criminals we have encountered in past cases.''

 

John's eyes are bright with amusement but he still sends the daycare lady a contrite smile.

 

""Uh, he's kidding. Of course, he is. Just ignore him, that usually does the trick. Sherlock, your brother went out of his way in offering to get my daughter into a good daycare. The last thing I want is getting kicked out."" 

 

""John, I can definitely handle any type of learning strategy you'd like me to try. Your daughter is smarter than any child here. We don't need to be here.""

 

John takes his friend's arm again to guide him out of earshot after sending the lady an apologetic look.  

 

""Sherlock, I know you're worried about her getting attached to people other than us. There's nothing wrong with that. She'll still like you, she'll still come home with us. She just needs to play with children her own age.""

 

Sherlock casts his eyes away: ""It's not about that.""

 

""Then what is it? Why are you being like this?"" 

 

""I don't want anyone else to influence her other than us two. Other people tend to do that and it affects children until adulthood. Your daughter deserves to be around people who are not strangers to us."" 

 

John stares at Sherlock for a moment, and he laughs. Something bright and full of wonder. Sherlock glares at him but his face heats up.

 

""Oh, Sherlock. You'd be a great father."" 

 

Sherlock softens and looks down, his heart beating fast in his chest. He lets the baby down on the mat. She giggles, crawling up to the other children and starts playing. Sherlock's heart warms. How can someone so small be the source of so much love? He crosses his arms to his chest, already missing the warmth of the child in his arms.

 

""I could be reading the introduction of biochemistry to your daughter right now.""

 

John snorts: ""You really do ignore me when I say that those textbooks aren't bedtime stories, huh?"" 

 

He turns around to look at John, pretending to be offended: ""Those textbooks are educational, John. Unlike the one with a boy climbing a beanstalk that reached the sky, which is scientifically impossible. Something your daughter would know if you let me read to her."" 

 

""Hey, Sherlock? Remember when you used to want to be a pirate?"" 

 

Sherlock draws his shoulders up to his ears, hiding behind the collar of his coat as he feels his face heat again: ""Shut up, John."" 

 

Sherlock sees the parents smile at their own children. It makes him look at John's daughter as well, and he watches her giggle with another baby girl while holding a stuffed horse toy.

 

""You've got to admit, Sherlock, that's cute."" John bumps his shoulder, eyes filled with mirth.  

 

""I would never use the word ""cute"" for anyone other than your daughter."" 

 

John stays silent for a beat and Sherlock tries hard not to look at him, wondering if he said something wrong again. He hears a crisp intake of breath as John seems to collect himself: ""Yeah, but they're cute. Look at her playing with the little horse! Take a photo right now, Sherlock."" 

 

""John, I swear to God. It's as if you enjoy seeing me suffer."" 

 

He can feel his friend closer to his ear as he whispers: ""Do it, or I'll call over those parents to sit next to us.""

 

John is clearly enjoying the way Sherlock is grimacing as he snaps pictures of John's daughter with his phone. If Sherlock takes every picture making sure to voice his complaints, he knows he will never delete them. 

 

""There. Are you happy?""

 

By his side, John is laughing quietly, and Sherlock tries his best to suppress his own smile.

 

""I'm glad I could be of some amusement to you."" 

 

""Come on, just admit it. You like seeing her happy.""

 

Sherlock frowns slightly: ""It's not like I want to see her cry, John. Noise is already an abundance in Baker Street."" 

 

John's voice is barely more than a whisper as he looks at his friend: ""You love her. I know you do.""

 

Well, I love you, Sherlock thinks, but he knows it would be a bit not good to voice it out loud. Especially when everything has been going so well lately.

 

""I can't possibly hate anything that is half you."" 

 

John's breath seems to catch again and Sherlock casts a quick glance his way to find John straightening his shoulders, a faint blush to his cheeks: ""Oh... right. W-Well, that... that's nice of you.""

 

Sherlock and John sit in silence, just watching the baby giggle and play with the others, the noises around them filling the sudden void between them, noises around them, clinging to the words hanging between them, remaining unsaid, as always.

 

John clears his throat and it sounds deafening even in the loud room. He looks down at his hands, avoiding his friend's inquisitive look:

 

""Hm. Isn't this nice? Just two friends. Watching a baby together during their day off.""

 

Sherlock almost grimaces, he turns his head forward looking aimlessly off in the distance:  

 

""Yes, absolutely. Two friends."" 

 

""Well, I can definitely say I never imagined raising her with you, of all people.""

 

Sherlock's head whips around so fast he could've broken his neck:  

 

""What is that supposed to mean?"" he asks, almost offended, ""You think I cannot raise a child?"" 

 

John pales, a nervous hand raking through his hair: ""No, that's not it. I just meant that... you're you and I'm me. I always thought I'd... you know.""

 

Sherlock is just confused now. He straightens and imperceptibly moves away from John's side, hurt.  

 

""No, I don't."" 

 

""Come on, Sherlock. It's been months. I think you know."" 

 

Sherlock frowns at his friend sudden desperation:

 

""Know what?"" 

 

His friend's shoulders visibly sag: ""Never mind.""

 

""No, say what you were going to say.""

 

Still avoiding his friend's eyes, John hesitantly opens his mouth to say something but before any sound can escape it they are distracted by a loud and familiar cry coming from the small crowd. Sherlock almost flies away from his spot to kneel next to John's daughter, panic seizing up his insides. He carefully but frantically checks if she is hurt.

 

""She's fine, Sherlock, but I can't find the horse toy she was playing with.""

 

Sherlock lets out a relieved breath he didn't realize he was holding.  

 

""A toy? She is crying over a toy? Do babies cry over toys a lot?"" 

 

""Says the person who threw a tantrum over hidden cigarettes."" John mumbles, and then louder: ""Go get the toy."" 

 

""It's not here, John."" 

 

John's voice rises: ""Well, bloody look for it, then!"" 

 

They both gain some curious look and Sherlock continues with a loud whisper: ""A missing horse toy. How fascinating. You should write up your account of this excellent case, John."" 

 

John ignores him and turns to his daughter: ""It's okay, darling. Uncle Sherlock's got a plan."" 

 

""This is tedious. Looking for a toy. How did she even lose it? It isn't like the horse can run away. Although, I would understand the urge."" 

 

""Did you find it?"" 

 

""No."" 

 

John raises a challenging eyebrow that Sherlock finds incredibly unnerving: ""You're Sherlock Holmes and you can't find a baby's toy?"" 

 

""Why don't you go look for it, then?"" 

 

""Ooh, if I find it, I'm forever going to hold this against you."" 

 

""Well? Did you find it?""

 

""No..."" John looks around, eyes stopping on every child trying to spot the missing toy: ""But it's probably with some other kid now.""

 

Sherlock huffs and glares at his friend. He knew all of this was a bad idea. And he is always right. ""It is your fault that we are here. Now, your daughter can't even stop crying.""

 

""Stop complaining, you're making it worse."" 

 

The daycare lady appears next to them and addresses Sherlock with a worried look: ""Is there a problem here, Mr Watson?""

 

""Yes, it is entirely possible that one of the offspring here has stolen a toy from my friend's daughter.""

 

John swiftly finds his way between them pointing a finger to his friend:

 

""He's not Mr Watson.""

 

Sherlock ignores the sudden but fierce ache in his chest.

 

""Also, Sherlock, it's just ""children"" and maybe one of them just borrowed it. I'm sure she can find another.""

 

""If it is a horse she wants, then it is a horse she should get."" 

 

Sherlock reaches over to hold the baby's hand, and he hushes her quietly, trying to calm the heartbreaking cries. He can see John smiling fondly behind him.

 

""They're babies, go easy on them."" 

 

Sherlock shakes his head in displeasure: ""They are still thieves if they decide to take the horse from her. It is unacceptable.""

 

John simply laughs. A genuine sound that seems to surprise both of them. Sherlock frowns at him, he can't understand anything he does can make John so genuinely happy. He's been more and more genuinely happy around him these days.

 

""This is not a laughing matter, John! Your daughter is crying!"" 

 

John's eyes are shining so bright when he looks down at them Sherlock's breath catches in wonder: ""No, I know, I know, you just... you're so protective. It's... it's nice.""

 

""Now is simply not the time to be nice because I can spot the white horse in that child's hands. Excuse me."" 

 

Sherlock stands, a determined look on his face John recognizes to be one usually reserved to the worst criminals.

 

""Sherlock, no, no, no, no. Wait!"" 

 

Sherlock bends down to be eye to eye with the culprit.

 

""Hello. You are holding the toy that was initially with that child over there. Can you hand it over?"" 

 

""Sherlock, you can't just take the toy from him."" He glances around, taking in the increasingly mad amount of parents around them: ""Jesus. I'm sorry about my friend, he's just very... protective.""

 

Sherlock ignores him and grips the toy still in the child's hand.

 

""I can and I will. Now, give it.""

 

John can immediately spot the glossy eyes of the child and the rapidly increasing breathing as a storm coming and tries to take Sherlock away from the kid:  

 

""Look, you're going to make him cry! Let's just find her another toy, come on. There's a little sheep over there, we can try that."" He looks down at the child: ""I'm really sorry for my friend here, he's just, you know... trying to be a good parent."" 

 

Sherlock looks away: ""I'm not a parent. I'm a... concerned uncle.""

 

John gives his daughter back to Sherlock. He holds her carefully and she immediately curls up to him and stops crying. The soft hums she lets out as she leans on Sherlock lights a bright light in his chest. He feels like everything is burning inside him. When has everything become so warm? How did he manage to live when everything was so cold? 

 

""I think my daughter loves her concerned uncle very much."" 

 

""Oh, shut up, John.""

 

""You're enjoying this."" 

 

""Enjoying what?"" 

 

John's voice is so incredibly gentle when he answers: ""Being a dad."" 

 

Something unfurls and blooms in Sherlock's chest, growing around his lungs and flowering in his throat and in his heart. He softens again and holds John's daughter closer to inhale her familiar scent.

 

""I don't know what you mean."" He hides a smile behind the child's hair.  

 

John laughs and watches Sherlock put the baby down again to let her crawl to some other toys.

 

""This isn't so bad, hm? Just the two of us, watching her play."" John says as Sherlock stands up again beside him.

 

""I admit, this isn't entirely a traumatic experience.""

 

Sherlock and John watch the giggling child together, both of them are smiling proudly.  

 

John takes a deep breath and seems to ponder for a moment too long, Sherlock immediately tenses up in expectation:

 

""Remember when you said that your name was a girl's name?"" 

 

The world seems to suddenly come to a stand still. All noises around them muted but for the sound of Sherlock's own breath.

 

Sherlock clears his throat, trying to appear nonchalant as the walls of his mind scrumble, close to collapsing: ""Yes. What about it?""

 

""Was that really what you wanted to say?""

 

""John, that was months ago"" Sherlock sighs. 

 

""That didn't really answer my question. What did you want to say?"" 

 

Sherlock takes interest in the floor beneath their feet, in the colourful paintings on the wall, in the blue sky out of the window: ""It doesn't really matter now, surely."" 

 

John sees immediately through the feigned disinterest: ""Maybe it does. You don't know. We never really talked about it. It's been almost a year."" 

 

""You'd prefer to discuss this inside a daycare centre?"" 

 

John's eyebrows rase to his hairline in victory: ""So, there's something to discuss, then?"" 

 

""Yes, maybe there is. You should stop dyeing your hair darker.""

 

John touches his hair again: ""The silver hair thing is just weird. I feel older."" 

 

""It's not a bad thing. Everyone gets old. We've been dying the moment we were born.""

 

John gets closer to him, very slowly, almost imperceptibly, definitely deliberately. Their arms brush against each other.

 

""You're really not letting this go, are you?"" 

 

""Not until you stop dyeing your hair."" 

 

Looking far off the distance, Sherlock can still feel the look of his friend on his face, on his neck, seemingly avoiding his eyes, before stopping on his curly hair. He is not close enough and it still feels suffocating.

 

""It would suit you, you know? The full silver hair, not just the small ones."" 

 

""What, do you think we should switch hair colours now? Don't be absurd, John.""

 

""No, I think we should grow old together."" 

 

Sherlock is startled by the words, and he slowly turns to John who has a calm smile on his face as he watches his daughter. As if what he just said isn't momentous, as if what he just said is evident, as if it didn't shake Sherlock's whole world from its axis. Just them, the two of them against the rest of the world. Until the end. Sherlock stares at him with soft eyes, and with an even softer glow in his chest back yet again.

 

...

 

On the way home, Sherlock stays quiet and just carries the tired little girl in his arms. They reach Baker Street, and Sherlock puts the child to sleep. He rocks the crib as he observes her sleep, her small hands, her eyes, her little nose. His smile turns sad as he lets his fingers brush against her tiny head.

 

""I wonder what your name will be.""

 

He smiles before leaning down to kiss the top of her head lingering for a while. 

 

""Thank you for this wonderful day, Miss Watson. Maybe one day, you and I will do this again, my dear Watson.""

 

Sherlock takes in the room he prepared for her and stares longingly at the baby one last time before quietly closing the door and walking down the stairs. In the living room, he watches John standing by the fireplace, seemingly lost in his thoughts. Feeling the gaze of his friend on his back, John looks up to stare at Sherlock through the mirror.

 

""John, I've been thinking. Don't you think we've seen enough?"" 

 

John's expression is serene but curious as he turns around to face him: ""Enough of what?"" 

 

""Crime, danger. Solving cases. Do you think it's possible in the future that we would have seen enough?""

 

John frowns: ""You saying we should stop?"" 

 

Sherlock has never been the self-conscious kind but he feels the need to cross his arms to protect himself from being too vulnerable:

 

""Well, not right away, of course. I have been thinking about what you said earlier. When we're ready, maybe we can... go elsewhere."" 

 

John takes a step closer: ""Ready for what?"" 

 

""To be in content with each other.""

 

John's smile could light up the entire room: ""Alright, madman. Where should we go?"" 

 

""I heard that Sussex is a good place for cottages. Maybe I can garden, or become a beekeeper. Who knows?""

 

John laughs at the idea, and Sherlock smiles fondly.

 

""It's just a thought, John. Maybe an ordinary life won't be so bad. All it takes is a good companion."" 

 

""Sounds like a plan, Sherlock. I'll think about it."" 

 

""We still need to raise your daughter here. You have decades to think about it. I will wait. In any case, I've always wondered how to take care of bees."" 

 

""I was joking, Sherlock. Of course, I'd come with you. The two of us against the rest of the world, remember?""

 

Only there are three of us now isn't there, Sherlock can't help but think.

 

""So, back to what we were talking about earlier. Is ""Sherlock"" really a girl's name?"" 

 

Sherlock averts his eyes but he feels strangely at peace with the sentence now: ""I think we both know what I truly meant.""

 

John steps even closer: ""Maybe I do. Maybe it can be something that's only between the two of us."" 

 

Sherlock stares into the familiar deep blue eyes and sees everything he feels reflected in them: ""I wouldn't want it in any other way.""

 

Sherlock and John smile softly at one another. And it was enough for them both. No one else mattered. Only the two of them and the family they have made.

 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

 

''This was a nice change of scene. It should make up for the last one. You did put me in very weird clothes.''

 

Something deflates inside of Sherlock. He takes a look at his friend, and at the walls of 221B seemingly moving with a gentle sway, cradled by a continuous humming sound.

 

""Don't complain, John. Pretend it was Halloween.""

 

John laughs, and Sherlock smiles, something small and broken while watching the crinkles form at the corner of John's eyes.

 

His friend's smile is soft when he looks at Sherlock again:


 


""I had a lovely day, Sherlock.""

 

""I did as well.""

 

""But I think you have something more important to work on right now.""

 

Sherlock can feel the walls around him bounce again even as John stays unmoving. His throat tight, his voice a choked sound as he whispers, dejected:

 

""John... I'm sorry. I tried. I didn't mean to wait so long.""


 


""I know, but you can always come back here.""

 

Sherlock stares at John, an ever calming presence in the chaos of his complicated emotions. He feels a sting at the back of his eyes and realizes he can feel his own eyes fill with tears. Sherlock looks at the mirror to avoid John's eyes.


 


""I am never going to have this life, am I?"" he murmured.

 

John offers an apologetic smile, and he reaches over to take Sherlock's hands into his own. Sherlock looks down to focus on the hand on his. Storing away the feeling.


 


""It was a good run. You had all the details perfect. Even the teacher called us the Watsons.""


 


""Actually, it was Mycroft's enrollment. Seemed like something he would do.""


 


""See? Details. That's good storytelling. I think, as a storyteller, I would be impressed.""

 

Sherlock smiles ruefully at John, clutching their hands tighter, holding on to the feeling while it lasts. John sighs and he stands so close Sherlock can almost feel it on his face. He closes his eyes briefly.

 

""He needs you.""


 


Sherlock's head hangs low.

 

""I know he does, but every once in a while, I wish that he didn't. Things would be much easier.""

 

Even as he voices it out loud, he knows it to be a lie. John sees right through it.


 


""Would it?""

 

""No. No, it wouldn't. I need him to need me. It is the only way I can keep him in my life.""


 


""Well, then. Now that that's out of the way, maybe now you can work on trying to find stuffed animals better.""

 

Sherlock tearfully laughs and just stares at what he could have had if he stopped waiting. He feels the ghost of John's free hand on his face raking through his hair slowly.

 

""Come back to me, Sherlock.""

 

""I will miss you, John."" Sherlock sniffs.


 


""You don't have to miss me. You'll come back here, right?""

 

Sherlock shakes his head: ""No, I won't. I can't. Distractions won't be good. Not with the new crisis waiting for me out there. I need to protect them.""


 


""Well, in that case, maybe you'll find out what our daughter's name is.""

 

Sherlock's heart shatters a little more and he has to bring his free hand to his sternum to try and ease the pain.

 

""She's not our daughter. She will never be our daughter. She was never mine. However, she's half you. Mine or not, she's my family.""

 

John smiles at Sherlock, staring at the small silver decorating his detective's hair.

 

""Good luck, Sherlock. I hope you'll remember your vow.""

 

...

 

Sherlock opens his eyes and finds himself in an awfully familiar car. John and Mary are staring at him with a concern that makes something seize up in his throat. It takes him a few minutes to acknowledge John's hand is on his trying to gently shake him.


 


""You okay? You've been blabbering about a missing horse for a second there."" John asks, voice filled with worry.

 

He tries hard to ignore Mary's sceptical eyebrow: ""Those aren't the only things he said. I still think we should take him to the hospital, John. He could still be hallucinating or something.""

 

Sherlock stares at Mary and looks at her stomach for a moment. His heart drops, and he looks away.

 

For days, Sherlock was so sure he was to die in six months, which is why he did what he did... because Sherlock is the type of person who can never be killed by anyone except by himself. Now that he is back, the only thing he dreads is to watch John grow out his silver hair and raise his daughter with someone else.


 


""No, Moriarty's back. We should be prepared."" Sherlock mumbles, trying to regain some composure. He can't allow himself to be weak, nor to be vulnerable.

 

John's voice is too filled with concern to be described as angry: ""Are you even in a fit state? Look at yourself! How many times did you even go to that bloody mind palace of yours in the span of an hour?""

 

Sherlock stares at John, noticing how his hair is back to his natural blonde colour. Sherlock's chest twists but he flashes him the genuine bright smile he only reserves for his best friend.

 

""I'm fine, John. Have you done something new with your hair? You look marvellous.""

 

John brings a self-conscious hand to his hair and the gesture, so familiar, threatens to overcome Sherlock with the intensity of the feeling it causes. This longing again. He swears he can see a faint blush on John's cheeks.

 

""My hair? What... What are you on about? And, no, you're not fine. We should get you to the hospital.""

 

Sherlock ignores him once again and straightens up in the car, attempting to regain a semblance of composure.

 

""The stage is set, the curtain rises. Moriarty returns and chaos will soon follow. Now is not the time to daydream pathetically about what could have been.""


 


""What do you mean? Daydream?""

 

John's frown of confusion is at odds with Mary's somewhat suspicious and knowing look.

 

""Come along, John! We have a case to discuss! Moriarty's impatience will take effect soon. We shouldn't waste time.""


 


""Sherlock, please. Talk to me. How do you even know you're okay?""


 


""Because, John, between you and me, I always survive the fall.""

 

Sherlock winks because he needs to pretend he is fine, because he needs to pretend he is human, because he needs to pretend he is doing better. He exits the car and closes the door with much more force than expected. John and Mary share a confused look. John sighs, following Sherlock into 221B. Because that's what he does.

 

In the car, Mary frowns and her hand is securely placed on the bump of her stomach. The car starts rolling again and takes her to the home she and her husband share.

""John? John Watson?"" Mike says from the park bench he's sitting on. ""It's me. Mike Stamford, from Bart's. I know, I got fat."" He chuckles.

""Yes, hello,"" John says automatically, without registering who Mike was. His mind had been elsewhere, worry dragging him down even as the sun shined around him. Oh, Mike!

Recognition flickered across his face. Making a vague comment about the weight gain, he stuck out his hand. ""Been a while. Alright?""

""Same old same old. Working at Bart's."" Mike smiles and shakes John's hand. ""Teaching bright young things like we used to be. God, I hate them."" He chuckles. ""Last I heard you were off getting shot somewhere. What happened with that?""

""I got shot,"" John says tersely, his hand reflexively reaching for his leg, despite the wound being in his shoulder. ""Just got back, though I can't afford London. Not on an Army pension.""

""Couldn't stand to be anywhere else,"" Mike smirks and follows John to get a coffee and catch up.

""Mmm, Harry's no help either."" Pursing his lips John feels his pocket for spare change, then passes a few coins over to a vendor selling coffee and tea to other park patrons. ""Have you tried finding a flatshare? Impossible these days, not like in Uni.""

""You're the second person to say that to me today."" Mike takes a sip from his steaming cup.

""Second?"" Glancing in surprise at his old friend John follows Mike's lead and takes a sip from his still too hot coffee, burning his mouth in the process. ""Who else?""

Sherlock growls as he whips the corpse mercilessly, matching the speed, strength, and intensity as much as he could from the body at the crime scene. He looks up when the door opens, seeing Molly giving him that mousy wide-eyed stare.

Later Sherlock looks up when the lab door opens, seeing Mike Stamford come in with a man walking with a cane. ""Fancier than when we were here."" Mike chuckles.

John mutters something that even he couldn't discern and gave Mike one of those polite smiles you give when you bump into someone you vaguely remember at the grocery store.

He scans the room, noticing how correct Mike's words were. Back in his day, Bart's had been able to boast having all the best equipment, and it seemed that hadn't changed over the years.However, halfway through his inspection, he saw a man hunched over one of the tables, a dropper full of clear liquid in one hand.""Is that him?"" he wondered.

""Mike, can I borrow your phone? I can't get a signal."" Sherlock says, looking Mike and the mystery man over.

Mike feels his pockets. ""Sorry. Left it in my coat.""

""Uh, here, use mine?"" John said, offering before his mind had time to catch up to his words.The man walked towards him, his full height evident as he slid off the stool.

He wasn't wearing a lab coat, or the tattier clothing favoured by broke med students. Instead, he was in a two-piece suit, the collar a crisp white shirt hugging his chin.

The collar hid the man's neck from John, but he didn't have to look to know there wouldn't be a bite there. The man was oozing alpha, from the way he walked to the arrogant set of his shoulders.

John gripped his cane tightly in his hand while holding out his mobile as the man approached.Mike, an Alpha? Seriously? John thought, glancing furiously over a Mike who just smiled at him.

""Afghanistan or Iraq?"" Sherlock asks as he types furiously.

""Afghanistan, wait how did you know?"" John stared, mouth gaping open as the cold words hit him. It had been a common enough question in the army, soldiers sizing each other up, looking to see who had the better stories.

""How?"" He repeated, once again glancing over to Mike, wondering if perhaps Mike had given Sherlock a heads up. Mike shakes his head and raises his hands to show his innocence.

""Everything about you screams military. The way you walk, talk and breathe. When you entered you surveyed the entire room but not to see what had changed but for threats. You may be overly cautious but your posture and hair cut give you away. Your face and hands are tanned but it's less so under your cuffs and collar. Buttoned up tight somewhere with a lot of sun and military posturing. Mike made a comment that a lot has changed since your day so Military doctor then. Only two choices with sunny active military conflict, Afghanistan or Iraq."" Sherlock finishes sending his text and hands the phone back. He looks the man over, taking in the psychosomatic limp. Interesting

""If you'll both excuse me I have to go down to the morgue, left my riding crop."" Sherlock pulls on his coat and heads for the door. ""We'll look at the flat tomorrow.""

""Look at the flat? I don't even know where it is, or anything about you? I can tell you're an Alpha, but nothing else.""

John groaned as he glared daggers at Mike who smiles apologetically. ""I don't even have your number.""

""You know that I wouldn't be here if I didn't know what I was doing and that I wouldn't observe everything about you without quite the impressive intellect. You need a flat and I have my eye on the place. Together we should be able to afford it. The name is Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street. Good day."" Sherlock winks and he's gone.

""Yeah. He's always like that."" Mike chuckles.

""He's... intense."" John sighs, scratching his eyebrow. ""Bit off-kilter for an alpha to just take up lodging with someone, without... asking. Did you tell him?""

""Swear to god, I haven't said a word. That's yours to tell, not mine."" Mike said as they walked out of the lab together.

""Right... ta.""

Going to see the flat...

Sherlock pays the cabbie as it stops outside 221B the next day. ""Afternoon."" He says as he gets out of the cab. ""Found the place alright?""

""Mr. Holmes,"" John says, sticking out his hand in greeting. Inwardly he kicked himself. The omega in him knew that Alphas preferred it when Omegas didn't use first names, but John was no ordinary omega. He'd spent years tamping down his secondary biology and was not about to stop just because there was a tall, and admittedly gorgeous Alpha staring down at him.

""Please, call me Sherlock."" Sherlock shakes John's hand, feeling the calluses from well-trained hands. ""We'll be pretending to be a couple after all."" He says as the door opens.

""Oh Sherlock! Come in!"" Mrs. Hudson cooed and shuffled them inside.

""Wait wha-?"" John manages to squeak out before his voice and confusion is drowned out by who he could only presume was the landlady.

Much to John's dismay, they were led up a flight of old wooden stairs. Sherlock bounded up the steps with ease, but John and the older lady both took their time, finding Sherlock already flitting about the cluttered lounge.

""This is quite nice,"" John says, looking around at the clutter, pointing his cane at the fireplace in particular. ""Once we get some of this stuff removed.""

""I... I can tidy."" Sherlock starts to clean up piles.

""Sherlock says you're an army doctor. Thank you for your service. There's two bedrooms if you'll need it."" Mrs. Hudson smiles.

""Of course we'll be needing two bedrooms,"" John begins to say. A loud thud, Sherlock slamming a book down on a table, drew his attention to the Alpha. Sherlock glared at him, and it was only then that John remembered his words about pretending to be a couple.

""I uh, have terrible nightmares most nights. War, and all that.""

Narrowing his eyes he watches as Sherlock returns to stacking books and piles of papers.What the hell is that about? Pretend to be a couple?

""Oh good. It's much easier to rent to couples. Not having all kinds through the house all hours of the day and night."" Mrs. Hudson nods. ""The constant coming and going between unbound Alphas is astonishing. My home is not a brothel.""

""Tea, Mrs. Hudson?"" Sherlock asks as a diversion.

""Not your housekeeper, dear. Just this once."" Mrs. Hudson says as she heads to the kitchen.

Sherlock goes to John. ""The listing is for a couple because she is not able to keep an eye on singles anymore. And they are more likely to be destructive to the property. She's been considering having a hip replacement and I'd much rather be here to assist her without her fussing over it. So if you would please play along this arrangement is beneficial for both of us, John."" He whispers, his height looming over John, not in the usual overpowering aggressive alpha way but more of a protective shielding from everything else.

""You could have mentioned this earlier,"" John hissed though his words got caught in his throat when Sherlock whispered the monthly rent.

""I suppose I can try..."" God, it was cheap. Cheaper than the bedsit he'd been assigned when he'd returned to London. Between his pension, and whatever it was Sherlock made, surely they could afford the flat, with more than enough to spare for food. It wasn't ideal, lodging with an alpha. But John had suppressants at his side and a lifetime worth of ignoring alphas.

""It won't be that hard to pretend. I never bring anyone home and most people keep their distance from me anyway. We just live together. You get a cheap flat in central London and Mrs. Hudson lays off me to find a mate so I can focus on my Work."" Sherlock nods.

""And what work is that?"" John began to ask, but he was interrupted by the landlady who poked her head into the sitting room.

Just until I'm on my feet. John tells himself, moving a stack of papers from the seat a plush armchair he plopped down hard. With a sigh, he stretches out his bad leg and watches as Sherlock continues to flutter about moving one stack of belongings to another location without really cleaning anything up.

""Milk and sugar, Dr. Watson?"" Mrs. Hudson asks.

Outside a car pulls up as Sherlock watches out the window. The door downstairs opens and hurried footsteps on the stairs make their way into the room.

""Where?"" Sherlock asks as a man enters the flat.

""Brixton, Lauriston Gardens."" The man says.

""What's new? You wouldn't come to get me if there wasn't anything new."" Sherlock slips his hands into his trouser pockets.

""You know how they never leave notes? This one did."" The man says. ""Will you come?""

""Not in a panda car. I'll be right behind."" Sherlock nods and the man leaves.

Sherlock jumps around in glee. ""It's Christmas!""

John watches with mild confusion at the scene around him. The newcomer looked familiar, though he couldn't place where or how he would have seen the man. He'd only just arrived in London and hadn't been social.

Once they hear the door shut downstairs, Sherlock begins dashing about, muttering under his breath about ""Anderson, I won't work with him.""

""Make yourself at home, don't wait up,"" Sherlock says, twining his scarf around his neck then dashing down the stairs.

""Always dashing about. But you're more of the sitting down type,"" Mrs. Hudson says.

""Damn my leg!"" John shouts, frustrated with his own limitations. There was something intoxicating in Sherlock's energy that made him want to follow after the Alpha and see what the commotion was about.""

""Sorry... sorry,"" he mutters, though the landlady brushes it off and offers once again to make tea.

""Biscuits too, if you've got them,"" John calls after her, flicking a nearby newspaper open. There on the front page, beside a write-up of the serial suicides, is a picture of D.I. Lestrade, the same man who'd just been in the flat talking with Sherlock.

""You're a doctor. An army doctor. Seen a lot of injuries? Violent deaths? Bit of trouble too I'd imagine."" Sherlock pushes himself off the doorframe and walks over to John. ""Want to see some more?""

John stands, not enjoying the feeling of an Alpha he hardly knows looming over him. Sherlock had a few inches on him, but John knew how to make the most of his body.

Squaring his shoulders he forced himself not to step back when Sherlock encroached on his personal space.

""Enough for a lifetime,"" John replies, then adds, ""Oh god, yes.""

Sherlock smirks and sweeps out of the room, down the stairs.

""Sorry, Mrs. Hudson,"" John calls as he hobbles after the much faster man. ""Off Out,""

That evening is the most fun John had in years. It was even better than his first night in Afghanistan, though not having the constant fear of being shot by insurgents might have had something to do with that.

The evening flashed by, a series of vibrant memories that would stay with John forever. It ended with Sherlock being driven to a college, by the killer. A Taxi driver, no less. His profession allows him to blend in to any crowd.

Following in a separate cab, John has Sherlock's wifi-enabled laptop on his lap, with his mobile pressed to his ear. Desperately trying to get through the series of bored police officers stuck behind a desk.

""DI Lestrade, PLEASE."" John hisses, the urgency in his voice is evident. His heart felt like someone had gripped it with icy fingers.

Eventually, he gets patched through, and John's relieved the DI remembers him. He quickly explains the situation, ends the call, and reaches for the gun in his pocket. It's there, loaded, and ready to go. Not wanting to upset his cab driver, John leaves it where it is.

There are two buildings, both swathed in darkness with only a few lights on here and there by emergency exits. It's a 50/50 shot, and John hopes he's picked the right choice.

He isn't sure why he cares so much about this mad man, a stranger really. But there's something about the Alpha, perhaps just the promise of danger and adventure, that makes John want to hold the man close and never let him go.

John rushes through the empty hall, pushing open unlocked doors, shouting Sherlock's name. Urgency is the key here, not stealth. He chances to look out one of the windows overlooking the other building, the one he did not enter. And sees it.

Sees Sherlock. He's sat at a table, across from the cab driver. The distance is great enough that he can't read their lips, but he is able to see two vials laid out on the table and a gun in the cabbie's hands. John's heart all but stops beating in his chest, time freezes as Sherlock's name rips its way from his throat.

It's over before John has time to think about it. His gun is in his hands, he's used a nearby object to smash in the window. Taking a deep breath, he focuses, then pulls the trigger.

Sherlock rushes to the window as soon as the cabbie drops to see who the shooter was but there was no one to be seen. He goes back to the cabbie and presses his shoe to the man's wound. ""Who! Who is your patron!"" He demanded.

With the cabbie's dying breath he screams ""Moriarty!""

Finally, when he MET and paramedics show up Sherlock is led out. ""What is this? Why've I got this on me?"" Sherlock tugs at the shock blanket around his shoulders.

""It's for shock."" DI Lestrade answers.

""I'm not in shock."" Sherlock scowls.

""I know but some of the lads wanted to take pictures."" Lestrade chuckles. ""So what can you tell me about the shooter?""

As Sherlock is rattling off his deductions he stops, seeing John standing across the police tape looking as normal and ordinary as could be bit Sherlock knew he was anything but.

""Ignore me. Ignore all that."" Sherlock says and stands.

""What?"" Lestrade looks up from his boat road he'd been furiously writing in.

""You can't believe a word I say right now. I'm in shock. See, I've got a blanket."" Sherlock heads to John.

""Where are you going? We still need a statement!"" Lestrade scolds.

""I'll bring him in myself tomorrow. But he needs a meal and sleep. He was kidnapped by a serial killer after all."" John quips.

""Only a fool argues with his doctor,"" Sherlock says smoothly.

""Fine but both of you in my office first thing in the morning,"" Lestrade says as he watches them walk off.

Sherlock holds the police tape for John to duck under.

The gesture is kind and puts a smile on John's face even as Sherlock begins questioning him about powder burns on his fingers.

John's head is still swimming from the compliment *Good Shot*

It had been a good shot, a bloody good shot.

He falls into step beside the giggling Alpha as they leave the scene of flashing lights behind them.

""Dinner?""

""Starving,"" John replies easily, though part of him wonders if that is the *Alpha* talking, or the Man, Sherlock Holmes. He isn't sure which he wants to be asking, but he has a sneaking suspicion it isn't the purely male side.

Sherlock gets a call about multiples alpha bodies and an omega in the center of it all....

Sherlock was shocked at how easy it was to fall into a routine with John. He was worried living with another person would be catastrophic to his thinking not to mention the work but John was different. John made his mind sharper, thinking faster, deductions brighter. He hadn't felt this stable in years or as euphoric without the feeling of a needle piercing his flesh. This was different. He felt like he was soaring and falling all at once but it didn't matter if John was there watching and praising his work.

Sherlock heard Mrs. Hudson's footsteps come up to the flat and he rushed from the table to the couch where John was sitting. He lifted John's laptop from his lap and replaced it with his head, putting John's hand in his hair. He closes his eyes just in time for Mrs. Hudson to walk in with the mail.

""Oi, I was using that."" John grumped, hands still hovering in the air above where his keyboard had been. Instead, he found his fingers hovering directly over Sherlock's mop of curls. That's right, we're pretending to be a couple. This is what couples do.

Anxiety pierced through John at the contact. He was between suppressants. No longer able (allowed) to use the military-grade suppressants he had been on, he had to wait before swapping over to the generics from the chemists. He'd been careful, using special soaps aimed at hiding an Omega's scent, but with Sherlock this close, it was dangerous. Especially because he had no clue just how strong the Alpha's senses were.

With his own abilities repressed, John's sense of smell had been reduced to that of a beta. Normal, and dull, unable to smell Alphas or pick out their unique scents. It would come back, eventually, if he stopped his suppressants, but this had been his life for as long as he could remember.

Two things would happen if Sherlock found out.

One: He would be forced into a bond, simply because Sherlock's Alpha brain would kick in, and demand that the unbound omega finally belong to someone

Two: Sherlock would kick him out for legal reasons. Alphas were not supposed to lodge with unbound Omegas unless they were already bound, and for one reason or another, their bound mate couldn't produce children. Then, it was acceptable for an alpha to invite a second omega into their home, whose purpose would be to become a surrogate parent. (And quite often, more simply put a fuck toy.)

The thought of not being here, at baker street, made his heartache. In the months since moving in, he'd grown to enjoy the flat and the company.

""Morning, boys. Got your mail here."" Mrs. Hudson sets the mail on the table. ""Aren't you two the picture of domestic bliss?"" She coos as she sees them.

""John's proximity helps me think."" Sherlock mumbles, keeping up the ruse had been a bit of a struggle at first. But Sherlock had observed that John was settling into their arrangement which made things easier. He ignored how intoxicating it was to have John's fingers in his hair.

""You two are just so precious. Much nicer than Mrs. Turner's married ones I'll tell you."" Mrs. Hudson nods.

""Uhh, thanks?"" John says, wishing Sherlock's hair didn't feel oh so very soft beneath his fingers.

""Are her married ones... betas?"" He asks, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible. So far neither Sherlock or Mrs. Hudson had asked about his secondary biology, which had been a breath of fresh air, and he wondered if that was because he was in a mostly beta neighborhood.

Mrs. Hudson nods. ""Mrs. Turner says they're thinking of moving out. Want a bigger place to have a family. She says they keep her up all night, bed frame squeaking and all that."" She tsks. ""I'm so lucky you boys are so considerate. Barely heard a peep out of you. You know I take my herbal soothers in the evenings so don't let me be a hindrance."" She winks at John.

""Yes well, with the bedroom upstairs I imagine that helps keep things, erm, quiet."" John offers while willing his traitorous fingers to stop moving. But they don't, so he sighs and gives into it, at least for as long as their landlady is upstairs.

I should tell him that I'm an Omega. Before his prat of a brother finds out. I was promised it was all locked away, but who knows how high his clearance goes.

Instead, he clears his throat and pats Sherlock on the shoulder.

""Scootch,"" he says, trying to make his voice sound sympathetic like a lover might. ""Need the loo.""

Sherlock sighs dramatically but obliges, letting John up.

Mrs. Hudson chats with Sherlock about her next doctor's appointment while he tries to convince her to get the hip transplant.

John didn't actually have to use the loo. But he couldn't just sit there, petting Sherlock's hair and pretending to be madly in love. He'd noticed, while Mrs. Hudson had been drabbling on about the neighbours, that a faint scent of leather had reached his nose. His senses trying to come back online while in between brands of suppressants. Between the scent and the feeling of Sherlock's hair, he'd wanted to curl forward and bury his nose in the crook of Sherlock's neck. The Alpha smelled amazing, intoxicating even.

He wanted to lean forward and bury his nose in the hollow below Sherlock's adam's apple. He wanted to glide his nose along that sharp jawline, and those tempting freckles dusting across pale skin.

""Get a grip, Watson,"" he scolds himself, gripping the sink and staring at his reflection. His cheeks are pink, and heat prickles down his spine and between his legs. ""Good god, get a grip.""

Bending down he fishes around below the sink for his medical kit. Buried below all the gauze, bandages, and ointment is a disposable packet of a special deodorizer for Omegas. In itself, not rare to find in a medical kit. Should a doctor come across a wounded Omega, it would be commonplace for the doctor to use one of these wipes on the major scent glands before administering medical aid.

Pulling a single cloth out of the pack, he put everything away and quickly set about wiping himself down, focusing on his neck, armpits, and groin before flushing the cloth.

Just have to hope that doesn't clog... he thought, watching as the ancient toilet fought to suck the cloth down. But certainly, Sherlock has thrown worse down this old thing,

Sherlock was in the kitchen pouring some viscous liquid into the kettle when John came out, Mrs. Hudson had gone back downstairs. ""Mrs. Hudson asked if she should be expecting a happy announcement soon."" He rolls his eyes. ""I told her to hound you about it. You're better with relationship navigation anyway.""

""Great. Thanks..."" John sighs then stare at the kettle ""what are the chances that'll be safe for tea sometime this century?""

""It's dying anyway. This gives you an excuse to get that new one you've been eyeing at Tesco anyway."" Sherlock shrugs.

""So I guess I'll just go now, shall I?""

John sighs again, though honestly, the fresh air sounded good. He needed out of the flat, away from the confusing scents of Alpha. It was too early to retire to his bedroom, where he could throw a window open and air out the room. The last time He'd tried opening the windows in the sitting room (then he'd simply wanted to let in the fresh spring air) Sherlock had muttered something about dust, and promptly shut them again.

""Need anything? Might as well get a few things while I'm there, and if I'm bringing a kettle home, I'm getting a cab, rather than walking it.""

""Mm those chocolate biscuits. And tea. And honey, as many kinds as you can manage. Ask the butcher for organs from the bin as well."" Sherlock plugs in the kettle.

""I draw the line at organs,"" John grumbled as he grabbed his coat.

Only, once at the store, across from the butcher, he caved. The man, it seemed, was well aware of Sherlock and his habits and didn't hesitate in giving John a few bits and bobs.

""Pigs heart, random fowl innards, and a cow's eye,"" John announces once home. Sherlock is sitting in his chair, hands steepled under his nose deep in thought. John drops the wax paper bag on Sherlock's lap and takes the rest of the groceries into the kitchen.

He washes his hands, then puts the food away. At last turning to the kettle, he unboxes it, and gives it a good rinse, calling over the sound of the running water.

""This is for tea only, Sherlock. No experiments. Water, and tea. Understand?""

""Yes, yes fine."" Sherlock agrees as he looks through his goodie bag.

""You're welcome,"" John states, a bit dramatically though he isn't exactly sure why it was irking him that Sherlock hadn't thanked him. Or why he'd even caved and given into the Alpha's request in the first place.

He's an Alpha... And your body thinks it's about to have a heat. His brain warned, a part of him knowing that close proximity and coming down off medical-grade suppressants would be wreaking havoc with his hormones. I haven't had a proper heat in... Oh god, I can't even remember. Of course, my body is honing in on the first available Alpha it senses.

Sherlock takes the organs to the table and starts dissecting them.

""Takeaway?"" John asks, not even bothering to fight Sherlock for use of the kitchen. Not when he looks so much like a child on Christmas morning.

""I ordered Indian while you were out. Don't worry, I make sure to ask for extra naan."" Sherlock hums as he slices the heart open.

""Uh, thanks.""

""Is that what girlfriends do? Feed you up?""

No, you're looking into this too hard. He likes Indian food, he got it for himself and simply forgot to be selfish and not get me any.

""Right I'll just be.. upstairs, call me when it's here?""

Sherlock doesn't say anything, just continues scrutinizing samples under the microscope.

Risking Sherlock being too absorbed in his work to hear the doorbell, John heads up to his room where he promptly plops down on the bed, breathing in the scent of his bedding, willing the sweet scent of Sherlock to dissipate.

Three more days and I can stab myself with the new suppressant. Just have to make it through a few more days. Maybe Harry is free.

Sherlock gets the food when the delivery comes, pays the delivery man and bounds back to the kitchen. He places the bags on the counter then leans into the hall, calling up the stairs, ""John! Food!"" He waits, listening for John's footsteps, and frowns when there's no answer. ""John?"" He heads up to John's room, ""John, dinner is here."" He says, then notices that the bedroom door is cracked open.

The scents and sounds of London rush past John's ears. Petrol, ozone, pavement, scents from Speedy's... they all assault John's awakening senses. He'd forgotten it was like this, every scent seemed to come with a colour, every scent seeming to linger in his nostrils for hours after logic told him they'd long faded.

He focused on the scents from Speedy's, picking apart the various smoked meats he used in his sandwiches. Until a noise behind him made him pull his head in from the window and spin around.

""Dinner,"" Sherlock says simply as if finding his flatmate hanging out of a second-story window was completely normal.

Purple, his scent is purple. John realized, as the proximity once again brought Sherlock's scent front and center.

""Erm, yeah, be right down.""

Sherlock looks John over for a moment longer before turning and heading back downstairs, the gears in his mind turning.

I should take up smoking, or fake it. That way it appears I have a reason to hang out the window. John chides himself, taking his last breath of fresh air before heading back into the thick of it all.

Thankfully for John, Indian food was not known for subtle scents. Curry half-drowned out the natural scents of the flat, making it tolerable for John to sit across the table from the Alpha.Sherlock has ordered a butter curry, aromas of ginger and coconut rise up and make his mouth water. They divvy out the food, John taking a bit more Naan, and Sherlock extra rice.

""God, I'm starved.""

""I'm sure. You hardly touched your lunch today."" Sherlock hums as he eats, rarely eating himself but always noticing patterns about John. ""I hope it's to your liking."" He says, having picked John's favorites.

""Yeah well, after I learned you'd spilled acid on the table, the thought of eating my sandwich, which I'd prepared on the table, suddenly wasn't very appealing"" Instead of being angry, John laughs. Of all things to be worried about, accidentally ingesting acid was at the very least, interesting.

""I cleaned it up. You're just paranoid."" Sherlock shrugs but he's smiling. ""Mrs. Hudson still won't listen to me about the hip replacement. Will you talk to her? You're a doctor after all.""

""Surgery isn't easy, Sherlock. She'll get it when she's ready, and not a moment before. But, I can suggest a few friends in the field."" John adds, catching the faint smile on Sherlock's face. ""Best she can do is arm herself with knowledge, and make sure it's right for her.""

""It's a good thing we have a resident medical man then,"" Sherlock smirks.

Sherlock is halfway through his plate when his phone starts ringing. He gets up and answers. ""How many? Where?"" He asks, Lestrade calling with a new case.

Knowing that look, and those words, John devours the rest of his meal. When Sherlock was on a case, John was lucky to be given five minutes for a meal, and by how many he assumed there were multiple bodies, which meant Sherlock would want to be there five minutes ago.

""Excellent. We're on the way."" Sherlock hangs up and grabs his coat. ""John, case.""

""Sherlock, curry,"" John says, dipping the naan into the buttery sauce. ""You can wait five minutes for me to finish my meal.""

""Six bodies, John. And an Omega going into heat. Bring your kit."" Sherlock heads downstairs to get them a cab.

""Bloody hell...."" John mutters, wondering just how badly the cabbie would hate him if he brought the curry with him.

Instead, he hastily throws the covers back on the takeaway containers, pops everything into the fridge, hoping there wouldn't be any cross-contamination with Sherlock's organs, and dashes upstairs for his kit.

He exits the flat just in time to see Sherlock vanish into the back of a cab, and hurries forward to join him. The driver is Alpha, which is not uncommon. But between the two of them, in such close quarters, John begins to wonder if there won't be two Omega's going into heat at the crime scene.

John looks over in surprise when Sherlock unrolls the cab window once they start to move through the city. Once at the crime scene, Sherlock tosses the fare at the cabbie and gets out, heading right into the middle of the crime scene with quick strides. He holds up the police tape for John as he takes in the scene.

A small female omega was trembling with a blanket on and officers talking to her. Men and women, Alphas and betas, though Sherlock notices with annoyance that the team tonight is mostly Alphas.

""All unbound Alphas off this scene immediately!"" Sherlock snarls, grabbing Alphas one by one and dragging them off himself when they don't comply. ""John, tend to the woman. Please."" He says, seeing her covered in blood, though it doesn't appear to be her own blood.

John stands still, shocked at seeing Sherlock's full Alpha side unleashed. It rooted him in his spot until Sherlock gave him an order. He's amazed at how many Alphas simply listened to him, only a few lingered long enough for Sherlock to tear them away from the poor girl.

Why? Why does Sherlock want to be alone with her?

John, tend to the woman.

""Uh, yeah... yeah.""

Tightening the grip on his kit he hurries forward, getting as close to the Omega as he could, while still respecting her privacy. Glancing over his shoulder he sees Sherlock dragging the last officer away from the woman, and knows they're mostly out of earshot.

""Hi, I'm Doctor Watson... I'm, well, not a beta, or Alpha..."" He offers softly, watching as she looks up and tries to piece together his confession. It takes her a second, but the realization washes some of the fear from her features. John holds up a single finger to his lips, begging her to keep his secret, then crouches low.

""Are you hurt?"" He asks, still keeping his distance.

She shakes her head, confirming his initial suspicion. ""Did you fall?"" He asked, wondering if she'd been pushed into a puddle of blood. She nods once, but then amends it, shaking her head. Confused, possibly concussed.

""Can I come a bit closer?"" John asks, giving her a friendly smile. She hesitates for a moment before nodding again.

Sherlock makes sure Lestrade kicks the Alphas out before going back to the scene. He makes sure to keep his distance, not wanting to scare the poor woman anymore. He grabs a scent blocker out of one of the police kits. He rips open the package and slaps the patch on his neck. He gives it a few minutes to work before going to have a look at the scene. Six dead alphas, all executed.

Professional.

Sherlock goes back to John and the woman. ""Can you tell us what happened?"" He asks softly, making himself look as small and non-threatening as possible.

""You're fine, this close?"" John asks without looking at Sherlock.

Sherlock shoots him a look that says ""don't be stupid"" then promptly ignores him in favor of listening to the young Omega speak. Her words are broken and don't make much sense so they both wait politely until a team of paramedics arrives, then John pulls Sherlock aside.

""Are you bound? Is there an Omega in your life I need to know about? Because if not, getting that close to her could have been incredibly dangerous! Last thing I need to see is my friend on top of some Omega who's already gone through hell.""

""No I'm not bound. And I have a very good idea of what she's gone through. My body is a transport for my mind. It doesn't rule over me. I rule over it. She needed to feel safe and protected. You did that. You cleaned her up. I protected her from the other Alphas. She gave information that is vital that wouldn't have been without that secure feeling. Besides this bloody patch worked."" Sherlock rips the patch off his neck, a small rash on his neck from where it was.

""I don't care if she was an Omega or beta or Alpha. She was a victim and I will not let her be victimized further or let a murderer go free. I don't care about secondary biology other than if it's a motive for a case or not. Beyond that, it's all background noise.""

""Well, that was still dumb."" John hisses, unable to let go of his anger. He'd been warned that his body would attempt a heat between switching brands of suppressants, but he hadn't realized just how emotional it was making him. He kept just thinking That could be me, ready to go into heat, scared, trapped with an Alpha.

""Next time, warn me you have the bloody patch on, couldn't see it under your collar and scarf.""

John bites his lip then realizes he's still gripping Sherlock's elbow. He drops it, and steps back then motions to the bodies as if willing Sherlock to be anywhere but by his side where his scent and act of protectiveness were making his body beg him to skip the next dose.

""I apologize.."" Sherlock frowns, not liking seeing John so affected. ""You should go home and finish eating. I'm going to go to Bart's and handle the bodies with Molly. I'll probably be gone all night.""

John opens his mouth, about to cus Sherlock out for suggesting John go home. But his gut wrenches, and it has nothing to do with the carnage surrounding them.

Fuck

He begins to think. The flat is too far away to walk to, and being trapped in a taxi with an unknown Alpha wasn't ideal right now.

""I'll... come with you to Bart's, then make my way home from there,"" he says, hoping Sherlock wouldn't object.

Sherlock looks John over but doesn't say anything, only nodding and leading John to the body transport van.

They sit in silence. Sherlock thinking about whatever it was Sherlock Holmes thought about. While John considered dead bodies to be a step up from unknown Alphas who had the power to drive him anywhere, against his will or not.

He felt better, away from the chaos and blood. As his blood pressure went down, so did the symptoms he'd long since forgotten. By the time they made it back to the heart of the city, he almost felt normal, aside from his heightened sense of smell, and decided to at least stop and say hello to Molly.

Sherlock keeps an eye on John, wondering why he's smelling different. Perhaps it was his anger or the worry over the Omega. Could even be the dead Alphas affecting him. He follows John inside Bart's as the bodies are taken to the morgue for processing. ""We should get a treat for Molly from the cafe so she'll let us stay for the autopsies.""

""I'll go... cake? Cupcake?"" John asks, remembering there was a bakery just down the street. Sugar would help him, or at the very least it would satiate his emotions if only a little.

""Good. She likes the red velvet."" Sherlock nods. ""Get yourself something as well. We may be here for a while."" He pulls out a wad of bills from his pocket and hands them over to John before going down to the morgue.

""We?"" John asks himself. ""Not trying to get rid of me now.. why?""

He ends up buying three red velvet cupcakes, and a dozen chocolate-covered strawberries, knowing that even Sherlock wouldn't be able to resist at least one of the sugary fruits. He tucks the box under his arm and heads back into the hospital, feet carrying him through once familiar halls until he's in the morgue. Where the grandeur of the sweets is slightly lost among the stainless steel slabs, and the bodies laid out on them.

He places the parcel down on a table as far away from the bodies as he can, and leans against the wall, waiting for Sherlock and Molly to notice he'd arrived. However, the two were in a deep discussion, carried out in hushed tones, and so far neither seemed to know another living soul was around.

""Their scent glands are gone, Sherlock."" Molly mumbles.

""I can see that. Was it professional or sloppy?"" Sherlock asks as he looks with her.

""Professional..."" John sighs, having gotten near enough to hear.

""I've seen something like this before, and it isn't pretty.""

He pinches the bridge of his nose, sucking in a deep breath to keep his emotions stable. He didn't need another spike of his biology crippling him just because he got worked up.

""In Afghanistan, some insurgents had the brilliant idea that doubling their scent glands would double their strength. Think... when a barbarian goes into its berserk state in a video game or movie. We put an end to it before they had a chance to experiment, but they can't have been the only ones to have that idea.""

""Of all the superstitious pseudoscience."" Sherlock shakes his head.

""Are you alright, John? You look a bit flush."" Molly says quietly.

""Mm? Oh yeah, fine."" John waves Molly off, not even bothering to think of an excuse. ""Going to be here a while? If so, I might head home. Maybe have the flat to myself a bit, watch crap telly without Sherlock deducing it on me.""

""If you remember anything else from what you've seen of this before, text me,"" Sherlock says, pulling on gloves before touching the bodies.

 

""Oh cupcakes."" Molly smiles and goes to the box.

""I'll reach out to a friend, he dealt with most of it. If there's anything we're allowed to share I'll let you know."" John says, smiling at Molly, and remembering his cupcake before heading out.

""Maybe a bubble bath, but I'd have to scrub the tub first. That sounds nice... and some wine? And of course, this cupcake.""

""A nice relaxing evening."" Molly smiles and picks up her cupcake, taking a bite while Sherlock scoures the bodies.

Feeling a bit guilty for leaving Sherlock, John reminds himself that all he'd do, should he stay, was sit and wait. Per policy, he wouldn't be allowed to help, just like Sherlock technically wasn't allowed to help.

By chance or cosmic design, he flags down London's only Beta cab driver and makes it hope without any more spikes.

""I can feel you staring, Molly,"" Sherlock says as he takes samples from under the fingernails.

""Nothing just..."" she titters, ""he brought you chocolate. You can't tell me you didn't notice how flushed he was. If ever there was a time to bond, well, it would be soon. Sherlock. He'll be needing it. And, well, you tolerate him, as much as you do anyone else. More so even.""

Sherlock frowns and glares at Molly. ""What are you talking about?""

""Wine... bubble bath, crap telly. He's nesting. Honestly, for a genius, you're not always very bright. What else does he need to do, hang a neon sign over his head saying I'm going into heat soon, and would like to go home and be comforted by my Alpha because that's silly? Sherlock, very silly, they don't make those signs."" Molly says, shooting her friend a scathing look over one of the dead Alphas.

""Really, you Alphas act like you're the ones in charge when really, we hold all the power because you lot are too dumb to understand.""

Sherlock just blinks. ""I.."" he looks at the bodies. ""Call me when the preliminary results come in."" He whips off the gloves and grabs his coat, heading out the door.

""Yeah, no... I'll text. Don't need you answering the phone during that..."" Molly quips.

John's heat makes a surprise appearance...

Hey, Tindo here! Accident is asleep ;) Maybe some of you lovely people can surprise them with a comment or two for when they wake up?


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Alone in the flat, John breathes in a sigh of relief, though the feeling of relief doesn't last long.

Surrounded by the scents of home and Sherlock, his stomach twists and he can feel a once familiar dampness between his cheeks.

""Fuck."" he hissed, pulling his mobile out of his pocket he dials his contact on the local army base.

He paces for the ten minutes it takes to be connected, then growls into the phone. ""You miss calculated. It's starting, and I need something now not in three days. Fix this, I've had enough unfulfilled heats to last a lifetime, you were supposed to ensure I'd pass as a beta.""

His contact mutters something, and papers are shuffled about, then he's being offered a safe house for the duration, rather than the suppressants he needs now, not in three days. But he knows it's already too late, he's already past the point where medical intervention could help.

He's about to accept the safe house when the floorboards in the hall creak. He turns around and sees Sherlock standing wide-eyed in the doorway.

""There's always something.."" Sherlock says softly, looking John over. He makes sure to stand outside the door to the flat. ""Text me what you need and I'll make sure it's made available to you. I'll stay down in 221C and make sure no one comes in the flat to get you."" He gives John one last look before turning to go.

John ignores the man on the other end of the phone call and stares at Sherlock like a rabbit caught in the headlights for a moment before snapping back to attention

""Don't... go. I just want to take a bubble bath, drink some wine, eat my cupcakes and maybe have my hair stroked for once"" he blurts out before Sherlock can leave. ""Plus,"" he adds quietly, ""we're supposed to be pretending to be a couple, you staying downstairs isn't going to help that. One word and my CO can have me in a safe house for the duration. You can tell people my sister needed me, then we'll get this squared away... So it won't happen again. Unless... You don't want me back.""

The man on the other end of the line sighs impatiently, but John snaps at him, telling him he can wait a few goddamned seconds. He looks over at Sherlock, trying to judge if he'll still have a home in a few days.

""John, this is your home. You should feel safe and welcome here. Whatever you want or need all you have to do is ask and I'll make sure it happens."" Sherlock nods. ""You are indispensable to the Work and to me. You are free to leave any time you want but I will never force you out."" He says softly. He feels awkward and nervous. He doesn't want to upset John or cross any lines.

""I can go start the bath if you'd like?"" Sherlock offers, trying to show John that he'll do anything he can to help him.

John nods once at Sherlock, a small thankful smile playing on his lips. Thinking fast he addresses the man on the other end of the phone call. Ignoring his impatient growl.

""I'm staying home where a friend can protect me. However, you will drop off a vial of heat reducer, which you will hand to anyone who answers the door."" John hangs up, not giving the man time to argue or come up with a less pleasant option for him.

He hears water coming from the bathroom and snaps back to attention. Dashing up the stairs he grabs his most comfortable pair of pyjamas then heads back downstairs where true enough Sherlock is bent over the tub. John lingers in the doorframe, cupcake in one hand, pyjamas in the other.

""This wasn't supposed to happen. I'm in between brands... I think being so close to that omega set me off. Seeing her stress... Sorry... I'm sure you weren't looking for an Omega to flatshare with,"" he mumbles, trying to breach the awkwardness that had come between them.

 

""You don't have to explain anything to me, John. Technically I wasn't looking to flatshare with anyone but Mrs. Hudson needs someone to look out for her and this was her stipulation. If anything, being here helps both her and I a tremendous amount."" Sherlock shrugs as he adds fancy bath salts to the water as well as bubble bath.

""I.."" Sherlock stands and looks at John. ""Living with an Alpha, especially one as difficult to live with as myself, must be hard for you. I want to apologize if I ever made you afraid or fearful as such was never my intention.""

""Yeah..."" John starts to say, but stops and tilts his head. ""You... never made me feel afraid. Half the time, I think you forget you're an Alpha.""

""Gender itself is a construct and secondary gender is like a biological hostage situation. I try to ignore it as much as possible."" Sherlock huffs a small laugh. ""Check the temperature of the bath and I'll go open the wine? Red or white?""

""Biological hostage situation..."" John scoffs, stepping into the room and brushing past Sherlock to dip his finger into the water. ""Never before has a more apt phrase been uttered. I've spent my whole life trying to avoid my heats. Mm waters nice, and.. red? please?""

Without thinking about social expectations, or what would be considered proper, John strips and slips into the water while Sherlock is off getting the wine. He doesn't care when Sherlock enters the room and finds him mostly buried under a layer of bubbles, all he cares about is the relief the warm water has to offer.

Sherlock nods and goes to the kitchen, opening a fresh bottle and pouring some for John. ""Here."" He passes the wine to John. ""Is there anything else I can do or get you? Or I could leave you alone?"" He asks, never having had to take care of someone in heat before.

""Someone, probably in full military kit, carrying a metal ammo box, will be bringing over a vial of reducer for me. It should make it so at the most, I'm itchy and irritable over the next few days. If possible... just no smelly experiments until this is over?""

John wrinkles his nose at the thought of the reducer but doesn't voice his concerns about the medicine. It isn't ideal, but it's better than being in the throes of sexual desire for the next 78 hours.

""From an outsider's perspective, it'll appear we've swapped roles for a time. Me being the grumpy arsehole in the middle of an epic temper tantrum, while you play the role of 'its time to eat, John, you should bathe, John. John, why don't you change your clothes, you've been in the same pants for two days.' ""

Sherlock chuckles softly and nods. ""I suppose I can play nanny for a few days."" He teases. ""What does it feel like? To be in heat?""

John sits up a bit and reaches for the wine, then changes his mind and grabs the cupcake instead.

""It's a bit like,"" he says around a bite, sending crumbs into the water. ""Watching a really bad porno, where you just can't look away no matter how badly you want to. Like feeling every cell in your body turn to lava for days on end unless sexual gratification is met. It's always been bad for me, I was told they'd get easier once I was an adult... but.."" He shrugs and meets Sherlock's gaze, unaware of just how weird it was to be having this conversation naked, in a tub, with an Alpha looming over him. ""Too many years suppressing it, I guess, kind of ruined it for myself.""

""That doesn't sound pleasant at all."" Sherlock leans against the sink. ""Does spending a heat with a partner help?""

""Don't know. Never have."" John says around another mouthful of confectionary heaven. ""Threat of an unwanted bond, when my body literally can't say no. Doesn't sound pleasant to me. I'm more than my biology, more than a man capable of bearing children. I refuse to let some sod bond me and stick me at home to raise his.. or her... pups.""

Cupcake gone, John sinks back down into the water, letting the wine sit for another moment.

""I should warn you, me living here... guess it could put you in trouble. I'm registered as an Omega, of course. But the military made a few exceptions and had all that buried. Still, you being an Alpha... you'd have to sign ownership of me.""

Sherlock scowls. ""I don't want ownership of you. If anything you're the more reliable and more stable one in this flat. You should have ownership over me if anyone was to own anyone."" He rolls his eyes and sits on the floor, his back leaning against the tub.

""You are your own person. A highly skilled doctor and a veteran. You shouldn't have to struggle for personhood like this. It's archaic and deplorable. The only thing that comes out of it is abuse and unhealthy relationships. My mother knocked my father up. They were dating sure but they hadn't even discussed marriage. Then Mycroft was born so of course, they had to do the right thing and bond."" He makes a gagging noise.

Sherlock sighs and leans his head back against the edge of the tub. ""I'll do whatever I can to make things easier for you but I will not do anything legally binding without your full knowledge and consent."" He turns his head to look at John.

""Pass me a flannel?"" John asks after a long stretch of silence.

Part of him knows this should be weird, having Sherlock so close. However, he can't deny that Sherlock's company, in itself, is comforting.

""Dad's an omega then..."" he muses, accepting the flannel and dipping it into the water before wringing it out and placing it over his face. Humid warmth washes over him and he lets out a happy sigh.

""Not many of us out there, at least not out in the open. It's harder nowadays when the world has a picture-perfect idea of what masculinity should look like, and bearing children isn't part of that picture.""

""My father came from a poor family. They were basically destitute but he was an omega so he could have his pick of whatever suitor he wanted. My mother is from a wealthy family and she's a mathematician. Quite brilliant in fact, her work has changed quite a few fields."" Sherlock relaxes, the humidity of the bathroom and John's scent calming.

""Father was a photographer. He took some of the most breathtaking photos I've ever seen. Then after having Mycroft he became allergic to the chemicals used in the developing process. I don't think he ever really forgave mother for getting him pregnant. Especially after he wouldn't develop his own work anymore."" He frowns.

""Mm biological changes after a male Omega's pregnancy are not uncommon. Your whole body changes, the testosterone you naturally make all but vanishes during pregnancy. I can't imagine it was easy.""

The flannel has gone cold, so John drags it off of his face and reaches for the wine.

""My mum was the Omega, so it was a bit easier on her. Harry lucked out, got the Alpha trait while I'm stuck like this every few months. It was half the reason I joined the military. The suppressants they have are far superior to anything you can get at the local chemist. They rendered me identical to a beta male. Only clues would have been my own physical appearance, not that I let anyone see.""

Warm and comfortable, John lets out a small sigh. The tightness in his body is no longer clawing at his every nerve. ""The case then? Do you know who did it?""

""I have an idea but I need more data first. The Alphas had surrounded that woman because they smelled her heat. Someone took them out. The interesting part is the scent gland removal."" Sherlock hums, eyes closed.

""Mm, well if anyone can figure this out, you can.""

John sipped his wine and was silent for a long moment. That could have been him surrounded by Alphas, it had been once. He knew the fear she must have been feeling.

""Glad she's safe.""

""As am, I."" Sherlock hums. He could tell that John's scent was becoming more pronounced but it didn't bother him in the way most Alphas seem to be bothered. If anything it allowed him to categorize all of John's smells. He wanted to know everything about John.

""I'm going to... Erm, finish up here."" John said after a moment. ""Someone should be by soon. I should be able to manage the injection on my own, but I'd rather not open the door myself. Would you mind answering?"" Finding himself wanting to stare at the back of Sherlock's neck, he warms the flannel and places it back over his eyes.

""Of course."" Sherlock nods and gets up, his long limbs stretching him off the floor. ""Is there anything else I can order you that you may need? Certain food? Entertainment? Toys?""

John laughs out loud at that. Simply thinking about Sherlock walking into an adult shop and buying the largest Alpha cock dildo the store has to offer almost makes this whole ordeal worth it.

""No. If the reducer will take away the worst of those urges. Thank God. I might be a bit more munchy, but mainly out of boredom than anything. Snacks could be good. But don't go out of your way.""

Sherlock tips his head as if confused. ""What was so funny?""

""You buying me a dildo.""

John begins to laugh again, then with a wave of his hand says, ""what are friends for, if they can't help you shove a synthetic cock up your own arse.""

""I've bought a dildo before, John. It's not a very complicated process."" Sherlock rocks back and forth from his heels to the balls of his feet. ""And if it could help you I wouldn't think twice about it.""

""Yeah, but buying one for yourself is one thing. It's not exactly the most common gift."" John peels back the flannel and grins up at Sherlock. The doorbell rings before either of them get a chance to say anything else and Sherlock excuses himself to answer the door.

""Well, when I woke up this morning I didn't think I'd be soaking in a bubble bath with an Alpha sitting beside me."" John mutters to himself as he clambers out of the tub and towels off.

Sherlock answers the door seeing a man standing there just as John had described. ""The medication?"" He holds his hand out.

John is dressed in his cotton pyjamas and is walking out of the bathroom by the time Sherlock comes back upstairs. He rolls his eyes at the armoured box containing the single vial and motions towards the table. Sherlock sets it down and watches as he opens the box.

""Will it be an issue, watching me? Triggers an all that,"" he asks, pulling out a hyperdynamic needle. He rips the packaging off of it and wastes no time in piercing the cap on the vial.

Sherlock shakes his head. ""Haven't had cravings in a while."" He rips open the alcohol wipe packet and holds it out to John.

""Right, just making sure.""

Thanks to the warmth from the tub he finds a vein easily. After cleaning the skin with the wipe he injects the yellowish liquid into his system then purses his lips.

""Do me a favour, watch me for the next twenty minutes. I haven't had this yet, so don't know if I'm allergic. Keep an eye out for cognitive slips, hives, or shortness of breath."" Slipping the needle out of his body he paces the cap over the sharp end and tossed into the bin.

""I'll make tea,"" Sherlock says and goes to the kettle. Once he has it filled and turned on he pulls out his phone, fingers flying over the keyboard.

John half wants to ask if Molly has texted yet. The case would distract him from the ache of desire and longing to be pressed up against an Alpha, strong arms holding him close while he buries his nose into dark curls.

Fuck. Not any Alpha. He starts, realizing that the faceless alpha in his fantasy wasn't as faceless as it had once been. Now Sherlock's elegant curves replaced the once blocky shape, pale skin and sharp eyes replaced the once fuzzy face.

""I'm... Going to curl up on the sofa."" John mutters, shuffling past the Alpha he now shared a flat with. ""One sugar, please. I crave sweet things when I'm like this.""

""Mm."" Sherlock hums and nods, not looking up from his phone. When the tea is ready he makes it and brings John his mug as well as a package of biscuits he knows John secretly likes when he's not feeling well.

""No signs of allergic reaction yet, the worst would have kicked in by now."" John says, watching Sherlock's fingers fly across the front of his phone. ""case stuff? Do you need to leave?""

""Mm? No. Placing an order."" Sherlock says as he looks at the list of items. ""Do you prefer milk or dark chocolate?""

""What?"" John lifts his head and glances over at Sherlock in puzzlement.

""Dark or milk chocolate. I've seen you enjoy both. I'll get both."" Sherlock hums, sipping his tea as he adds more things to the order.

""You're being nice to me..."" John says when half his tea is gone. He can't recall the last time Sherlock was voluntarily nice to anyone. Even when buttering up a client, the act slipped the instant it was no longer needed. Yet, something told John this wasn't an act. ""Why?""

Sherlock squirms a bit, looking uncomfortable. ""I want you to stay here at Baker Street. Most people can't stand being around me longer than absolutely necessary and yet you live here by your own volition. You're indispensable to the Work and to me. And I'd rather have you comfortable and safe with me than out there. Alphas are disgusting horrendous creatures. If I could be anything else I would."" He looks at John.

John sighs and props his back up against the arm of the sofa, stretching his feet out over the cushions.

""I was afraid you'd ask me to leave, if you found out. I've been careful, soaps, and scent neutralizer clothes. I think seeing that Omega in stress set me over the edge. I was worried that if I accepted their offer of a safe house, I'd come back to find you gone, or my things on the pavement.""

""Never, John. This is your home just as much as mine."" Sherlock promises.

""Pass me the blanket from my chair?"" John asks, curling up on his side with his back against the cushions.

The contents of the vial were making him drowsy.

""Just.. going to nap a bit.""

Sherlock gets the blanket and lays it out over John. ""I'll be here if you need anything.""

""Ta,"" John mumbles moments before slipping off to sleep.

Dreams during a heat were typically far more vivid than normal dreams. John imagined they were meant to make the omega wake up already gagging for it. But instead of the faceless Alphas hovering around him as per normal, he dreamt of Sherlock sitting by his head, running those long fingers through his sandy hair.

Sherlock watches John sleep for a bit before sitting on the edge of the couch, gently threading his fingers through John's hair. John had mentioned that this would help so he thought he'd try it. He places the order that should arrive by the time John woke up.

John is a whore for bubble baths, what can I say?

Sherlock finds some ways to help John with his heat..

The sitting room is empty when John wakes, but a soft rustling of bags from the kitchen tells John he's not alone.

Focusing on his body he's pleased to find that, while still sensitive and desperately longing for a good solid hug, his heat hasn't progressed any further.

He yawns and stretches, finding a pillow had been placed under his head while he slept.

""Oh good, you're awake. Put this together."" Sherlock brings John a box with a collapsible projector screen inside.

""Uhhh..."" John mutters, running a hand through his strangely disheveled hair.

Sherlock doesn't give him time to think about it. He simply thrusts the object against his chest, leaving it to John to make sure it doesn't clatter to the floor.

He sits at the table, staring at the mess while trying to figure out how to put the box together.

""Did you buy out Gregg's?

""Hardly, John. They just have a larger selection on the website."" Sherlock hums as he dumps out bags of snacks. He puts them away where they go and then starts working on the larger bags. He puts away the bathroom supplies, bath bombs and bubble bath.

""No one has ever done this for me before,"" John says softly, watching as Sherlock moves about.

""I... Thanks...""

Sherlock nods stiffly. ""I... I was sent to an alpha and beta boys boarding school when I was a child. I presented late which they teased me mercilessly for. One day another boy who they thought was a beta went into heat. He just so happened to be assigned my partner for a project. We were in the library and he was sweating and trembling. Then they came.. I held them off for as long as I could until the professors could arrive. I was sent to the hospital with a concussion and multiple fractures but they didn't lay one finger on him.""

""Uh.. wow."" John says, thinking back to his first heat and how terrifying it had been.

""He was lucky to have someone watching out for him. Not everyone is so lucky. And in a mixed school, god...""

""I was suspended for fighting. The others were let off with a warning because they were following their instincts. I was a freak who didn't want to rape my helpless classmate."" Sherlock shakes his head.

""Yeah well, it's not legally classified as rape, now is it..."" John says bitterly, ""It's our own damn fault for being out in public like that. Here... I think this is done?"" He holds up the box for Sherlock's inspection.

""But that's what it is. I don't care what name it has."" Sherlock takes the box and pulls the handle and the projector screen rolls perfectly. ""Excellent."" He takes it out to the living room and stands it up, unrolling the screen. He goes back to the table and unboxes a mini projector.

""Did you get popcorn?"" John asks, trying not to sound too hopeful as the pieces began to fit together. It was a pain moving their tiny tv so they could both sit comfortably on the sofa.

Clearly, Sherlock had some sort of movie night planned, though his idea of entertainment was usually a documentary on ash, which to him was something along the lines of a comedy.

""Obviously, John. What kind of heathen do you take me for?"" Sherlock scoffs as he pulls out an air popcorn popper from another bag. ""There's also an assortment of flavorings from sweet to savory to once that I find strange to put on popcorn."" He hands John the box of flavorings before taking the popper out of the box.

""Mmmm sweet for me""

John isn't quite sure where to place the box, so he placed it on the coffee table, then on a whim climbs the stairs to his room and comes back with half his bedding in tow.

""Should we warn Mrs. Hudson? Though the more I think about it the more I imagine she'd be thrilled to learn I'm an Omega.."" John says, claiming half the sofa as his with his various pillows and blankets then climbing into his makeshift nest.

""I told her that you weren't feeling well and not to come up so she doesn't catch anything. It is your information to give if you wish to do so."" Sherlock plugs in the projector and hands John a new weighted blanket while it turns on.

""Ta,"" John says to both Sherlock's words and the blanket. He replaced one of his thinner blankets with the new one, sighing as the weight settles around him

""Oh, this is heaven.""

""Good."" Sherlock smiles, he had done research on how to help an omega through their heat without sex. ""There is also a new heating pad should you need it. The last one caught fire."" He hums, not admitting he was the reason it had gone up.

""Very flammable, those heating pads,"" John grins, curling up into a tight little ball. ""So which documentary are we watching today?""

""No documentary today. I was thinking something more to your liking."" Sherlock hooks up the Bluetooth from his laptop to the projector. On the screen appears the title page of a Bond movie.

""Oh!""

With the popcorn ready they each fix themselves a bowl, John option for a sweeter flavour while Sherlock goes for something a bit more normal.

""Thanks,"" he says again as the opening song begins to play.

""Not a problem."" Sherlock hums as he munches on a handful of popcorn.

John makes it through half the movie before his eyes begin to get heavy from a mixture of the medicine, comfort, and a full stomach.

Propped up on a stack of pillows he begins to doze off waking every few minutes, or when the action gets too loud.

Eventually, the volume doesn't matter. Without thinking about *who* was beside him. He gave in to the basic desire of human connection. Pushing all but one of his pillows aside he plants the final pillow square on Sherlock's lap then curls up with the back of his head pressed against Sherlock's stomach.

Sherlock stills, letting John do as he pleases. He gently pets John's hair and lowers the volume of the movie.

The credits have long since ended, the screen black when John finally wakes up.

It takes him a moment to remember that the reason the surface below his head is warm is because it is Sherlock's lap, not his bed.

He sits up and finds Sherlock silently watching him.

Instead of mentioning the obvious, his falling asleep on an Alpha, he sleepily asks, ""Anything from Molly?""

""The alphas samples came back and they were all dosed with a slow-acting paralytic."" Sherlock hums. ""I'm starting to think they may have been lured to that alley.""

""Lured that close to an Omega in heat..."" John hisses, ""was she a plant... Or?""

""I don't think she was involved with whatever scheme was going on. She may have just been a convenient coincidence. Her terror and fear were genuine.""

""Check my phone, see if my contact got back to me on his findings in Afghanistan, if you haven't already,"" John says around a yawn. 'I need the loo.""

Sherlock nods and gets John's phone, looking for messages.

John finds Sherlock engrossed in what he assumed to be the email and curled back up on the sofa.

""Let me guess it's a photocopy of a report and almost all the words are redacted.""

Sherlock frowns and nods. ""Redactions never make sense to me. Knowledge is knowledge. It's just a hindrance to the truth."" He hands John back his phone before getting his laptop. He logs into the MET server using Lestrade's login so he can search for similar cases of scent glands being removed.

""Maybe your brother can get the original copy?"" John offers around another yawn.

""Think I'll turn in. Erm. Thanks for the movie night, and the snacks. And the bath, ""

It takes him a moment but he gathers up his bedding and heads for the stairs.

""Oh, I read that having familiar scents helps. Would you like some of my clothing?"" Sherlock asks, looking up from his laptop.

""Ummm....""

John stops at the door and tenses for a fraction of a second. Sleeping with Sherlock's clothing hadn't been even in the far reached of the back of his mind. But now presented with the offer, he found he didn't want to refuse.

""Would you mind?"" He said carefully.

""Of course not."" Sherlock nods as he stands and starts to unbutton his shirt.

""Oh. I thought you'd get a new sh... That works too."" John stammers watching as each undone button revealed a bit more of Sherlock's skin.

He found himself contemplating what it would be like to nuzzle along Sherlock's chest when he felt the familiar clench in his stomach.

Sherlock passes John the shirt, he has some scarring from failed experiments and fights, silvery scars over his pale skin.

""That must have required stitches..."" Shuffling the shirt, and the pile of bedding into one arm John reaches out and runs a finger along a scar just across the left of Sherlock's chest.

""Mm pocket life."" Sherlock nods, relaxing under John's touch.

""Yours or... Oh.. the Omega in the library,"" John guesses while wondering how it's possible that such a simple point of contact could feel as good as it felt to be touching Sherlock.

""That's right,"" Sherlock says softly, gently taking a step closer. He lists what different scars are from. He pushes his hair to the side, a scar on his scalp. ""Had to have a hole drilled to ease pressure on my brain.""

The close proximity is making John's head spin. Both physically and mentally.

""I had a suspicion that you are human..."" He murmurs, ""but this is proof. What's this one from?"" John traces the small scar at the corner of Sherlock's lips, a feature that instead of hindering Sherlock looks added.

""Another junky head-butted me when his stash went missing. He thought I stole it but he'd used it up."" Sherlock mumbles against John's fingers.

John lets his finger drop, worried that if he didn't his stomach would clench with desire again.

""I've just got the one really, and an appendix scar. I mean a few odds and ends here and there, but nothing as heroic as some of yours.""

""Most of them are stupid accidents."" Sherlock shrugs.

""They usually are... Right. well... "" John nods towards the stairs then catches a pillow before it slips to the floor ""goodnight, Sherlock.""

""Goodnight, John."" Sherlock nods and goes back to his laptop.

Up in his room, John hastily makes his bed then plops down, face first, nose buried into the soft fabric of Sherlock's shirt.

""It's just your bloody heat talking. Get a grip. He doesn't like you, not like that.""

Sherlock spends the night working on the case.


John wakes up the next morning with Sherlock's shirt held closely to the side of his face. He's pleased to find his heat hadn't progressed over the night, but annoyed to find he was still on the verge of wanting a wank followed by a bottle of wine, then another wank. He slides his hand down to the waistband of his pyjamas but stops short of touching himself. It doesn't feel right, masturbating with Sherlock's scent cloying at his nostrils. Surley there was a line that shouldn't be crossed about fantasising over your flatmate, even if he were an Alpha. 



Sherlock is downstairs making breakfast, a full spread for John to enjoy. He had done more research on Omega's overnight in-between casework. Through such research, he'd learned that nesting usually came hand in hand with comfort eating.



""John!"" Sherlock calls up. ""Breakfast is almost ready.""



John's hand slides out of his waistband with a snap of elastic. He groans and sits up. Half wanting to remain curled up under his pile of blankets, while the rest of him wanted to find out what Sherlock considers breakfast to be. The growling in his stomach wins, and without changing into fresh pyjamas, he heads downstairs. Leaving Sherlock's shirt spread out on top of his pillow.



Sherlock has all of John's favorites on the table. ""Research says that heats can lead to increased appetite.""



""Mmm, did you sleep, or did you spend up all night researching Omegas?"" John says sleepily, slumping down into a chair and wincing when his extra sensitive rear end hits the hard surface. John tucks in, and despite his grumbling, a smile creeps over his face at the array of food.



""Thanks,"" He says, reaching for a plate and loading it up with greasy breakfast foods.



Sherlock nods and eats a piece of bacon. ""That and the case. Oh here."" He gets a cushion and hands it to John to pad the chair.



""Anything new with the case?"" John asks while stabbing a sausage with his fork. He brings it to his mouth and pops the end in, sucking off some of the juices before taking a bite, and repeating the process with the rest of the sausage until it's gone.



Sherlock is distracted for a second before speaking. ""I found a few similar cases where the scent gland was removed but the paralytic is new. Someone with access to medical-grade chemicals.""



""Might be hard to track down. More people than you know have access to medical-grade chemicals... I mean, even pharmaceutical reps have access, in small quantities. It's amazing what they're allowed to carry on them.""



He snags a pancake, and takes a bite, humming in pleasure to see Sherlock had gone for the sweeter, American version of the breakfast. Sherlock hands him a bottle of syrup, which John slathers onto the meal, then licks his fingers clean.



Sherlock's chest feels warm as he watches John eat the food he prepared. ""John, you may be on to something."" He pulls out his phone.



""Mm? Of course, I am. I'm smarter than I look. Bloody army surgeon, not some GP.. Have you ever tried operating on someone while IEDs are going off around you?"" 



John smiles warmly, the food and Sherlock's apparent interest in his input on the case puffing up his feeling of self-worth. He'd known for quite some time that his 

love language

 was a mixture of words of praise and touch, and in the last 14 hours, he'd had a plethora of both.



""Wouldn't want anyone else performing surgery on me in a war zone."" Sherlock chuckles. ""Your experience and knowledge is very useful.""



""Keep saying that, it's nice."" John jokes, finally setting his fork down after devouring half the food on the table. ""You should eat something.""



Sherlock picks at John's leftovers. ""Quite a few of our cases wouldn't have been solved without your knowledge and social skills.""



""Go on..."" John says, leaning back in the chair and grinning wide. ""Kidding, you don't have to. Are you going to head out today, hit the pavement, and solve the case? I should be alright, as long as you lock the doors behind you.""



John thinks for a moment then asks, ""Well, I 

think 

I'll be alright. I can't smell myself... is it bad?""



Sherlock nods. ""You smell like you're in heat. I'm still waiting on some more information so going out isn't strictly necessary as of yet.""



""Shit, I can go wash up with that soap...""



John stands and stretches. He doesn't feel like he's in heat, a bit flushed, sensitive, and his clothes felt too restricting. But all in all, he felt normal like he'd just spent too long in a sauna and his body was still tingling from the heat. Once he'd worked the kinks out of his shoulders he brought his plate to the sink and headed down the hall, intent on a quick shower and a thorough scrub.



""You don't have to. It doesn't bother me."" Sherlock shrugs. ""It's up to you.""



John shrugs and continues down the hall, where Sherlock's scent was strongest near his bedroom.



""The thought of not wearing clothes is pleasant enough that I find I want a shower. Might test the hot water limits, so if you need hot water, get it now.""



""I got some bath bombs as well if you want another bath,"" Sherlock suggests. ""Anything I can do?""



""I'm alright,"" John assures Sherlock, disappearing into the bathroom. This time he shut the door, but took care not to shut it hard.



While the thought of another lazy bath with good conversation and company was tempting, he wasn't certain his body would allow him to keep it just that, pleasant company.  He breathed a sigh of relief the moment his clothes were off his skin, and stepped into the shower, pulling the curtain in tight so the steam wouldn't leak out.



""First things first... I'm going to have a bloody wank and see if that helps get this out of my system."" He muttered to himself, while stroking his hand down his stomach and cupping himself.



Sherlock cleans up breakfast and puts away the leftovers. He goes back to the living room and looks at the notes he has pinned to the wall.



The shower and wank are wonderful, but neither help alleviate John's level of discomfort. When the hot water starts to run out, he scrubs himself clean, opting for Sherlock's soap rather than his neutralizer, then steps out.



Dressed in just his pyjama bottoms, figuring there was no point in being uncomfortable in front of partial nudity, seeing Sherlock had sat in on his bath, he wanders out of the bathroom and curls back up on the sofa, watching Sherlock work.



""Here."" Sherlock hands John a black nondescript bag as he tacks some new notes to the wall. Inside the bag were a few different sex toys.



""Mmm... Thanks.. I guess?"" John says, blushing a bit when he saw the contents. Placing them on the floor beside the sofa he reaches for the weighted blanket and pulls it over his lower half, dragging it up to his ribs. ""Trying to avoid that, if possible. Sometimes scratching the itch just makes it worse.""



""As long as you're not suffering."" Sherlock shrugs, frowning as he looks at the wall.



""Suffering, no. Annoyed and slightly uncomfortable, yes."" John says, thinking about the Omega cowering in terror the night before. ""Trust me, I have it easy right now compared to her. Her terror will only amplify her heat, unbound as she is... she'll be lucky to.... Sherlock!"" 



John sits up, and reaches for the nearest phone, and begins poking at the keys.



""What if we're looking at this from the wrong angle? What if this was never about the dead Alphas, but about the Omega? She's going to need to be bound this heat or else her heat is going to be intolerable. Favorable, for an Alpha who's been trying to win the favour of an Omega who isn't interested.""



He taps out a quick message to Lestrade, asking who the paramedics were who'd taken her, and where she'd been brought to.



""All that Alpha had to do was orchestrate the right scenario, and make it so he was there when she needed him the most. Taking their scent glands might have been for fun, or just to throw us of the trail.""



""Oh. 

Oh John!

 You're brilliant!"" Sherlock grins. ""A savior complex. Saves her from the Alphas and then disappears so she can receive medical attention. We need to know where she is right now.""



""Sherlock..."" John says after a pregnant pause. He gets up, leaving the comfort of his temporary nest, and places both hands on either of Sherlock's arms.



""Be careful... I mean it. We're not completely defenseless, in our heats. Just like your scent has the ability to drive me nuts, Omegas can control their ability to bring an alpha to their knees. Seduction at its finest.""



He says, not realizing his slip, inserting Sherlock specifically into the scenario, rather than a generic Alpha. ""I could, with a single thought, have you on your knees with lust. Boost my pheromones purposefully to blind you with desire. It's temporary, and only enhances the Alpha's abilities and strengths in the end. But she could be using it to keep him away from her. She might even use it on you if you waltz in as her knight in shining armor. Better to bond with a Savior than the man inflicting so much stress. Might be best to send a beta in, or...""



He chews his lips for a moment, considering if he could trust Sherlock with the information, ""there's a group, a society of people whose goal is to aid omegas. Alphas like you who have no desire to cave to social standards of fuck, breed, then fuck some more. They pair a needy omega up with an Alpha, who will bond with them, then leave forever. I'll send you the details, they might be able to help, though she isn't capable of making a decision like that right now...""



He meets Sherlock's steady gaze, feeling the intensity of it and realizing his thumbs had been brushing small circles over Sherlock's arms.



Sherlock watches John intently, feeling his strong hands on him. ""Do it. Do it, John. Show me what I'd be up against."" He wanted to know how an omega could affect others and he needed to know the extent to which it could affect him.



Sherlock takes half a step closer, his chest pressed to John's as he rests his hands on the omega's hips. ""I need to know that I can resist it. That the Work isn't in danger of biological impulses. Please, John. You must show me.""



""Sherlock,"" John says, instilling a slight growl into his voice, ""I don't think you understand what you're asking me to do. It ramps up your instincts, you have displayed incredible control, but what if this breaks that? I don't want to be the reason you go against everything you've fought for.""



John takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He can feel the warmth of Sherlock's chest against his own bare skin and the fingers wrapped around his waist feel like branding iron.



""Cuff me to a chair then."" Sherlock's warm breath brushes against John's temple. ""I'm used to temptation, John. My entire existence and fraught with desire and temptation and addiction. Give me some credit."" He noses as John's hair lightly.



""No, not a chair, too easily moved. The radiator in the bathroom.""



John says, after a moment of thinking.



Sherlock goes off to get the cuffs, leaving John missing his presence mere centimeters away from him. Gathering himself for what he was about to do he squared his shoulders and met up with Sherlock in the bathroom.



""Not even going to ask why you have these,"" he murmurs, taking the cuffs from Sherlock and attaching one end to the sturdy radiator. ""Wrist, please. And remember, if you pull this will hurt you, not the radiator.""



Sherlock offers his wrist to be cuffed. ""Nicked them off Lestrade when he's annoying. I've been cuffed to a radiator before. I know the drill."" He smirks.



""Git..."" John smiles, despite himself and what he's about to do. ""You're... uh.. going to get hard, sorry.""



Sherlock shrugs. ""It happens occasionally. I ignore it and it goes away soon enough.""



""Hope you're right.... Do me a favor, reach out as far as you can? I need to make sure I'm not in danger of being grabbed.""



Sherlock reaches out as far as he can, pulling on the cuff and showing John the range of his reach. ""That's as far as I can go without gnawing my own hand off.""



With the back of his heels pressed against the side of the tub, John nods and sits on the edge.



""Sorry... in advance."" Casting Sherlock a single apologetic look he closes his eyes and focuses.



It's been years since he's had to do this, and while unpracticed, it's a trick any Omega can call up instantly. It's like taking a triple dose of ecstasy, but instead of being the one feeling the effects, he's the satellite.



He knows his pheromones have changed, growing more potent with the heady promise the scents carry with them. Sherlock's eyes instantly go wide and his nostrils begin to flare.



""Like this, Sherlock, I could say anything in the world. I could be telling you that you have a troll sized booger hanging out of your nostril, and all you'll hear is sex, sex sex.""



He wiggles a bit, the change making his body believe it would finally learn what it's like to be with an Alpha during his heat, something he'd denied himself his whole life.



""Can you talk still? Tell me how you're feeling? It takes a minute for it to kick in. Your body has to absorb my scent, then I can play with you.""



Sherlock breathes deeply, John's scent and pheromones washing over him. He closes his eyes and drops his head as he tries to focus. His cock filling out in his tight trousers. ""It's.. it."" He swallows. ""It's strong.""



""Yeah, sorry, there's no dial. Just on or off. It's mean to help us overwhelm an Alpha. Sometimes used for mutual fun, but mostly to escape tough situations. We can do it even when we don't have a heat, but it just dazes and confuses an assailant.""



Watching Sherlock's eyes, he waits until the pupils start rapidly narrowing then enlarging again.



""Right about now, you'll be feeling the full effect. Which means my words mean nothing to you.""



John shrugged and found himself wondering if Sherlock's mind was still intact if he could still deduce and read him as plain as a page in one of his mystery novels.



A low growl fills the room, making the hairs on his neck stand, and an electric shock rolls through his stomach.



It had been far too long since he'd heard an Alpha turn their attention on him, and here on the cusp of this strange heat, his body craved it.



John stands from the edge of the tub and inches closer, inhaling the Alpha's scent and letting his eyes flutter shut.



Notes of rich leather, honey, and caramel fill his nose and he lets out a low mewling sound.



""You.."" Sherlock shows his breathing. ""You can touch me, John. I won't touch you back."" He licks his lips. ""You're in charge. I'm at your mercy.""



""If I touch you, you won't like what happens next,"" John whispers, his mouth watering at the very thought of burying his nose in the V of Sherlock's groin.



""Your control is astonishing, but mine wouldn't be quite as impressive.""



Closing his eyes he focuses for a moment, then shudders as the warmth is sapped out of him. He's left feeling hollow and worn out, like a pair of ratty jeans that have managed to avoid the garbage bin far past their prime.



Placing the handcuff key on the floor he kicks it towards Sherlock then flees the bathroom, heading to his bedroom, giving both himself and Sherlock space while they sort themselves out.



Sherlock sits on the floor for some time, eyes closed and head down. Eventually, he reaches for the key and lets himself out of the cuff. He goes and stands at the bottom of the stairs. ""John? Are you alright?"" He calls up to John's room.



John has his hands down his pants when Sherlock calls up to him.



It doesn't feel right answering him, while his scent still lingered and fueled his fantasies, but the alternative was Sherlock walking in on him under the guise of checking on him.



Only, it wasn't a ruse, was it? Over the past day, Sherlock had displayed over and over that some part of him cared. Mr. I don't do sentiment had suddenly decided to show his heart. From the junk food to the blanket, to simply being willing to listen.



Sighing, John calls out ""Fine... go save her, Sherlock.""



Sherlock hesitates for a moment before getting his coat. ""If you need anything call me immediately. Mrs. Hudson won't let anyone in and if they try she's armed. I'll be back as soon as I can."" He races down the stairs and out the door.



John finishes his guilty wank, then cleans up, despite knowing Sherlock would be able to smell it the moment he walked back in the flat. In desperate need of fresh air, John drags every stitch of bedding he owns over to the window, throws the window open as wide as it can go, and curls up into a ball on the floor below it.


Sherlock finishes a case and Mycroft is a prick.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Hours later Sherlock comes home. He was sore and there was some dried blood smeared over his face but the woman was safe and the case was solved. ""John? I'm home."" He says as he takes off his coat.

Unable to sleep, due to his body feeling as if it were on fire, every ounce of him screaming for an Alpha, John is awake when Sherlock gets home. The nearby church bell rings two in the morning, and Sherlock's scent (stronger now that he's home) wafts up the stairs. Mixed with it is the vile scent of another Omega in heat and a coppery undertone.

John knows that scent well, it haunts his nightmares. Red blood dripping from men he was trying to save. The mixture of scents has him on his feet before his brain has time to catch up with his actions. He slithers, more than walks, down the stairs, every one of his movements betraying him as an Omega, rather than the soldier he'd become.

He finds Sherlock in the kitchen, turning the kettle on. Sauntering up to Sherlock he takes Sherlock's face in both hands and begins twisting it up towards the light, inspecting him for an injury.

""Yours? Or... hers.."" He growls, wondering how so much blood found its way to the corners of Sherlock's mouth. Anger boils up in him, imagining Sherlock's teeth sinking into the neck of someone. Someone else. Not his neck.

""Clam yourself, John. No one is bonded to me."" Sherlock says softly as he relaxes into John's touch. ""I went to the hospital to see her. While I was there the Alpha that's been stalking her hit me over the head with a bedpan. Fortunately for me, it takes more than that to knock me out. A fight broke out. He tried to strangle me as he slammed my head against the floor so I grabbed him by the hair and pulled him down, ripping his scent gland out of his neck with my teeth.""

John only hears half of what Sherlock said. His mind swimming and heart singing knowing that Sherlock was still unbonded.

""Sit,"" he orders, gathering himself. Placing a hand on Sherlock's shoulder he pushes him into one of the chairs. He hurries into the bathroom to retrieve his medical kit. The cuffs still dangle from the radiator, reminding him of Sherlock leaning against it. The outline of his cock hard and heavy against posh trousers.

Without realizing it, he mentally flips the pheromone switch. Then heads back out to the kitchen where he begins cleaning Sherlock's face with a warm cloth, dabbing antiseptic on the tiny scrapes he finds in Sherlock's pale skin.

""You should get tetanus, and rabies shot, if you aren't up to date. You probably ingested some of his blood, and who knows if he's clean or not.""

""Yes, John."" Sherlock closes his eyes, relaxing. ""I'll have my brother send someone to give me the jabs."" He mumbles, he spreads his legs, and tugs John a bit closer by his hips so John can reach him better. ""He was obsessed with her. He's been leaving her flowers and gifts inside her flats no matter how many times she moves. Apparently, he'd also been orchestrating scenarios where he could save her."" He hums as he rubs John's thighs.

John sighs, his body relaxing as Sherlock's fingers brush over the thin cotton of his pyjamas.
The simple act of providing care calms him, until he forgets his panic over thinking Sherlock had come back bonded. When he's done, and Sherlock's face is no longer stained crimson, he finds he doesn't want to step away. With Sherlock sitting, he's taller than the Alpha. Looking down, he stares at Sherlock's lips, licking his own lips, wondering what it would be like to simply lean forward and taste his mouth.

Sherlock looks up at him, reading his face. ""Let me have a shower and we can cuddle on the couch if you would like."" He says softly, seeing the stress and worry on John's face and how his presence eases that.

""Sofa is too small..."" John says, growling when Sherlock eases him back so he can stand. ""Your bed is bigger.""

Without allowing himself time to think, he heads down the hall, this time nudging the door at the very end of the hall open, entering the Alpha's domain. Sherlock's bed waits, like a life raft promising him warmth and safety.

He can tell by the dip in the pillow which side Sherlock favours, so he pulls back the blankets and climbs into the other side, nuzzling his nose against the bedding. It smells like Sherlock and soap. Heaven to his aching body. Muscles he hadn't realized he had been clenching begin to relax as he curls up on his side, facing the other half of the bed.

Sherlock goes and showered, scrubbing the rest of the blood off himself. Once he's clean he gets out and dries off before going to his room to get dressed. He lets the towel fall to the floor before pulling pants on and then his sleep flannel bottoms over them. ""Comfortable?"" He asks John as he texts Mycroft to send someone with the shots.

""Mmm, sheets are soft,"" John slurs while rubbing his face across the pillow. ""mine are all scratchy."" They smell nice too, like you.""

""Good."" Sherlock nods and gets into bed, relaxing on his side. ""How are you feeling? Have you eaten?""

""I can't recall the last thing I ate... but. I'm not hungry. The body sort of shuts down goes into hibernation mode. 'Specially for males, you don't want a lot of food in your system during a time you're supposed to be having nonstop sex.""

The blankets shift as Sherlock gets in. They slide and expose John's back to the cool night air. He tugs a corner close, then finds he has to nudge closer to Sherlock if he wants his back completely covered.

""When my shots arrive I'll make you some tea and toast."" Sherlock relaxes and turns towards John.

""Mm, just tea,"" John says around a yawn, shifting in the bed until his forehead is pressed against Sherlock's shoulder. ""I think I've turned the... thingy on, can't... remember ... to turn it off,"" he says brokenly, fighting off sleep.

""It's alright. Just relax."" Sherlock gently wraps his arm around John, holding him close.

John lets out a soft whine at the contact. Sherlock's bare skin is damp and still smells like his soap, the same soap John had used on himself earlier.

""I... this feels nice,"" John whispers moments before giving in and letting sleep take him.

Sherlock holds John, nuzzling John's hair. They stay like that for half an hour before Sherlock's phone vibrates. He reads the texts that his shots were there so he slowly gets up so he doesn't wake John. He goes downstairs and rolls his eyes when he opens the door. ""Mycroft.""

""Not a beta after all,"" Mycroft says, sniffing the air and frowning. ""Shall we expect a happy announcement by the end of the day?"" Mycroft points to a man, a beta underling, and points to the case Anthea is holding.

""A warning would have been nice, I might be older than you, but I still am an Alpha... his scent is... weak though. Not a full heat?""

""I wasn't expecting company. We'll do the jabs here."" Sherlock presents his arm to get it over with. ""He's taken care of it himself. I'm just here to make sure he's safe.""

""Mmm always the hero,"" Mycroft says, watching as his underling administers the shots. ""Taking care of more than one Omega in one night. Some might call that brave, but you know what I think.""

""You make your opinions known far and wide."" Sherlock sneers.

""Yes well, not everyone requires shots at half three in the morning, brother mine,"" Mycroft says as he turns around and heads back to his car, underlings following at his heel.

""I'll be by in a few days with the paperwork, he is unregistered, you know.""

""He won't sign anything under your pressure and I won't force him."" Sherlock snaps.

""Then fudge the details. Make it look real. Misspell a name, I don't care, Sherlock. It's to protect him as much as it is you."" Mycroft stops and turns back to his brother.

""What happens if he gets hurt while following you around London? Hmm? They won't treat him without an Alpha's consent, and that Alpha has to have claimed ownership of him. Worse yet, what if someone finds out he still has his service gun? Think about it, Sherlock. Both of you. I'll give you a few days.""

""I don't need your protection."" Sherlock snarls and slams the door, going back upstairs.

Sensing the change in mood John lift's his head and frowns at Sherlock when he comes back to bed. Sniffing once he wrinkles his nose.

""How was your brother? Annoying? Please tell me he was wearing a nightgown with one of those funny sleep hats that dangles past his chin.""

""No nightgown could cover his oversized arse,"" Sherlock grumbles as he tries to get comfortable. ""He was talking about you being unregistered.""

""Mm... 'strue. Military overrode my familial ownership. I was given a year to find an Alpha after being sent home... Technically I'm a ward of the Army, until then."" John says, instantly seeking out Sherlock's body for comfort once more.

Sherlock cuddles John to himself again. ""It's your choice. Whatever you need to do.""

""They need proof of a bond, or I get assigned a random Alpha,"" John mumbles, nuzzling his nose along Sherlock's neck. ""Don't want that. And I don't want to think about it right now. I just want to sleep right now.""

Sherlock growls softly, the thought of John being bonded against his will irritating. ""I won't let you be shipped off.""

""Not your usual case, and I can't pay well."" John yawns then slings his arm over Sherlock's stomach. ""Night, Sherlock...""

""You're not a case. You're my friend."" Sherlock holds him. ""Goodnight, John.""

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

The sun is well up when John finally wakes. There's a warm body beneath him, the rise and fall of their chest indicating that whoever his bedmate is, they're still asleep. John's cock is hard and aching, and over the course of the night, his pyjamas had grown damp with slick. He groans and nuzzles into the warmth, inhaling the calming scent of Sherlock.

Oh shit... Sherlock. John's eyes flash open and he half sits, wincing as his damp clothing sticks and slides uncomfortably across his arse. Sherlock is asleep, stretched out with one arm folded under his pillow, a typical Alpha sleep position. The other arm rests gently over John's lower torso. Thinking back, John vaguely remembered cleaning Sherlock's face, then crawling into bed.

Sherlock mumbles, his arm tightening around John's middle when he feels him move. Tired from the fight he had slept soundly. The slight fever from the injections made him not want to stay in bed.

As Sherlock sleepily pulls him back down into the cocoon of blankets, John finds he doesn't want to get up and flee for his bedroom. He and Sherlock had entered into the flatshare under the false pretense of a relationship. Since Sherlock had found out he was an Omega, all John could think about was what would happen if it wasn't a false relationship... what if it were real.

Laying his head on Sherlock's chest, his forehead brushes against Sherlock's cheek. He's warm, and out of habit, John feels the injection site. Warm, but not dangerously so. It's just the medication taking its course. He'd have to make sure that Sherlock drank plenty of clear fluids, and ate at least one solid meal, but he'd be fine by the end of the day.

Sherlock relaxes once John is against him again. He slept for a while longer before finally waking. ""Mm morning, John."" He mumbles, he had a slight headache and needed a coffee. ""How are you feeling?"" He rubs a hand over his face.

""Bout the same as yesterday..."" John shrugs then lies just a little, ""Don't think I'm any worse. You look like you've gotten into a fight or something. Caffeine, paracetamol, then lots of water today. Over exerting yourself in the fight means that today your muscles are breaking down toxins.""

They both lay there for a moment longer. Neither man willing to break apart. Neither of them willing to admit just how much they enjoyed the closeness. After a while though, John's situation made things difficult. His cock wouldn't soften, and the damp between his cheeks was only growing worse. Though he was loathed to move away from Sherlock's embrace, unsure if he'd ever be allowed to be this close to the Alpha again, necessity required him to change and use the bathroom.

""I erm... need a change of trousers... and for you to look away so I can get up without completely embarrassing myself.""

""Mm, I'll make coffee."" Sherlock nods and lets John go before getting up, shuffling out to the kitchen. ""Do you not remember last night?"" He asks, filling the coffee filter with a few scoops of coffee.

""Bits and pieces..."" John admits softly, following Sherlock through the kitchen. He felt grateful that Sherlock doesn't turn around, giving him privacy as he heads up to his room.

""I'll be down in a moment... fresh clothes.."" he says haltingly, heading up to his room where the window is still wide open.

Shutting the window he strips out of his soiled bottoms and slips on another pair of old and well broken in pyjamas. He'll need a shower, and by now those sex toys Sherlock had bought him were starting to sound appealing, but for now, he wanted tea, and just a few minutes to enjoy the lazy morning.

Sherlock waits for the coffee to drip, meanwhile, he decides to make toast. ""Which pieces?""

Sitting on the chair with the cushion, John thinks. ""I remember the movie and snacks. Then there was the whole handcuffing you to the radiator. Not sure I'll ever forget that."" He frowns a bit.

""You left... and I don't remember what I did, but my bedding is under my window, which suggests I was attempting to get fresh air. ""You came home late, then... there was blood, and judging by the bruise on your face it was yours?""

""Some of it."" Sherlock nods and sets a plate of toast in front of John with butter and jam so he can make it how he likes. He pours them both a coffee and tells John what happened the night before. ""The face you made when you smelled Mycroft on me was priceless."" He snorts.

""If I recall...."" John says around a smile, ""He smells like lemons that have been left out in the sun for too long."" John slathers butter, then jam, onto his toast and nibbles around the edge, eating the crust first. ""She's alright then? Did my contact help? Or was there another option?""

""It went as well as we could have hoped."" Sherlock nods. ""She'll be alright. Your contact is going to make sure she has somewhere safe and secure to stay.""

""Mm good.""

John shifts on the chair, wincing as another trickle of slick dampens his seat. ""I hate this part..."" He groans, pushing his half-eaten toast aside and laying his forehead on the table.

Sherlock frowns. ""I got some absorbent pads as well if you need them.."" He says softly, not wanting to upset John.

""Not sure I can tolerate pants right now... but if this gets any worse I'll have to suck it up.""

""I'm going to go lay down..."" Taking one final bite of his toast he picks up his mug and carries his coffee into the living room, where he promptly curls up on the sofa.

Sherlock finishes his coffee and cleans up from breakfast. ""Is there anything I can do?"" He asks, sipping a fresh cup of coffee as he walks into the living room.

""Bond me, fuck me, knot me, and make this all go away..."" John quips then winces as a wave of cramps hits.

""Cuddling helped, but I don't want you trapped in your bed all day. You're probably already sick of being cooped up with me""

""Ask me when you're not in the throes of a heat."" Sherlock snorts. ""What if I drag the mattress out here and we can watch something on the new projector?""

""Wouldn't it be easier just to move the projector?"" John grunts, then reaches for the heating pad Sherlock had bought for him.

""I'm not the genius here, but that makes more sense.""

""We can open the windows out here so you can get more fresh air."" Sherlock counters and sets his coffee mug down before plugging in the heating pad.

John grimaces at the living room. It would take a bit of effort to move everything in order to fit the mattress, but Sherlock wasn't wrong. Fresh air would help, and the two windows out here, versus the one they each had in their bedrooms, would allow for better circulation.

""Yeah, alright... Just, let me help?""

""It's fine. I'll just roll you onto the mattress."" Sherlock moves the furniture around and brings the mattress out, setting it in front of the couch so they could sit with their backs against the couch if they wanted. He opens the window, letting the fresh air in. ""Ready when you are.""

""Stubborn git,"" John grumbles, though the smile on his face lets Sherlock know he's anything but grumpy. ""We should watch something you like this time. What about unsolved mysteries?""

""Alright."" Sherlock smiles and gets them both some water and settles onto the mattress.

Joining him, John instantly curled up on his side, his head finding Sherlock's chest and finding it the perfect pillow. While Sherlock searched for something for John to watch, and him to shout at, John thought back over the last day and a half.

Since taking up the flatshare they'd been forced to pretend to be a couple. That meant going out of their way to touch each other as a couple might in front of Mrs. Hudson. Gentle touches, or passing brushes of hands against arms as they passed each other.

At first, it had required thought. But within a few weeks, John had found he did it automatically. He'd even noticed the jolt of excitement he'd feel when Mrs. Hudson would come up for a visit, and Sherlock would gravitate closer to him.

Now, knowing what it felt like to have Sherlock's arms around him, holding him tight, and sleeping next to the man. (Okay, sleeping on top of Sherlock, if he were being completely accurate.) John wasn't sure those casual touches would be enough for him anymore.

""I can't remember... real or a dream, Mycroft mentioned something about me needing to get registered again?""

""Unfortunately real."" Sherlock sighs. ""He has to stick his fat nose into everything. Especially where it doesn't belong. He's worried about me getting into legal trouble."" He rolls his eyes. ""I'm not even worried about it.""

""But I am. We both could face some serious problems... Did he tell you that I can't get medical care, emergency or otherwise until I'm registered? I can get the basics through the army, of course... but."" John shrugs against Sherlock's chest and sighs.

""I'll have to figure something out. Been toying with calling that number I gave you. One call, they'd pair me with an Alpha who would bond me, and then we'd never see each other again. He'd get all my legal requests, and just sign off on everything. Not ideal, but it's better than a forced bond where I'm stuck living with them.""

A deep angry growl slips from Sherlock's throat before he can stop it. ""Sorry.."" He apologizes, not having meant to growl like that.

""Mmm don't be sorry, I rather share that sentiment,"" John says gently while inwardly his chest puffs at the rich sound. It was nice to have someone angry on his behalf. Normally people just gave him a pitying glance and placating words of apology.

""What if.."" Sherlock starts and then stops, thinking. ""What if you registered with me?""

""Could do... but they'd need proof of a bond. Not sure how we'd get around that mountain of a detail."" John nudges his nose along Sherlock's chest, ""though... it isn't the worst idea. Quite possibly my best option. If I ended up in the A&E, that'll probably mean we were on a case, and you'd be by my side anyways. On hand for any paperwork.. so to speak.""

Sherlock nods. ""We could fake it. Prosthetics for a bond mark."" He rubs his fingers through John's hair.

""What if I don't want to fake it"" almost slips out before John clamps his mouth shut and just nods. Sherlock's offer was quite possibly the best offer he'd ever receive, and he didn't want to ruin it by scaring his friend off.

""Hit play,"" he says instead, leaning into the feeling of long fingers dancing across his head.

""I.."" Sherlock blinks. ""I've never thought about having an Omega but if I did I'd want one like you."" He says softly as he presses play.

""Mmm.."" John hums, opting for pleasant but noncommittal. He wants to turn around and press their chests together, then their mouths. To taste those lips that so often speak harsh but brilliant words. Instead, he focuses on the cheesy crime show and settles for nuzzling a bit closer, adjusting the heating pad so it covers his stomach.

Sherlock talks back to the show about how they're all idiots and wrong while he gently massages John's scalp. ""Honestly I don't know how any crime ever gets solved unless the perpetrator is standing there red-handed on film with eyewitnesses and holding their confession.""

""Greg would love that,"" John says with a laugh, then suddenly he's curling up and whimpering. His stomach cramps, deep shooting pains that go from his ribs to his groin, he feels like he's being flayed open. Slick oozes out of him, leaving him feeling undignified and wrecked as he struggles to think past the cramps.

Sherlock frowns. He rolls John onto his stomach and makes sure he stays in the heating pad. He moves behind John and massages his lower back. ""It's getting worse, John. Tell me what to do.""

""Not sure... my body is fighting back. It's been..."" He whimpers a bit and tries to think, ""ten years since my last heat. Not enough is known about Omega's who suppress their biology long term. It just... isn't done.""

John grits his teeth through the cramps and laughs pitifully, ""I'd be an interesting case to study... you should take notes.""

John suffers and Sherlock tries to make things better...


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

""You're not a subject. You're in pain.""Sherlock says around a frown, ""Should I get the toys?"" He begins massaging John's back and hips. ""You feel so tense.""

""God no. They're a last-ditch effort. But at this rate, I'll be out of clean clothes by the end of the day..."" Grunting John does his best to focus on Sherlock's fingers. ""That... helps.""

""I'll do laundry. And you can borrow mine."" Sherlock keeps massaging.

""Fuck me..."" John groans, more swearing than actually asking to be fucked. No one had warned him that it would be this bad, but then again it wasn't as if cases like John's were normal.

Most Omegas who joined the military ended up bonded to someone in their unit. As a couple, they'd be given furlough every six months to copulate. The omega was expected to refrain from getting pregnant until they were no longer on active duty, but it gave their body a chance to regulate.

John had opted out of that option. Then there was the simple fact that no one, aside from his CO, knew he was an Omega. Being a doctor allowed him the privilege of showering in the hospital, and private quarters. Both of which helped him maintain his secret.

Sherlock takes off his shirt and hands it to John before continuing to massage. He works down John's leg, over his back, and back down the other leg. ""I'm sorry. I'm sure being close to an Alpha isn't making this better. Maybe I should leave you be.""

""I think it would be worse, knowing I'm alone."" John grunts, stuffing the soft shirt as close to his nose as he can without actually shoving it by his nose. ""You help... your scent helps. Please don't leave me alone."" From their vantage point, he can see the bag containing the toys, a low growl fills his chest. ""Not with them. I will not be reduced to fucking myself with a synthetic cock.""

""What if I fuck you with it?"" Sherlock asks, leaning in and scenting John by scrubbing his face along the back of John's neck.

""I don't want them. God, Sherlock."" John growls out, rubbing his neck against Sherlock's face. ""I want you, can't you see that? But it would be incredibly stupid because anything right now would result in me carrying your pups. And while I'm not against the idea, I need time to think, to process everything without having to pick out baby names.""

""When your heat is over we'll discuss it."" Sherlock nuzzles his scent gland. ""What can I do to help you now?""

""We'll discuss it? You're not saying no.."" John practically melts into the mattress with relief. He'd been so worried over losing the constant touches and kindness from the Alpha, that his body had reacted to the stress by intensifying his symptoms. As he relaxed, the cramps subsided and he let out a sigh. ""Just... keep rubbing me. Erm, my back, that is. Unless... no bad idea.""

""You're the best thing that ever happened to me, John. I can't say no to you. We'll talk when you're able to consent and have a coherent conversation."" Sherlock keeps rubbing. ""It's not a bad idea if it helps. Where do you want my hands?""

""Anywhere... everywhere. I want to feel you touch every inch of my body, and I want to touch yours."" John says, closing his eyes and humming at the feel of Sherlock's fingers pressing into tender muscles.

""You can touch me, John. Any way you'd like."" Sherlock works his hands over John's tight muscles, making sure to keep them from his crotch or arse.

At Sherlock's words, John lets out a low mewling noise. He surges forward, pulling himself up into his elbow quick as a flash, then acts before Sherlock has time to react. Using his legs for leverage he grips Sherlock's biceps and flips him onto his back, laying him flat against the mattress. John straddles Sherlock's hips and moans when his cock presses up against Sherlock's groin.

""Fuck..."" Leaning forward he places his forehead against Sherlock's chest and shudders.

It's hard to keep his hips still, but he manages and after a long moment he sits up, placing both his palms on Sherlock's chest he begins letting his fingers explore over pale skin.

Sherlock smiles up at him, a blush over his cheeks at being manhandled. ""You can grind against me if you need to. I won't stop you."" He rubs his hands over John's thighs.

""Mm probably a bad idea,"" John groans, ""not sure I can control myself if I start that. Let me just touch you for now. Put your hands on my back.""

Sherlock nods, pressing his big warm hands to John's back. ""Have you ever touched an Alpha like this John? Ever imagined an Alpha would submit to your needs?""

""I've never been touched by an Alpha at all,"" John admits, rolling his back against the broad hands splayed against his skin. He drags his fingers across the various scars on Sherlock's body.

""I never let myself show as an Omega. It was embarrassing for my family to have me go into heat. My heats have been suppressed since a young age, and I've done all I can to pass as a beta."" John scoffs, his face going sour. ""Can't get the wrong attention if you just hide your whole life.""

""You don't have to hide anymore, John. You don't have to hide from me. I'll keep you safe. I won't let anyone hurt you."" Sherlock promises, on hand coming up and rubbing against John's scent gland in his neck.

They may have started out faking their relationship but after a few weeks into the ruse, Sherlock had told Lestrade the truth. Not only did he tell him that it was fake but he also told Lestrade that he wishes it wasn't. How he was afraid to lose John by being too Sherlock or that John would leave him for someone else.

""I've never.. I've never wanted anyone as close to me as you are. People are so stupid and hateful, John. But you. You're brilliant. You're so strong and brave. You make me laugh until it hurts. I can't imagine working or living without you. You've become a center point of my life. I was adrift and I didn't even know it until you limped into my view and changed everything. I said it before, I'm at your mercy."" He rubs John's back and hips. He knew John's pheromones were affecting him. He couldn't feel it. But if anything they made it easier for him to say what he'd been holding back instead of making up, or suppressing feelings.

""I.. I want to kiss you. For real. Not just a quick peck for our land lady's sake"" John sighs, his hips rolling against Sherlock as if acting on their own free will.

""It stopped being fake for me weeks ago, John."" Sherlock blushes, angling his hips a bit so John can get better friction.

John surges forward at Sherlock's admission. With his chest flat against Sherlock's chest, he plants one hand beside Sherlock's face, the other hand cupping stubbly skin. He rubs their noses together, then presses his thin lips against Sherlock's full lips. He moans upon contact, hips sliding and his left hand playing with Sherlock's jawline. The moment is bliss, and John finds himself wanting to stay like that, never to move again.

Sherlock wraps his arms tight around John, holding him close as they kiss. He pulls back just enough to lick at John's neck. ""When this heat is over we'll talk. We'll figure out what we both want. What we need. For now, I'm going to kiss you as my life depends on it."" He mumbles, his voice rumbling deep in his chest before he kisses John again.

John gasps as Sherlock's tongue slides over his neck. It's the first time an Alpha has ever touched him there. He shivers and falls into Sherlock's words, wrapping the promise around him like a blanket.

""My life does depend on it,"" He says greedily, and while it isn't exactly true, it feels right. Every fiber of his body is screaming to be close to Sherlock, to touch and be touched.

Sherlock's tongue slides across his lips and he parts them, letting it dip inside him. Their first breach of two becoming one. Sherlock gently teases and explores John's mouth with his tongue, his fingers finding their way to John's hair and pulling just enough to make him groan. He holds John's hip in his other hand and rocks his hips up against John's. He can feel John's slick starting to dampen his pants.

""Sherlock..."" John gasps, rolling his lower half against the grip and the friction. ""I... I want to come, is that okay?""

His body desperately needs another orgasm, even if achieved without any form of internal stimulants. It feels good, amazing even, to have those long fingers digging into his hips, ghosting over skin, every now and then dipping below his waistband. He can feel Sherlock's length against him, hard and hot, the heady scent of Sherlock's matching desire filling his nose.

John breaks away from the kiss and gives into his most basic instinct. He rubs his neck and cheeks against Sherlock's body, his neck, his chest, his face. He wants Sherlock to smell like him, to claim him so the rest of the Omegas knew that this Alpha was courting someone else.

Sherlock groans, rubbing his face against John's neck. ""Will you come on me? Mark me? Claim me? Make sure all the other Omega's know I'm yours? I want that. Please, John.""

""Yeah... yeah."" John husks out, swallowing a lump of emotion as he reaches down and fumbles with his trousers. He manages to get them partially off, hanging on by one leg only. He doesn't care, it's enough to free his cock, and that's all that matters. He wants to see Sherlock's cock, compare them and rub their erections together, but just the simple act of touching himself is already sending him over the edge.

Reaching between his legs he gathers some of his slick on his fingertips and coats his cock with it. It takes less than a dozen strokes before he's shaking and crying Sherlock's name. Milky come oozes from his tip and drips onto Sherlock's taught stomach, the sight causing John to growl through his ecstasy. Once he's spent, he slides his fingers through the mess on Sherlock's stomach and hums appreciatively, smearing it into Sherlock's skin and enjoying the way their two scents combine.

Sherlock growls, not one of anger or aggression but of need and want. ""Mine. My Omega. I'll be your Alpha. I'll be so good to you. Whatever you need. Whatever you want. Yours. All yours."" He licks his lips as he watches John come.

Sherlock's words cloud John's judgment. He'd long scoffed at silly Omegas who bend over backward at being claimed. But now hearing those words, he finds he wants to hear them again and again.

Without thinking he moves until He's sitting on Sherlock's calves. He paws at the waistband of Sherlock's pyjamas and claws them down to his thighs. His cock is hard, and massive, the perfect specimen of Alpha. There's no swollen knot, telling John that above all odds Sherlock has retained some control over himself.

He leans forward and rubs his cheek against the firm velvety skin, then wraps his lips around its crown. He glances up, his intention clear. He wants to taste Sherlock, taste the Alpha who'd been kind when others would claim and take.

""You can do whatever you'd like. But I won't fuck you. Not yet. Not until we're both sane and clear-headed."" Sherlock groans, his cock hard and pulsing.

It takes a bit more effort than it had for himself, but before long he can smell the change in Sherlock. He was close, and John wanted every ounce of come inside him. And if the Alpha wouldn't fuck it into him, then he'd just have to swallow it. Wrapping one hand around the base, John moves his head faster, sucking harder and rolling his tongue. He can't fit Sherlock fully into his mouth, but he does his best.

""John... John... John!"" Sherlock babbles and chants, John's name, a plea, and a prayer on his lips. His cock throbs for John and soon it's all too much. John's smell, his warmth, his attention, his mouth. It's too much. Then Sherlock is coming, filling John's mouth with his hot potent come.

John's Omega side sings and preens as Sherlock's come bursts into his mouth and throat. He swallows, not wanting to waste a single drop. He sucks until Sherlock is thoroughly spent and is twitching below him. Only then does John let Sherlock's softening cock slide from his mouth. He climbs off of Sherlock's legs and curls up against Sherlock's side, closing his eyes and humming happily.

""Maybe... I'll let you use those toys on me, if I get to do that again."" He says smugly, enjoying the way his Alpha tastes in his mouth.

""Mm, I'll do anything you want. As soon as I can feel my body again."" Sherlock slurs a bit as he wraps his arm around John. He hadn't come in years and he certainly never came like that.

Tugging John impossibly close he nuzzles her hair and scents him, wanting John to be smothered in him. ""How are you feeling?""

""Mmm..."" John thinks, consulting his body with a sluggish inward gaze, ""better, I think. Orgasms help, you help. Was that.. okay? I should have asked.""

""If that's what orgasms are supposed to feel like, maybe I'll partake more."" Sherlock kisses John's head. ""It was phenomenal.""

""Mmm, they can be nice, if shared with the right person. Solo missions are a bit like finding cheese in the fridge and planning a meal around it, just to find out the cheese is mouldy.""

John nuzzles close and drags a blanket up over their exposed bodies.

""Going to have a nap, wake me if the flat catches on fire.""

""I'll just carry you out."" Sherlock rubs his fingers through John's hair.

John grins as he falls asleep, the thought of Sherlock carrying a naked Omega through flames somehow felt perfectly them.

Thanks for reading! Leave a comment and let us know what you think!

With John's pseudo heat behind them, they discuss bonding and what that means.

Hope you're enjoying this! We have a fun twist coming up soon! - Tindo

John sleeps for the better part of an hour, and when he wakes he finds the cramps have subsided and a dry uncomfortable feeling tells him he's stopped producing slick.

""Sherlock?"" he groans, lifting a head and finding the Alpha watching him. He can still taste Sherlock in his mouth, so he doesn't have to ask if the blow job was real. Instead, he just gives the Alpha a small smile, then nuzzles his face against his chest.

""Your heat seems to have broken."" Sherlock rubs Johns's back. ""You stopped smelling so strong about twenty minutes ago. How do you feel?""

""I've been better, but I've also been worse. My arms don't ache from fucking myself. Can't imagine that would have done my shoulder any favours."" John sighs and shifts under the blanket. He needs the bathroom, but at the same time, he doesn't want to leave Sherlock's side.

Sherlock nods. ""How about I order us some takeaway and we can share a shower while it's on the way?"" He offers, knowing John needs to eat and his alpha instincts wanting to provide for his omega.

""There's still half of yesterday's curry in the fridge... get something that pairs with it, like.. more curry."" John says with a grin, as the words ""we, share and shower"" sink in.

""Please tell me you enjoy hot showers that melt your skin off.""

""More curry."" Sherlock chuckles and gets his phone, sending a text for the order. ""I'll boil the water myself if you want."" He snorts.

Kicking off his pyjamas, which still clung to one leg, John gets up and stretches, unashamed of being naked in broad daylight.

He gets to the bathroom first, and steps into the shower, flicking the water on, he ramps up the hot water and stands under the spray while waiting for Sherlock.

Once the Alpha has joined him, he gives Sherlock a few moments under the water, then crowds him against the shower wall.

""I remember everything, every nice thing you did for me. Every promise, every touch."" He whispers, lips ghosting along with Sherlock's ear. ""You, Sherlock Holmes, are one very sexy Alpha.""

""Good because I meant every word."" Sherlock runs his hands over John's wet hot skin. He teases his fingertips over John's low back, nearly touching his arse.

""I want you to bond me... during my next heat. I want you, Sherlock."" John says, his eyes fluttering closed under Sherlock's touches.

""If you're willing, I'll skip my suppressants, let myself have a natural, unhindered heat, and we can bond... become one. And if you're willing, we'll have to have a serious talk about expectations, children, shared spaces... ownership.."" The last word slides off John's tongue like acrid grease, but there is little he can do about it.

Once bonded, legally his rights turnover and belong to his Alpha, it wasn't ideal, but he felt safe in Sherlock's hands.

""I would not be owning you, John. If anything you'd be owning me. You're the more stable, more human one."" Sherlock nuzzles him. ""I want to bond with you. Not bond you to me but us to each other. We'll still solve cases and eat takeaway. You'll still have rows with the chip n pin machine and I'll still make a mess of the flat. Nothing has to change so dramatically. We'll just be each other, formally and legally. I have no interest in owning you or being your warden. You're a grown man who can certainly take care of himself. The jury is still out on me on that account."" He chuckles softly.

""Yeah well, try telling the government that,"" John laughs, nuzzling along Sherlock's wet neck.

""Just sign the damned paper. It'll be like our secret, getting one up on the governing body of idiots.""

Sherlock hums softly, thinking. ""You may be on to something there, John..""

""Course I am."" John giggles then reaches behind Sherlock for the bottle of expensive body wash.

He squeezes a palm-full of the blue gel into his hand then replaces the bottle. Lathering it up between his hands he looks up at Sherlock and shrugs.

""Lots of mates do it... If they're true mates. The Alpha understands that it's a joint bonding, and just signs the bloody paperwork so the government leaves them alone. I think... I'd be able to call you my mate. It feels right, saying it even now.""

John places his palms on Sherlock's chest and begins working the rich lather over Sherlock's body. When he reaches the spot where his come had been, he smiles and skips over the area, wanting to preserve some of his scent on Sherlock's body.

""But the paperwork goes one way. The alpha assumes control of the omega. What if we did it both ways?"" Sherlock relaxes under John's touch.

""It doesn't exist."" John shrugged. ""Not that I haven't thought about that, but it would take reforming the whole system.""

John guides Sherlock to turn, so he can soap up his back, and arse, hands moving automatically with his familiarity with the human body.

""Sure, such a proposition would be met with praise and welcomed arms by so many. But the upper class, those with money and power, would squash any rays of hope before any new bill even had the chance to be voted on. People have tried, Alphas like you, who understand that I'm human, not a baby factory.""

John sighs and presses a kiss to the back of Sherlock's shoulder.

""But it never passes. The rich like owning things and that includes Omegas. What would they do if they couldn't own something they'd grown accustomed to having their whole life?""

""You're thinking too large scale. Just because the law doesn't have a statute for it doesn't mean we can't do it. We can draft our own contract within the bonding contract. There are always amendments in bonding paperwork, usually for the benefit of the alpha. We can make our own amendments and add whatever we like. It'll set a new president and they won't be able to change it because it is a contract between a private citizen and their intended mate."" Sherlock lets John do as he likes.

""Could work,"" John muses, dipping his hands low over Sherlock's body, fingers skimming his inner thighs.

""It would require a good lawyer from a firm that's been around ages. If the wrong Alpha is set to record our contract, and he reads the terms, he might push back.""

John's fingers dip between Sherlock's arse cheeks, then back down his thighs before John is turning them so his back is pressed against the wall and Sherlock standing under the water.

""I'd rather not involve my brother but he would have the connections."" Sherlock sighs. He reaches out for the shower gel and starts to rub sudsy hands over John. ""You mentioned children..""

""Yeah well... with me it's a biological possibility. Most suppressors have a contraceptive in them, but there are some that don't.""

John closes his eyes and sighs as Sherlock's hands roam over him.

""I've never really given it much thought, figured I'd never meet an Alpha worth two shits, so it didn't pertain to me.""

Sherlock washes and massages John's shoulders as he listens to him. ""What about now? Are pups something that you'd want?""

""Erm,"" John stops and thinks. Imagining what life would be like with the sounds of shrieking children running about. ""It isn't a terrible thought, as long as they're half yours. But I'm not exactly jumping up and down at the thought of rushing into it.""

He cracks a grin, remembering Sherlock's complaint the previous night.

""You could train them to solve crimes, send them off as interns to teach those coppers from that show how to solve a murder. They'd be smart, just like you, of that I'm sure.""

""They'd be able to take over the Yard before they were out of nappies."" Sherlock smirks. ""And I'm not the only smart one, John. You're a doctor, a brilliant surgeon. A lifesaver. I may be smart but they'd have your kindness and compassion as well. Maybe just a bit of your temper."" He chuckles.

He works his hands down John's body, washing away the dried slick.

""But you're right. I'm certainly in no rush. It'll probably take me quite some time to figure out how to be in a relationship let alone take care of a pup."" He says softly.

""It's... interesting,"" John sighs, enjoying Sherlock's fingers gliding over his arse and thighs. He arches into the touch and continues, his voice a bit more husky, ""Imagining what a human would be like having both of our traits. One minute they'd be pouting and throwing a Sherlock-sized temper tantrum, the next they'd be stomping their foot demanding an ice lolly at the top of their lungs.""

He smiles a little, realizing he wasn't totally against the idea of children. He still had a few more childbearing years left in him, and he felt a small clench in the pit of his stomach.

""I'm going to need time to adjust to this as well. Years of fighting off my body's need for an Alpha is going to make this tough. I might snap at you, and push you away once in a while. If I do, I'm sorry...""

""I've never been in any kind of relationship before so I'm sure I will screw up plenty."" Sherlock hums as he finishes washing John, watches the suds slowly slide down John's skin. ""If you don't ever want pups that's fine. If you do we'll talk about it when the time comes.""

John smiles and nods then reaches for Sherlock's shampoo. Afraid of getting it in Sherlock's eyes, he washes his own hair and passes the bottle over.

""Maybe someday."" He agrees, amazed at how easy it had been to reach an agreement on a topic that caused so many fights. ""I'll make sure to get a contraceptive today and start taking it right away. That way there are no accidents with my next heat.""

Leaning his head under the spray of water he washes the shampoo from his hair then says, ""What about normal heats... they're roughly every three months, though my body might be a bit out of sync. Do you want me to have them, or should I take suppressants again after we bond?""

""That is completely up to you. It is your body and your heats. I don't have any right to tell you how you should manage them."" Sherlock tips his head under the spray, washing the shampoo out. ""I will say that I think after being on suppressants for so long and your body's reaction to this heat that maybe you should try going suppressant-free and see how that works for you. If it's too much you can go back on suppressants. Whatever you choose I'll support you.""

""Could be inconvenient... if we're on a case."" John sighs, ""I can't control when they happen, just if they happen.""

He thinks about it and nods, letting Sherlock have his turn with the water.

""But you're right. I should let my body normalize a bit. Those military-grade suppressors are something else. Work like a charm, but they clearly fucked with me. I wasn't even supposed to have a heat, it was just supposed to be a period of discomfort that I was supposed to wait out, then swap brands.""

""Cases hold. And if it won't then someone else can solve it unless it's dire. We'll just keep an eye out and see if your heats fall into a cycle. Either way, we can work it out. I can review evidence while you're sleeping between rounds."" Sherlock shrugs as he rinses.

""You make it sound so... simple."" John glances over at Sherlock before stepping out of the shower. ""Thank you.""

""I don't like struggling. Every situation has an answer and can be resolved. If you're going to be my omega that makes you more important than the Work."" Sherlock says and then blinks, never having thought anything would be more important than the work let alone an omega.

""That sounds... strange."" John laughs, grabbing a second towel he passes it to Sherlock. ""But I can see by your stunned expression that it's genuine.""

Wrapping the towel around his hips, he grabs his toothbrush and begins washing the fuzzy feeling off his teeth. He'll need to go upstairs and change, but for now, he's happy staying in the humid warmth of the bathroom while they wait for food to arrive.

Sherlock nods as he dries himself. ""I've never thought of anything besides the work. I mean drugs for a bit there but that was just between cases to fill the void. I'm not sure what this means exactly.""

""Neither am I, if that makes you feel any better,"" John says around a mouthful of toothpaste. He spits into the sink then pops the toothbrush back into his mouth.

""My whole life I've been running from Alphas. Avoiding communal showers, or contact sports... God, I missed rugby. We got a good team going back in Afghanistan. With those blockers I could play again, that was heaven.""

Spitting again, he rinses off his toothbrush and leans against the sink.

""I avoided any scenario that would out me as being anything other than a Beta. Even though it was hard explaining how a bonded Alpha and Omega produced a beta, it was easier than saying what I truly was. I would have been sold off, Sherlock... become the property of one of London's elitists. Men like your brother...""

Sherlock growls at the mention of his brother, like a spectator over their happiness. ""Sorry. He just pisses me off. We've been having this fight since I woke up in the hospital after getting the shit beat out of me in school""

""Siblings, huh?"" John says, rolling his eyes. ""You should meet Harry. She claims I drove her to drink by my refusal to accept who I was.""

Pushing himself up off the sink John runs his hand over Sherlock's jaw. ""I like the stubble... it's rugged.""

With that, he lets his hand drop and heads upstairs for clothes. Catching sight of the mess in the sitting room he smiles. The effort Sherlock had gone to in order to make him comfortable made his heart flutter and butterflies take root in his stomach.

Sherlock looks at himself in the mirror as he brushes his teeth. He decides not to shave and keeps the stubble, he would deny it had anything to do with John. He got dressed and was just about done fixing his hair when the food delivery arrived downstairs. He headed down and got the food when he heard the knock.

Dressed in comfortable trousers, and a cotton t-shirt, John joins Sherlock in the kitchen.

He smiles at the dark stubble on Sherlock's chin but doesn't say anything.

While Sherlock lays the new food out, he goes to the fridge and re-heats the curry from earlier.

""So... I um, gave you a blowjob."" John says the moment Sherlock places a fork full of food in his mouth. ""Good?"" He asks, letting Sherlock decide if he meant the blowjob or the food.

""John, I couldn't feel my legs for a good five minutes. I think that means it was very good."" Sherlock blushes a bit. ""No one has ever done that for me before.""

John grins, then tucks into his meal. ""Good.""

While he eats, he finds himself thankful for the way things had turned out. If Sherlock had taken offense to his biology, things would have been incredibly different right now. He might not even have a home anymore.

When half his meal is gone, he looks up and catches Sherlock's eye.

""Can I call you 'my Alpha' even before we bond? Or... would you like time to get used to this?""

""In my head, I'm already referring to you as my omega, an unconscious switch on my part, so whatever you'd like."" Sherlock nods as he rips a section of naan and uses it to scoop some food. ""My brother is going to be insufferable about this."" He rolls his eyes.

""Let's not tell him until we need him to babysit,"" John says, his lips quirking up into a smirk.

""Knowing his goons he'd probably know you were carrying a pup before you did."" Sherlock snorts. ""And besides if we ever need a babysitter he is the last on the list behind Molly and Mrs. Hudson and my homeless network.""

""Mm you'd know before I knew."" John countered, still smiling at the thought of dropping a screaming child into the lap of Mycroft Holmes. It would be an added bonus if said child came with a full nappy.

""My scent would change almost instantly. Might take you a week or two to notice, but you'll know long before I can sense the change.""

Finishing his food, John scoops a bit more curry onto his plate and swipes some Naan through the sauce.

""So, what do we do in the meantime, while we wait for my next heat? Go back to normal? I go back to my room, you to yours? We... what? Kiss occasionally?""

""First we register together and get that out of the way so neither you nor I get in trouble. Then we make our own bond contact."" Sherlock finishes his last bite. ""I would like kisses to be a bit more often than occasional."" He can't help the blush creeping over his high cheekbones.

""Me too... and I'd like to not always sleep alone,"" John adds, feeling his face mirroring Sherlock's blush.

""I enjoyed sleeping beside you.""

""As do I."" Sherlock smiles. ""You also haven't had any nightmares while we've been sharing sleeping arrangements.""

John pauses, his mouth hanging open. It was true, normally his heats came with terrible nightmares. Before ware they were scenarios of less than favourable situations where he'd been caught out on the cusp of his heat, unable to seek shelter as bodies closed in around him.

After war, they'd morphed into strange scenarios where his former friends would rise from the dead and blame him for being an Omega for the reason they weren't still alive.

""Not one,"" he breathed.

""That's a good thing. Right?"" Sherlock asks softly, looking a bit unsure.

""Amazing."" John nods.

They share a small smile, then John stretches his foot out under the table, making contact with Sherlock's. And it was enough.

Both their bodies leaned into the touch. Sherlock's other foot stretched out and met his. They sat like that for a while, talking softly about their hopes for the future, and of past cases.

When the food was gone, John tried not to make a big deal over Sherlock offering to help clean up. Instead, he just passed Sherlock the tea towel and let him dry the dishes.

When the kitchen was cleaned up, they tackled the living room together, replacing Sherlock's mattress to its proper place, replacing the furniture, and mostly shutting the windows.

A passerby below sniffed hard, and glanced up as John leaned out to grab the window, he smirked up at him, a knowing look on his face.

John found he didn't hate being looked at like an Omega. It was fine, as long as he was Sherlock's omega.

Sherlock goes to John and looks out the window. He snarls when he sees the man down on the sidewalk. ""Keep moving or I'll cut you from cock to chin!"" He snaps.

John barks out a laugh and pulls Sherlock back into the flat.

""Alright, Alpha, calm your tits.""

Leaning up on tiptoes he pressed a kiss to Sherlock's cheek.

Sherlock leans in and nuzzles John, resting his hands on his hips. ""Sorry. That may have been a bit overboard.""

""Perhaps, a bit."" John agrees though he's smiling. ""I don't mind, but let's not go alienating our neighbors.

""There you go being socially conscious again."" Sherlock teases and smiles.

""One of us has to be.""

Giggling he wraps his arms around Sherlock's middle and pulls him tight against his chest.

""Now what? We just waltz into the nearest registration office and demand a blank contract form?""

""We could and time how long it takes my brother to arrive."" Sherlock snorts.

""Let's do that tomorrow. I have a better idea. You said you'd touch me after my heat is over. Well, it's over.""

John raises an eyebrow at Sherlock and nods towards his bedroom.

""There's a lovely, freshly made bed that I would love to mess up.""

Sherlock blushes and nods. ""Perhaps it's too fresh and clean.""

""Oh?"" John stops. Planting both hands on his hips he quirks his head up at Sherlock. ""Is that your way of saying that one orgasm is good enough this year?""

""No, I just-"" Sherlock starts.

""SHERLOCK HOLMES! You get down here this instant!"" Mr. Hudson calls from downstairs.

John and Sherlock share a look, and then John shrugs.

""After you, she sounds mad. I'll let my big scary Alpha go first.""

Sherlock bites his lip and goes down the stairs.

""Why are there purple stains on my carpet?"" Mrs. Hudson points down to the carpet where bright purple stains had marred her carpet.

""Well you see I needed some dye for an experiment and I didn't know that the bottle had a hole."" Sherlock looks apologetic. ""I did try to scrub them out.""

John stands back and crosses his arms over his chest. He does his absolute best not to smile, or show that he's getting any enjoyment out of Sherlock being cowed by a small elderly Beta woman, but truthfully, he was thoroughly enjoying it.

""Do I even want to know why you needed purple dye, or *when* you needed it... you've erm.. been quite busy the last few days.""

""The organs you got me."" Sherlock blushes.

""You are going to scrub my carpet and get these drips out. You're a chemist, you should be able to figure out how to get dye out of fibers."" Mrs. Hudson tsks. ""Tea, John?"" He leads John to the kitchen.

""Feeling better?"" The landlady asks, pushing John into a chair while she fills the kettle.

""Better.. yeah."" John stammers, remembering the taste of Sherlock's cock in his mouth. ""Just a short bug. Must have picked it up from the clinic.""

Sherlock goes about cleaning the carpet.

""Poor thing. Sherlock was so nervous."" Mrs. Hudson pours them both a cup of tea.

""Mmm, came on fast. New tea?"" John asks, attempting to steer the conversation away from his supposed illness.

Mrs. Hudson nods and launches into a whole story about how her usual tea wasn't available at her tea shop and the girl at the counter recommended this one. ""But I'm not sure I like this one."" She looks at her cup.

""I like it,"" John says, smiling kindly at the woman. He looks around her kitchen and spots an old photo of her, a few years younger posing beside a tall man with curly dark hair. Though his skin has some color, and his chin a little less refined, he recognizes Sherlock instantly. A thought comes to him, and he bites his lip.

""While his nibs is busy..."" John whispers, ""You've known Sherlock for a long time... Was it a surprise to you, to learn he and I were a couple? Has he had relationships in the past? He says he hasn't, and I'm inclined to believe him.. but.. You know, curious minds, and all that.""

""I've known Sherlock for a long time. He helps me with some sticky business with my late husband."" Mrs. Hudson sips her tea. ""I was surprised when he said he had someone. He kept the details vague, at first, I thought he was shaming. But then you showed up with him and I've never seen a better match."" She smiles. ""He's never brought anyone home or anything like that. Before he got clean.."" She thinks how to say it delicately.

Sherlock comes into the kitchen and gets swim cleaners from under the sink before going back to the other room.

""Before he got clean his brother cut him off from all the family money. I let him crash at a flat I owned on Montague Street so he'd have somewhere warm and safe to stay. Some people would come and go but they wouldn't stay very long. I realized that they were drug dealers."" Mrs. Hudson makes a face.

She gets up and gets some biscuits from the cupboard before sitting back down.

""I told him that if he didn't clean up his act that I wouldn't speak to him again. He told me he didn't care and said all sorts of rude things, which I don't hold against him. I know what drugs do to a person."" She nods, dunking her biscuit into her tea. ""He disappeared for about a week before coming back and begging for forgiveness.""

""Addiction is hard. But I'm glad he had you, Mrs. H.""

John sits and mulls over the information. He didn't know much about Sherlock's past, aside from that there had been an addiction problem. Then there was whatever was going on between Sherlock and his brother. Part of John just imagined that it was sibling rivalry, as only the Holmes knew how to display.

""I should go make sure he hasn't passed out from fumes. Thanks for the tea.""

Finishing the last dregs of his tea John stands and pats the landlady's shoulder. Going out into the other room he leans on the doorframe and watches Sherlock with a small smirk.

""Need any help, or can I just sit here and admire the view. And by view, I mean your arse.""

Sherlock blushes as he scrubs, from John's words rather than the exertion from scrubbing. ""It's starting to come up but I don't think they come out completely.""

""Mm, keep wiggling back and forth like that and something else is going to ... Oh, hello, Mrs. H. Sherlock's got the worst of it up,"" John says sweetly, hearing the landlady behind him.

She titters about, suggesting a few different cleaning chemicals before leaving the two men alone again.

""Do you get your trousers tailored to your arse just to impress me, or do you just like the way it feels, having them fit you like a second skin.""

John feels the growl bubble in his chest and covers it by clearing his throat.

""Sorry, I think I might still be a bit... ill""

Sherlock chuckles softly. ""I may wear tighter trousers around you than not."" He smirks a bit. ""Oh."" He looks surprised and looks up at John. ""Would you like to top?""

""Top... top what?"" John says, looking around confused.

""Me."" Sherlock stands. ""Would you like to fuck me, John?""

""Oh... top, as in.. in the bedroom.""

John rolls his head back, leaning it against the wooden frame of the door, and shrugs.

""That's all I know, aside from toys, I haven't had anyone inside me. Ever. Beta's don't care who's doing the work, as long as everyone has an orgasm. I've had sex, but only with Beta's, and mostly women. I guess.. what I'm trying to say in a very roundabout way, Sherlock."" John sighs and lifts his head up, locking his gaze with Sherlock's. ""I want to try it all. With you.""

Sherlock takes three strides to John and cups his cheek in one hand before leaning in and kissing him.

""Mmm."" John hums, dropping his hand onto Sherlock's hip, though he wrinkles his nose at the stink of chemicals on Sherlock's hands. ""Finish up here, and meet me upstairs.""

Pulling away from Sherlock he slides his hands over Sherlock's arse then heads up the stairs. He goes up the second flight of stairs to his room. He takes his favourite pillow and heads back to Sherlock's room.

Sherlock scrubs for a while longer until all the spots were just a light hue of purple.

John's heat isn't ready to give up the ghost yet. Sherlock helps him through one last aftershock.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


When Sherlock joins John in his bedroom, John has his pillow stuffed under his head and a nest of blankets wrapped around him. He smiles lazily up from his nest and pats the bed beside him.



""Joining me?""



Sherlock smiles softly and climbs into the nest. ""How are you feeling?"" He nuzzles John, holding him close.



""Tired, mostly, still a little... erm, horny for lack of a better word."" John leans into Sherlock's nuzzling, tilting his head back, giving the alpha access to his neck so he can be scented.



""I love smelling like you,"" he admits, rubbing the side of his face against the stubble on Sherlock's chin.



Sherlock scents John, kissing his neck gently. ""I like it as well. It's.. satisfying when you smell like me.""



He gently rubs his stubble against John's jaw, rubbing against his omega. ""Can I help with the horny feeling?""



""Mm, perhaps."" John grins, rocking his hips against Sherlock's body. ""What are you open to? Do you want to just... this,"" he asks, rutting his erection against Sherlock's. ""Or... I'd let you have me.""



Sherlock thinks as he kisses John's neck. ""I want to suck your cock and eat your arse."" He mumbles as he licks John's scent gland.



""God, yes... please."" John moans, rolling his head into his pillow, letting Sherlock's nose slide further back along his jawline. ""would you?""



""Yes."" Sherlock teasingly drags his teeth over John's neck before kissing down his body.



John kicks his pants off and pulls away from Sherlock long enough to tear his shirt off. ""Clothes... off,"" he mutters, pawing at Sherlock's shirt.



Sherlock chuckles and strips, naked over his omega.



""Sherlock.."" John sigh, their bare chests touching, ""I want you inside me, any part of you, please. Tongue, finger, cock. Show me what it feels like, please?""



""I'll fuck you later when your heat is gone for sure."" Sherlock kisses him deeply before moving down between John's legs.



John hooks his legs up over Sherlock's shoulders and settles back against the bed. Sherlock nudges his nose against his groin, his cheek sliding against his cock.



""Sherlock, more... please?""



John's voice is a low whisper as if he's scared that a full volume might scare Sherlock off.



Sherlock takes his time, kissing John's cock from base to tip, and watches John for his reactions.



John slams his head back against the pillow and arches his back. Sherlock's mouth is like wildfire, spreading across his cock, his tongue like hot flames, licking their way across his skin. He imagines that every touch leaves a visual mark, a brand showing that Sherlock is claiming his body as his own.



Afraid that, should anyone get too close and see the biological difference, John had (until now) avoided receiving blowjobs. It was one thing to fuck in dim lighting, another to allow someone's head to be inches away from the secret he'd been avoiding since his early teens.



John grips the sheets tight as Sherlock's lips suck in his crown, his tongue sliding along his skin like butter on warm bread.



""Sher..."" he gasps, rocking forward and trying to sink his cock deeper into the wet heat. But Sherlock moves with him, chuckling as he maintains the barely-there contact.



""Fuu.."" John tries to swear, but the word is lost in his throat when a slender finger glides over his entrance.



So close to his heat, the area is still loose and willing to accept the intrusion. Sherlock's finger slides inside, and John feels a wet rush of slick glide out of him.



""Ahhh."" he cries, tense muscles falling limp against the bed as Sherlock slips into the last knuckle, the back of his hand falling flush with his body. ""No. one... ever.. just you."" He tries to say, but Sherlock's tongue is circling the head of his cock, making John forget words, and how to breathe.



Sherlock rocks his finger slowly, cataloging everyone of John's reactions to each different movement. There was so much slick and he smelled so good it made Sherlock's head swim.




Focus, focus.




Sherlock looks up at John, his pupils blown dark as he slowly bobs his head to take John deeper into his mouth. Omega males usually had small cocks since they weren't exactly needed but Sherlock was still quite impressed with the side of John's. He loved the feeling of that hard velvet skin sliding into his mouth, the throbbing of John's cock over his tongue.



Sherlock pulls back just enough to kiss and suck on the tip as he slides a second finger into John's desperate leaking hole.



""For the love of God,"" John croaks, his hips rocking and bucking as if being controlled by someone else.



""If you don't fuck me while I'm still partially open, I swear to god I'm going to fall apart at the seams.""



Sherlock's fingers sink in deeper, the tips brushing over his prostate and he cries out in a broken sob.



""I swear, I can consent, I need this. I need to know what it's like to have an Alpha inside me. To have you inside me.""



Lifting his head from the pillow John looks down at Sherlock with pleading eyes.



""Please, Sherlock? Please, give this to me?""



Sherlock slowly pulls off John's cock, trying to think. He knew John was in the last grips of his heat. He knew there was still a possibility of getting John pregnant.



A strangled cry rips from John's throat at the loss of Sherlock's mouth on his cock.



He pushes himself up into a sitting position, dropping his legs from Sherlock's shoulders he gets on his knees and does the one thing he never thought he'd do.



He grabs Sherlock's face in both of his hands and begs.



""Please, Sherlock? I'll be a good Omega for you. It'll feel good, for both of us, I promise. Please?""



""I know, John. I know. Soon. I promise. I'll get the toys. I'll fuck you with the toys.."" Sherlock kisses John.



John growls in frustration and collapses back against the bed.



He watches, half angry, half turned on, as Sherlock slips from the bed and leaves the room without putting a stitch of clothing on.



When Sherlock returns, bag of toys in hand, John looks up from where he's curled up on his side and asks in a quiet voice, ""Why? Am I not good enough?""



""You're too good for me, John. That's why I won't risk screwing things up."" Sherlock says softly sitting on the bed and pulling toys out of the bag.



""Screwing what up?"" John's forehead wrinkles as he tries to catch up. ""What are you on about? How hard is it to shove a dick inside a wet hole?""



He eyes the toy Sherlock has selected and sighs. It's long and slim but has an inflatable alpha's knot around the base. He knows the type, having used them in the past.



It will do, but this time, he wanted the real thing, to feel Sherlock's warmth inside him would certainly be nothing like a cold and lifeless toy.



""I can still smell a bit of heat on you. Which means neither of us is thinking exactly clearly. It also means I could still get you pregnant.""



Pregnant The word crashes around John like a ton of bricks.



""Oh... shit... You're right, I wasn't thinking clearly. That hadn't even crossed my mind.""



John uncurls himself and sits up, wincing as his movement dragged slick across Sherlock's clean sheets.



""Thank you, Sherlock, for thinking of me.""



Shuffling on his knees he goes back to kneeling in front of Sherlock, this time resting his head on Sherlock's shoulder.



Looking up, he nudges his nose along Sherlock's jaw. ""Kiss me?""



Sherlock holds John close and kisses him gently. ""I would love to be inside you. Feeling your tight wet heat wrapped around my cock. But not yet. Soon."" He nuzzles him.



""Yeah, alright. I can wait."" John sighs, rubbing their noses together, then their cheeks.



He pulls away and lays back down, knees spread apart. But before Sherlock has time to move an idea comes to him.



""I can still have you inside me, just not... that way. Get over here,"" he pushes the pillows to the floor and wiggles a bit lower on the bed, ""Give me your cock while you fuck me. I can suck you off at the same time.""



Sherlock lets John situate him. ""I can suck you and fuck you with the toys as well."" He smirks.



""Oh, can you now?"" John grins, despite Sherlock not being able to see his face, and slides his hands from Sherlock's arse up his back as far as he can reach.



""Multi-task for me, pretty boy,"" he whispers, dragging his teeth across Sherlock's pale arse before dipping his head lower and sucking Sherlock's cock into his mouth.



At the same time, Sherlock's fingers re-enter him, drawing a half moan, half sigh from John's lips.



Wiggling his hips a bit, he angles his arse up and is rewarded by a spark of pleasure as Sherlock finds his prostate again.



Sherlock takes John's cock back into his mouth, sucking in time with his rocking fingers. Once he finds John's prostate he rubs it gently, continuing the motions that make John keen and tremble.



He picks up the dildo and warms it against his body first before rubbing the fat head against John's slick hole teasingly.



John's mouth is too full for him to properly complain. Instead, he growls and thrusts his hips up off the bed. The head slides across his hole then skitters over it.



Frustrated, he scrapes just the smallest amount of teeth down Sherlock's cock, and thrusts up into the wet heat of Sherlock's mouth. More, now please. He screams internally, his whole body vibrating with desire.



Sherlock chuckles around John's cock and starts to slide the dildo into his lover.



While not the real thing, it had been years since John had felt anything inside him. His whole body melts as the pleasure washed over him.



His movements become uncoordinated, his head coming to an almost complete standstill with Sherlock's cock still inside his mouth.



After several long seconds, when it becomes apparent that John either can't or won't move, Sherlock's hips begin to move.



With slow, but deep thrusts, Sherlock pushes himself, and the toy, inside John at the same time.



John feels full. Fuller than he's ever been before. That feeling, mixed with the still somehow coordinated movements of Sherlock's mouth, promising to bring him to a quick release.



Sherlock barely has the toy worked up to the knot when John begins to whimper, a poor communication to relay he was about to come, but the only thing he could think of.



Sherlock swallows around John's cock and presses the dildo deeper, pumping the knot steadily until it was stuck inside John. What John didn't know is that this model had a special attachment that also released fake cum.



Warmth floods John's insides as his climax takes over. His body twitches and shakes, but Sherlock's body weight holds him in place.



Something foreign and slick pulses inside his hole and with a muffled cry John comes hard against the back of Sherlock's throat.



He can feel Sherlock's knot, for the first time, begin to swell against his lips. John reaches up with one hand and wraps his fingers along the swollen knot, stroking it with his fingers as he rides out the last waves of his orgasm.



There's a growl from between his legs, and suddenly Sherlock's cock slips out of his mouth and lands on his chest with a wet squelch. Warm come oozes over John's chest and stomach, as the smell of Alpha finds a permanent place in his memories.



When he's done, he's thoroughly spent, and it's all he can do to wipe the back of his hand over his mouth, cleaning up saliva and pre-come from his chin.



Sherlock pants and takes a step back to catch his breath. He gently moves John into a more comfortable position on the bed, being careful of the dildo still locked in place. ""Alright?"" He nuzzles John, scenting him.



""Mmm,"" John manages, closing his eyes and letting Sherlock rub against the sides of his neck. His head rolls from side to side with the movements, but he's smiling lazily.



He clenches around the toy, imagining it was Sherlock rather than a dildo and nuzzles his nose against the side of Sherlock's head.



""You?""



""Quite alright."" Sherlock nods, sliding his fingers through his cum on John's chest. His inner alpha all but purring at the satisfaction of having his cum cover his mate.



""Mm, good,"" John says, closing his eyes and sighing.



""Don't want to wash it off..."" he sighs as Sherlock's finger traced circles in his come-covered skin. ""But I'm going to make a mess if I rollover. And.."" he wiggles his arse a bit, wincing as the toy shifts inside him and something slick shifts inside.



""Something tells me they'll be an even bigger mess when you pull that out.""



""My research indicated that the feeling of being filled with cum, even fake cum, helped with cramping as well as sexual craving. So I found a model that would help with that."" Sherlock hums. ""We could take you to the bath, that way any leaking would go down the drain when the dildo is released.""



""You just want to video me waddling to the bathroom with a cock up my arse."" John grins, cracking an eye open and drinking in the sight of Sherlock smiling down at him.



""Don't deny it. I know you want to.""



Sherlock chuckles and kisses John. ""It'll just give me more ideas for later if you have to waddle around with my cock inside you."" He smirks.



He gently bushes John's hair back. ""I'll carry you of course. Just don't make a habit of it. Can't let you get too domesticated of me. We still need that soldier edge for cases.""



John rolls his eyes, a gesture that is lost on Sherlock, who's already through the en-suit door to the bathroom. The sound of rushing water fills the room, and the scent of bath salts makes John shudder.



John tries to brush off Sherlock's offer, but strong arms scoop him up and carry him into the bathroom. He's gently placed in the tub. Warm water smelling of lavender and vanilla laps around his body.



Sherlock reaches an arm between John's legs and waits for John to nod. The knot is deflated, and the toy gently eased out of him.



John instantly misses the fullness. He whimpers slightly, but Sherlock is there, slipping into the water behind him.



His softening cock presses against the small of John's back as they lay there together in the warm.



When the tub threatens to overflow, John reaches up and turns the taps off with his feet.



""This is nice."" He sighs, nuzzling the back of his head against Sherlock's neck.



""I will admit I thought of joining you the other day in the bath,"" Sherlock says softly as he wraps his arms around John's midsection.



John laughs and shakes his head. ""I wanted to play with your hair... you sitting with your back against the tub. Those curls just... there.""



He places his hands over Sherlock's and relaxes into the embrace.



""I didn't want to like you. You were so arrogant, still can be. I felt like a science experiment, between having to pretend we were in a relationship down to the way you seem to look into my soul when you look at me.""



John's thumbs trace over the back of Sherlock's hands, the movement sluggish in the water.



""I thought any minute now, he's going to discover my secret. He's either going to pin me against a wall and bite me, or kick me out.""



""Instead, you surprised me, you showed your true colours. Showed me the kind man you try so hard to hide.""



Sherlock is quiet for a while. ""It's better if I'm brash and bold. It keeps people off-kilter. That way it's easier to see what's hidden when they're thrown and defensive. Why do you think Donovan always tugs her skirt down to cover her knees when she sees upcoming? Covering up is always more obvious than not."" He snorts.



He nuzzles John's hair, breathing in his scent. ""I.. I probably should have figured honestly but I was too caught up in being amazed that you actually decided to stay. I gave it three days, a week tops. But you stayed. You yelled back at me when I shouted at you. You made endless cups of tea. And helped me solve cases, catch bad guys. Saved my life."" He says softly, nosing behind John's ear.



""Course I stayed,"" John said as if that was answer enough.



""You gave me back a life full of adventure. After the army didn't want me anymore, I thought I was destined to have a life full of a forced bond, and a forced family.""



John subconsciously runs a hand over his stomach and shudders. ""Sherlock, how could I love my own children if they were forced on me. If I had no choice in having them? When I knew, if they presented as Omega's they'd be sold off after their first heat?""



He shakes his head firmly then sighs. ""You saved my life... There's a reason I held on to my service gun.""



Sherlock's arms tighten around John at the admission. ""You are your own person. You make your own choices. I'm just here to support you. Just like any couple."" He says softly.



""If we ever do have pups I won't allow them to be sold off. They'll stay with us until they go to university or whatever they choose. They'll be taught exactly the same. No difference between alpha or omega or beta. They'll each be given the same opportunities and support. We'll make sure they can defend themself no matter their secondary sex. I will not have our pups sold off like cattle.""



""I'd like that..."" John says then blinks, realizing how true his words were.



""Not now, but maybe in the future? Minds to teach, nurture, love? Almost sounds like a happy life.""



The water starts to get cold, but instead of getting out John leans forward and pulls the plug, letting some of the water drains out. Once half of it is gone, he puts the plug back in and turns the water back on.



Sherlock reaches for a bathbomb, and they watch as it fizzes and turns the tub a foamy blue.



""Did you ever think you could have that? A happy life?""



""Never,"" Sherlock says without hesitation. ""And then came you..""


John REALLY likes baths.

Mycroft steps in to make sure the legal side is taken care of...


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


It takes two more days for John to finally feel normal again. He wakes that morning to find Sherlock already dressed and pacing the lounge, his mobile pressed to his ear. 
Wrapping his dressing gown around him. John perks up his ears and listens to Sherlock's side of the conversation while turning the kettle on.



""No, Mycroft,"" and low growls are all John manages to hear. The conversation lasts until the kettle starts to boil, then Sherlock hangs up and lets out a frustrated growl. 



""Let me guess... he's sending a car to take us to the registry?"" John says while pulling two mugs out of the cabinet.



""Yes,"" Sherlock grumbles. ""And he wants us to go out to my parent's house for a bond contract signing party this weekend."" He presses against John's back in a strop, his lanky form heavy despite all his looks for malnourishment.



""Well, isn't that... nice?"" John says, then shakes his head. ""Nope, that doesn't sound right. That's not nice, that's torture. He's torturing us. Call him up and tell him to ship me back to Afghanistan. At least there the torture is expected."" John chuckles, and when Sherlock's chest vibrates against his and a low rumbling laugh fills his ears (then his groin) he nearly drops the tea kettle. The sound sends desire coursing through him like wildfire. 



""Well, we can make the car waiting, and we can file for an extension if we need to. That should give us time to draft our own contract. Plus, there won't be a bond until my next heat. Which could be months away."" John pushes down the pang of want with a regretful sigh.



""He's told Mummy."" Sherlock pouts. ""His mouth is as big as the rest of him. He only tells her things about my life so he doesn't have to tell her things about his. But he doesn't have a life. Just 'a small position in the government'."" He makes a gagging sound.



""I much prefer it when you gag on my cock."" John deadpans, making his mate hum in satisfaction. Shifting below Sherlock's weight to reach for the teabags before continuing, ""Then we go to your parents, and have the loudest sex we can imagine. Or just play a porno on full volume so they think it's us.""



""Why can't Mycroft just knock up some poor underling so mummy leaves me alone."" Sherlock gives a great big sigh.



John ignores Sherlock's strop. Instead, he turns around, nearly knocking over the steeping tea with his elbows and grins mischievously.



""Can I be a bossy arsehole to you in front of your parents? We can make them wonder if you've gone mad and have decided to attempt to bond with another Alpha.""



""Oh 

John

 you are a wonder."" Sherlock grins and kisses John deeply, pressing him back against the counter.



""That wasn't a no,"" John says in between kisses. ""You realize if you don't say no, I'm going to strut in there like I own the place.""

""Do it. My father will think it's hysterical."" Sherlock says with a laugh.



Placing his hands on Sherlock's hips he grins and leans up into the attention. For once, able to enjoy kissing without the pang of need pulling him down tho his most basic form.



""I don't care if the car is here now, I'm eating breakfast, and having a shower,"" John announces after a moment. Breaking from the seemingly endless waves of kisses he turns to place sugar in Sherlock's tea, and just milk in his.



""What breakfast food takes the longest to make?""



""A proper fry up. Eggs, bacon, sausage. The works."" Sherlock smirks, pulling the frying pan out and placing it on the cooktop. 



John manages to milk his time, making Mycroft's car wait nearly two full hours. When the clock announces it's just ten in the morning, he sighs and reaches for his coat.



""Shall we go sign my life away, figuratively speaking?""



""Mm, I suppose so. You could walk me around on a collar."" Sherlock wiggles his brows suggestively.



""As tempting as that is, let's not push our luck. Trying to draft our own contract is going to be uncommon enough as it is. I won't be surprised if they try and fight us on it. If we go in disrespectfully they'll deny any requests.""  John stops halfway down the stairs and smirks, ""But we can save the collar for your parents.""



Sherlock snorts. ""I suppose I'll keep you around."" He teases as he follows John downstairs. Climbing into the back of the car he started and rolled his eyes. Not expecting to see his brother waiting for them in the backseat. ""Mycroft."" He says cooly, as he sits. 



""Mind if we snog back here, Mycroft?"" John asks, climbing in and clambering over Sherlock so he sat between the two brothers. He turns his back to Mycroft, pressing his arse against the man's thighs, and grabs Sherlock's face with both hands.



Sherlock, who'd been reaching for the door to close it, stops halfway to the handle and freezes for a moment. Then, when John's lips meet his he melts and fills the back seat of the car with a low growl. His scent grows stronger and overwhelms the sour stench of Mycroft.



Smirking, John settles back and says, ""Better, now I can't smell his lemony arse.""



Sherlock snickers and holds John close to himself.



Mycroft rolls his eyes. ""Children.""



""If we're children, then what are you? A toddler in an overgrown suit?"" John snarks back, feeling Sherlock's chest heave as he suppresses his laughter. 
""Why are you even here? We're not signing anything today, just getting a draft form so we can come home and compose our contract.""



""As I am the elder brother I have legal responsibility for Sherlock and therefore you both need my signature for the registration. Sherlock's lucky he has me or else Mummy would have had to come down and do it."" Mycroft rolls his eyes.



""Ugh, you Alphas and your legal responsibilities. Always have to own someone,"" John groans, sticking out his tongue making a gagging motion with his finger. ""When will you learn that people are people? No matter what their bodies or parts look like?"" 
He rolls his eyes and resists the urge to let out a giant fart. Perhaps beans on toast hadn't been his smartest idea to have with breakfast.



""There's no point in having this conversation with you, though. Men like you think that men like me are trophies, who should find it their privilege to be owned and used. After all, isn't it our honour to provide Alphas like you children, to enrich your status in this world?""



""Mycroft likes to feel self-important because he hasn't caved to Mummy's begging to bond."" Sherlock hums.



""Dr. Watson, I have no care for what society thinks people are worth. I work within the confines of a crumbling system filled with idiots and imbeciles. If it made any difference to me the whole cast system would be done away with just to save me the paperwork. Do you know why this system was put into place? Omega's wanted legal protection and alphas wanted to perpetuate status, on that count you are correct. But omega's agreed to it because they were not allowed to work, to have jobs, to own land, or have any claim to their own offspring. Being married offered the opportunity to be bonded so someone who may care about them enough to give them the life they craved."" Mycroft sighs as he looks out the window.



""Your assumption however that only alphas benefit from this system is false. Secondary sex doesn't matter. Do you know that some of the largest sex trafficking, excuse me, I mean match-making services, are run by omega's because match-making is seen as feminine and omega work? They exercise the little bit of power they have over others of their kind. Before you talk to me as if you know every in and out of this system think of those who I have to work to protect from the deepest darkest rankest holes of our society. I care not whether you're an omega or beta or alien for all that matter. As long as my brother stays clean and alive that is all the concern I have."" Mycroft gets out of the car when they arrive at the office.



""Huh,"" John says, watching as Mycroft steps out. He turns to Sherlock and whispers, ""Who shoved a dildo up his arse."" 
However, even though his brief spat of snickers, he can't help but feel a tiny bit of respect towards Mycroft. His words, of course, were true. Ever Omega knew the rumors, knew about the trafficking. It was a ghost story told at night to scare Omega children into behaving. The big bad boogie man designed specifically for one gender. 
Still, John didn't let it upset him. They, unfortunately, were not his problem. Him, a lonely Omega, albeit military trained, wouldn't stand a chance against the world's biggest trafficking ring.



""Right... Let's get this over with then,"" he says, sobering up and stamping down his desire to snark Mycroft Holmes to death.



When they arrive at their destination he follows Mycroft into the building, Sherlock on his heels. Mycroft's presence alone grants them a private waiting room, where a young Omega, no older than nineteen, offers them food and drinks. When the three of them decline, the Omega departs and leaves them alone to wait.



""Let's get one thing clear,"" John says in a low and dangerous tone, ""If I'm signing anything today, I'm going to need to agree with every damned word written on that paper. No loopholes, no clauses, no surprises.""



""I've made it very clear that you have the same rights and sovereignty as my brother. You've both made that clean."" Mycroft nods. ""All we're signing today is that you're registering with my brother and intend to become his mate. That is all.""



""Mate..."" John sighs and rests his head up against the wall. He could go into a tirade about that word, but he knows it's just the stress of the situation putting him on edge.



Sensing his mood, Sherlock reaches out and places a hand on John's knee. The contact is enough to calm the worst of John's anxiety, though his knee still giggles up in down with restless energy.



""Just passing legal rights from the military to Sherlock,"" he says out loud to no one in particular. ""Probably not a terrible choice. At least this way if I get stabbed by a crazed lunatic on a case we don't have to wait for some General to come sign approval for medical aid.""



Sherlock rubs John's leg. ""It'll give you more rights as well.""



""Yes, you'll be able to go out after dusk without a chaperone."" Mycroft rolls his eyes.



""Never listened to that one,"" John admits with a shrug. ""But, I've done my best to pass for a Beta as often as I could.""



After a few more minutes laps by, a door opens and an older Alpha walks in carrying a manila file folder. He gestures to the party and leads them into a small office. There are only two chairs, but neither Sherlock nor Mycroft object when John claims one of the chairs as his own. 
John fights the urge to speak. While they are deciding his fate here today, he knows things will go a lot smoother for them if Sherlock explains their reason for being there.



""I'm here to register with my flatmate,"" Sherlock says.



The officiate nods and pulls a few pages out of the folder. John's leg starts bouncing again as the weight of the situation settles over him. Sherlock sits beside him, his fingers brushing against John's arm where it lays on the armrest.



""Before you ask,"" John says, the words heavy and greasy on his tongue. ""We're not bonding yet, we'll be waiting for my next heat. We're simply here to register, and transfer my legal rights from the military to Sherlock Holmes, the man I intend to be my Alpha.""



The official pulls out a sheet, an official registration form for both of them to sign as well as a witness. 
Sherlock reads it over and signs. 
John accepts the paper and reads over the wording carefully. To his relief, it's all straightforward, no hidden meanings, no fancy wording. Just straightforward legal terms transferring his rights to Sherlock. 
Gripping the pen far harder required, he signs his name, the nib pressing in hard, leaving an indent. On a separate form, he jots down the information of his CO, and is told that the office will take care of contacting the army on Sherlock's behalf.



Sherlock's nose twitches in annoyance, and in a cold voice, he corrects the man. ""Not on my behalf, but on John's.""



John preens a little bit, and puffs his chest out. 
They're stuck in the office for a while longer, having been asked to fill out a bonding plan, Which neither of them had given much thought to. Mycroft steps out of the room, giving John and Sherlock a few minutes of privacy as they discuss what they wished to write. In the end, they leave the form as vague as possible. Simple copying John's words from earlier, that upon his next heat, they intended to bond. 



""I believe we're finished here."" Mycroft drawls, having entered the room with the government official. He signs on the witness line, then hands the paper back for official recording. 



John stands first, and walks off out of the office without waiting for either Alpha with him to lead. 
He gets out to the car and breathes a sigh of relief. For the second time in his life John has just signed his rights away. But, for the first time, he wasn't dreading an invisible threat, one that loomed over him with every breath he took. 
Turning to Sherlock, when his Alpha catches up, he walks up to him and wraps his arms around Sherlock's back. ""Thank you, for what you said in there.""



Sherlock holds John close and scents him. ""I'm sorry he was an ass. Mycroft is ripping him a new arsehole."" He snorts softly.



""God, I loathe that the thought that I'll have to show him my bond bite."" John sighs and lets his Alpha mark him. Sherlock's scent soon washes away the other Alpha's scent and it makes him feel better. Helps ground him.



""Alphas just don't like seeing an unbound Omega..."" He glances over to the car, then looks up at Sherlock. ""What are the chances we can just get a cab home? Or we could walk? I want fresh air, and to see the city again. I've been cooped up inside for too long.""



""We can walk. Mycroft will have copies sent to the flat."" Sherlock takes John's hand, leading him away from the building.


Poor John :( Having to give up his basic rights. Breaks my heart a little. -Tindo

Sherlock and John take on a case just before bonding... Will they survive the tension?


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


Two months later Sherlock a letter from the gardener who tended to his great grandmother's estate shows up on their front door Hand-delivered by a courier, who stood and waited for Sherlock to read it and give his response. Sherlock's grandmother had some of the most awarded gardens in the French countryside. Not only that but she had several colonies of bees that supported her garden and the local vineyards. Currently, both were being threatened. 



""John! We have to go to France! Start packing!"" Sherlock says from the living room as he reads the letter. Someone had been poisoning his great-grandmother's garden and the bees were dying in droves. Worse yet, it didn't seem to be limited to just his grandmother's hives and property. Before consulting John, 
Sherlock buys them first-class flights for that night.  The sooner he and John get to his grandmother's the sooner they could start working on the case. With any luck, no later than tomorrow morning. would be able to settle in and get working on the case first thing in the morning. 



After two days of investigating it becomes apparent that it wasn't only his great grandmother's garden that was being terrorized but the surrounding vineyards as well all at the expense of the local pollinators. If there was one way to piss off Sherlock Holmes it was the senseless murder of bees. Sherlock
 sits at the breakfast table on the morning of the second day, watching John eat as he goes over the facts of the case.



""We've ruled out rival vineyards and local exterminators."" He grumbles, irritated.



""How are the bees dying?"" John asks, trying to shake to sleep from his groggy mind. ""They're dying because their source of food is poisoned, right?""



Sherlock nods once and growls.



""How easy is it to produce the poison they're using? Need they be a chemist, or can your local run-of-the-mill druggy who's good at mixing make it?""  Unsued to seeing Sherlock apply emotion to his cases, he's tempted to remind Sherlock to keep a level head. However, despite the angry growling and fretful hairpulling, he finds Sherlock's emotional side endearing.  Plus, t
here's something about the fire in Sherlock's eyes that makes John want to pull off every stitch of his clothing and kiss him better.



""Bees are delicate. Any run-of-the-mill pesticide can cause mass die-offs. That's why this is so frustrating. There are still too many variables."" Sherlock grumbles and crosses his arms. ""We'll have to go back to the vineyards and investigate again. I'll have to look closer at the hives.""



""Alright, but I'm finishing my damned breakfast first,"" John says, pointing his fork across the table at his Alpha.



Sherlock just rolls his eyes but doesn't tell him to hurry up. 
An hour later they're well on their way to the nearest vineyard. The overcast sky adds a gloomy feeling to the day. John finds himself focusing on Sherlock's scent in their rented car. 
The rental company did a good enough job of erasing the scent of the Alpha who drove it last, but pungent notes of stale seawater still find their way into John's nostrils.



""Give me your scarf?"" He asks, his stomach rolling. ""God he smells like low tide and rotting sea creatures.""



Sherlock takes off his scarf and hands it to John before unrolling the windows as he drove. ""Smells like they drove this thing off a pier and dragged it out six months later.""



They finally arrive at the nearest vineyard. Going through the building they wave at the manager who waves them to the back where the rows and rows of grapes were.



Sherlock walks between the rows, inspecting them. Then he goes to the hives. Out of the original five, only one and a half were barely hanging on. He couldn't see any damage to the hives themselves but there was a stain in the dirt.



Pressing Sherlock's scarf to his nose John silently follows Sherlock. He doesn't know what to look for but stays alert. 
Standing back, mostly to give Sherlock space, he paces a wide circle around the hives, listening to Sherlock call out facts. 
On his third loop around the hives a spot of yellow catches his eyes. Taking a handkerchief out of his pockets he bends down and lifts up a small yellow pin.



Only a little bit bigger than a large button, the pin is simple. It has a yellow background and ""Free the bees'' written in black ink. Though, to his puzzlement, there's a circle with a red dash drawn with what appears to be a marker.



""Sherlock,"" he calls, taking care not to touch the pin. ""I might have found something.""



Sherlock goes to John immediately. ""Save the bees?"" He sounds confused. ""Why cross it out?""



""Mmm..."" John mumbles, sniffing the air as Sherlock gets close. ""You smell nice.""



He passes the pin over, then steps into Sherlock's space and begins nuzzling his face along Sherlock's chest, sticking his nose deep into Sherlock's armpit where his scent is stronger. 
""I missed you, when you were over there. That's silly, isn't it? I could still see you."" 



Sherlock wraps his arm around John as he looks at the pin. ""Grandmama's house smells old and musty, not like Baker Street that's saturated in us."" He kisses John's head. ""We need to talk to the manager and see if they know about the pin.""



John whimpers when Sherlock pulls away. His chest feels warm from their contact, though it quickly grows cold as Sherlock walks away, putting distance between them. 
With a small growl, he chases after his Alpha and catches up to him, breathing a sigh of relief to have Sherlock and his comforting scent back by his side.



""Think the managers in on this? Or are you just hoping he'll recognize the pin?'



""Possibly. Let's see if we can jog his memory. He told us that no one is allowed on the grounds that doesn't come through the building and they have electric fencing but there are show prints in the dirt that don't match the workers boots."" Sherlock wraps his arm around John's waist and keeps him close. 
""Marco!"" Sherlock calls out. ""Have you seen this before?"" He asks the manager when he comes over, showing him the pin.



As John listens to the two men talk he becomes aware of a new feeling settling in the pit of his stomach. 
Doing his best to both pay attention to Sherlock and the manager Marco, he almost doesn't realize it for what it is. 
Desire. Not just the normal desire he'd grown accustomed to over the past few months of their relationship, but a deep seeded desire he could feel all the way down to his toes.  
He wanted to claim Sherlock, he wanted to lick every scent gland and mark Sherlock as his. He wanted to come in his hand and smear his come over Sherlock's skin so every unbound Omega that passed Sherlock would know he was taken. 
He begins humming the tune to Billy Idol's Cradle of Love. The words echoing throughout his mind, and seeming to vibrate across his soul.




Yeah flesh for your romeo



Ah yeah baby



I hear you moan



It's easy, y'know how to, please me yeah




Sherlock gives him a scathing look, but when their eyes meet understanding flashes between them.



""As you can see,"" Sherlock says to Marco while still looking at John, ""John's heat is...he's going to be very heated,"" he corrects himself, ""if we don't find these men.""



""Yeah, I only start humming 90's rock music when I'm angry,"" John says, doing his best to keep a straight face, which isn't easy when Sherlock looks like he wants to find the nearest dark nook and tear John's clothes off.



However, Sherlock is drawn back to the case when Marco tells them about a group of young hippies who came by a few weeks ago. He kicked them out because they smelled like weed, (bad for a reputable business) and they kept asking if the wine the vineyard produced was with slave labor. He told them of course it wasn't and that they needed to leave because they were causing a scene.



""Slave labor."" Sherlock mumbles curiously.



""Tell me you can solve this quickly,"" John hisses as they walk away, ""I estimate we have a day and a half two at most, before my biology kicks in.""



""We'll go back to the estate and I'll make a list of vineyards that haven't been hit who boast about their own hives. We'll have a stakeout at the most likely one and finish this tonight. Hopefully."" Sherlock nods.



John nods once and grimaces as he nears the car. ""God, what did he do? Have sex in the backseat?""



Sherlock opens his mouth, about to answer but John sticks his finger out and says, ""No. Nope I don't actually want to know.""



The ride back to Sherlock's family estate is quiet. Sherlock thinks while he's driving, which John can't imagine is safe, but without a license there's little he can do. 
When they pull up the gravel drive he says softly, half stating, half still expecting he needs Sherlock's permission. ""Think I can get my license? When we get back to London?""



""Of course, John. It'll be much more practical for you to drive so I can think. I'm surprised the military didn't let you get one. Probably didn't want you running away with all your newfound freedoms."" Sherlock rolls his eyes and gets out of the car.



""Oh I could drive. Military status trumps everything else. I've driven tanks, trucks, hummers... Even had a funny little golf cart to get around on base. But in the civilian world I need that pesky little licence.""



The car comes to a stop and John is more than happy to step into the fresh air. The late afternoon sun feels warm on his face and he sighs. ""Should have realized this was coming. Remember on the plane I said I could smell someone chewing gum? My senses are working overtime. I bet, if a bound Omega who isn't on the cusp of their heat, got close to the car all they'd smell is chemicals.""



""It's a month early. I thought we'd have time for this case. I'm sorry."" Sherlock says softly, feeling awful that he's dragged John to another country to solve a case and now he's going into heat away from their home.



""Yeah well, my system is out of whack,"" John falls into step behind Sherlock as they head into the large house.



""Kitchen?"" He asks thinking that he can make an early dinner while Sherlock works out which vineyards need their surveillance.



""I should have accounted for that."" Sherlock sighs. ""Yes you should eat.""



""So should you. We won't be eating much in a few days. We'll both need as many calories now as we can manage.""



John doesn't leave room for Sherlock to argue. He quickly sets about making dinner, opting to cook a frozen pizza over something from scratch. 
While waiting for the oven to preheat he begins going over a mental list of everything they'd need if he was going to have his heat here.  
Taking stock of the fridge and its contents he begins a list.




Water bottles



Cheese



Fruits



Nuts


Cured meats



Once he gets a list started it flows easily and it's taking up a full page in his notebook. Figuring he'd gotten the gist of it he pockets the notebook and turns to Sherlock.



""You said vineyards, plural. Makes sense if I take one, you take the other.""



""Logically yes it makes sense but you're also going into heat and I'm not sure I'm comfortable leaving you on your own."" Sherlock frowns, looking up which vineyards are most likely to be targeted next. 



""I have my gun,"" John shrugs as he puts the pizza into the oven. ""Wouldn't be the first risky situation I've been in.""



""Yes I know that but I'm also supposed to have your back,"" Sherlock mumbles as he presses against John's back, breathing him in.



""Mm, but I'm a big boy,"" John says, leaving back into Sherlock and resting his head against Sherlock's shoulder.



""If we want this over tonight we should split up. What's the distance between them? Can we stay in touch through walkie talkies?""



""The properties are neighboring but the hives are on opposite ends."" Sherlock wraps his arms around John, scenting him.



""I suppose we could. When we see something suspicious we could alert the other to come over for back up."" He says, still not liking the idea of leaving John.



""Relax, Sherlock,"" John says, turning around and falling into his Alpha's embrace. ""We've done this loads of times. I dare say London is a bit more dangerous than a field full of grapes after nightfall.""



Preening under Sherlock's attention, he forgets to set a timer for the pizza. Eventually, Sherlock pulls his lips away from John's neck and whispers in his ear, 
""Ding."" It sends shivers down John's spine, but he manages to pull away and reach for the potholders. 

Sherlock watches John take the pizza out and cut it into slices. ""Fine but the minute you don't feel right or you see something you tell me.""



""Superpower, remember?"" He says, pointing to his nose once the hot pan is placed on the kitchen surface. ""I'll be able to smell trouble coming at me, and can have you by my side in no time.""



Unable to find a pizza cutter, John takes a large knife and cuts the pizza, grinning as he says, ""Hell hath no fury like an Alpha's whose unbound mate is about to start his heat.""



""Exactly,"" Sherlock smirks, impressed with John's cutting skills. ""I don't think that should be as arousing as it is.""



""Good, then have a slice.""


Here we goooooo tomorrow's update starts a fun story plot!

The boys stakeout to see who's been killing the bees...


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


They wait until dusk has settled around them before they leave. John double checks, then triple checks his gun, before sliding it into a holster he has under his jacket. 
When Sherlock cocks an eyebrow at him, as if asking where on earth the holster had come from, John just shrugs.



""I like to be prepared. Should have seen Mycroft's men scrambling to get my gun on the plane. I nearly peed myself laughing. I figured, if I was going through the trouble to get this on board, I'd bring my full kit.""



""I need to stop looking at you so closely. Everything you do turns me on."" Sherlock licks his lips as he looks John over. ""You accounted for the time change and took your contraceptive, correct?""



""Mm."" John nods while turning the volume on his mobile phone to vibrate only ""Had to change the alarm on my mobile, but I've been careful. As long as you somehow get me to take it during my heat, there shouldn't be any major surprises in a few months.""



""I'll drug you for your own good."" Sherlock chuckles, making sure he has his tools of the trade.



""Wouldn't be the first time you've drugged me... But for my own good?"" Laughing John slides into the car and groans as the scent of past drivers assaults his senses.



""So. Just to recap,"" he says, buckling himself in, ""Hide, watch the hives. Alert you to anything suspicious. Keep my distance, and do not engage. I'll stand upwind of the hive, in case any of them are Alphas. Which should also aid me in



scenting them first, as long as they don't approach me from behind."" 
John pulls two walkie-talkies out of a bag by his feet and checks their batteries. 
""Only use these for emergencies, keep the volume low, and try not to check in just to ask me how I'm doing. We have our designated check-in times, once an hour on the hour. If either of us is a minute late checking in, we call the local police.""



""I love a military man."" Sherlock groans happily as he drives.



""Now who's the sex-happy one in this relationship."" John chuckles and can't deny that he's thoroughly enjoying the slightly glazed look in Sherlock's eyes.



Sherlock drops John off along the edge of one of the vineyards, as close to the hives as the car can go. 
John climbs out, then walks around to Sherlock's door. He motions for Sherlock to lower the window, then leans in.



""Be safe, yeah?""



""You, too."" Sherlock pulls John in and kisses him before scenting him liberally. ""Don't do anything stupid. I'm just a call away.""



""Out of the two of us,"" John says, smirking and pulling away, but keeping his head low enough that he can see into the car, ""Who's more likely to do something stupid?""



Sherlock looks like he wants to argue and then shuts his mouth with a click. ""I have nothing to say on this matter."" He pouts.



""That's what I thought."" John laughs softly, then taps the roof of the car. ""Get going, you. Pick me up around 1. I'm not sitting out here all night."" 
He slings the duffel bag over his shoulder and turns without another word. Dressed in black, his slight frame disappears into the vines almost instantly.



Sherlock watches John go until he's out of sight and then heads to his hiding spot. At nearly midnight Sherlock hears footsteps, at least three people. He gets in position, wanting to catch them in the act. 
The evening passes slowly. Dark settles around John and the damp that comes with it. 
He keeps his gun tucked inside his jacket, resting the urge to feel its comforting weight in his hands.



It's probably just kids... he reminds himself. To pass the time he circles the hive every twenty minutes. Making sure to keep his feet silent, while staying alert for anyone or anything. 
He startles a rabbit, but other than that nothing happens. Until midnight.



He was just about to pull out the walkie-talkie to contact Sherlock for their hourly check-in, when two bobbing circles of light break through the evening just south of his position. 
Two minutes earlier than their agreed check-in time, he whispers into the radio



""Two lights, just out of earshot, over.""



He slides his gun out of the holster and flicks off the safety. John Watson, the person, might not be in any real danger, but John Watson the Omega close to his first natural heat in years... might be.



""Shit."" Sherlock stills as all three heads whip around to his direction, John's voice was quiet but they still heard something.  
One of them moves closer and Sherlock decides since his cover is blown he might as well use whatever little surprise he has left. He jumps out and knocks out the one closest to him.



""What the fuck!"" Yelps one of the others. Sherlock goes after him next, his radio clatters to the ground in the struggle with the button pushed down by a rock.



""Bastard!"" The third growled and picked up a plank of wood, cracking Sherlock over the head. The sound was sickening and Sherlock could feel his scalp split. He managed to knock out the second with blood in his eyes before the third could land another blow.



Wiping blood out of his face he could see the shirt the third was wearing. ""Free the bees? What does that even mean? They are free."" He growls as they circle each other.



""They are not! Trapped in those boxes and worked like slaves! All their honey is taken and they're left to starve!"" He shouts back.



Sherlock stops, maybe it was the concussion or the blood loss. ""Do you not know how beekeeping works?"" He says, sounding utterly confused.



""THAT'S just a fancy name for slave master!"" The third snaps back.



""Oh for Christ's sake."" Sherlock rubs a hand over his face. ""You're a bunch of animal rights activist idiots who don't even under animal husbandry."" He sighs.



John's blood goes cold at the sounds coming from his radio. Voices had crackled through the speaker, voices that did not belong to Sherlock. 
Then there had been the unmistakable sound of Sherlock in pain before the device went completely silent. 
John knows better than to waste time calling Sherlock's name. Stuffing the radio into his pocket he withdraws his mobile phone and dials the local police, pleased with himself for putting the number in his contacts before they'd left the estate. 
He relays what's going on in hushed tones, backing up so the people getting closer to him will have less opportunity to hear him. 
Once he's done calmly relaying the information over to the dispatcher, he shoves his mobile into his back pocket and runs a hand through his hair, tugging at the ends.



Think Watson he tells himself, willing the pang of panic to go away. I didn't hear a gunshot, didn't hear a vehicle... But that was Sherlock's voice crying out in pain, I'm sure of it.



He cursed himself, wishing they were bonded so he could have a better sense of if Sherlock was alright. 
Realizing that the lights had grown close enough that he could make out dim shapes moving towards him, he raises his lips in a snarl and stalks forward, gun in hand. 
He takes them both by surprise, tackling one, a young beta woman to the ground. Without muttering an apology he slams the butt of the gun into the back of her head hard enough to knock her out, then turns the gun on the other, a young alpha barely old enough to need to shave.



""Sit. Hands on your head,"" he snarls, placing one foot on the throat of the young woman. ""Or I'll crush her windpipe."" 
He has no intention of doing such a thing, but what the Alpha didn't know, wouldn't hurt him.



Sherlock grumbles as he ties the three idiots together and makes sure they can't get away. He picks up the walkie and finds that it's crushed. John! His mind screams. If John had been calling for help he wouldn't have been able to hear it. 
Before Sherlock knows it he's sprinting through the vineyard towards where he left John. His head is pounding and his vision is a little blurred, running mostly on his instincts alone. 
Panic wraps around the base of John's skull, cold and slippery. Worried about his Alpha's fate, he almost misses the flick of anger in the young Alpha's eyes when he realizes he's being held at gunpoint by an Omega. 
Channeling all of his anxiety into anger, John pulls the hammer back and cocks his head.



""Oh, I wouldn't move if I were you. I bet you that my bullet can move faster than you. Is that a bet you're willing to lose?""



The alpha growls something rude, but his string of derogatory remarks falls of deaf ears as John escapes into his mind where he's instantly welcomed by his own fear, wondering what happened to Sherlock. 
Sirens carry across the wind. And while they're still far away, it reassures John that soon he'll be able to go and find Sherlock. 
As they grow nearer, his stomach clenches, the first waves of craps rearing their ugly head.



Sherlock nearly trips through the clearing. ""John!"" He nearly tackles his omega, checking him over to any injuries. ""Are you alright? Are you hurt? Did they touch you? Are you okay?"" He rattles off questions, not seeing any injuries on John and he doesn't smell hurt.



John struggles to maintain his balance, and his gun arm, while Sherlock feels him up.  
He lets his Alpha check him over, knowing that Sherlock needs it as much as he does. He doesn't dare take his eyes off the young Alpha, but he sees something dark and shiny in the moonlight on the side of Sherlock's face and he can smell blood.



""Fine, love,"" John says softly, his foot slipping and pressing down a little too hard into the beta's throat. He corrects himself, and winces, knowing she'll have a foot-shaped bruise in the morning.



""If you don't mind though, I'm crushing this poor girl's throat. Mind getting the cuffs out of my back and taking care of this young prick while I make sure I haven't crushed her windpipe."" 
He risks one quick glance at Sherlock and growls, ""Then I'll be taking a look at you.""



Sherlock nods and gets the cuffs for the young alpha. He forces him down face-first into the dirt when he tries the struggle. ""This will hurt you way more than it will hurt me. I'm concussed, bleeding, and you threatened my omega. I could kill you and no jury would convict me."" He hisses.



John feels his face heat at Sherlock's words. He nearly forgets why he was bent over the female beta as a desire to tackle Sherlock to the ground and have him then and there threatens to override his logical side. 
Down, Lizard brain he tells himself, quickly walking Sherlock through the events as the sirens got close enough that their blue flashing lights cast strange shadows over the vineyard. 
The beta shows no sign of waking, so John motions to Sherlock once he's done fighting with the struggling man, and points to the ground.



""Sit."" He says, not caring one once if Sherlock's posh trousers get ruined by dirt. When Sherlock is sat on the ground he kneels in front of him and pulls his mobile out of his pocket.



Using the flashlight app, he holds the light up to Sherlock's face. He checks Sherlock's eyes for response time, and makes a satisfied grunt, then tilts Sherlock's head to the side. 
There's a large bump, and in the center a small split where something blunt had made contact with Sherlock's temple. Digging through his bag he pulls out a small medical kit and a water bottle. 
By the time he's done cleaning the wound, voices can be heard making their way towards them.



""Not deep, won't need stitches,"" John says softly, dabbing some ointment on the gash. ""But I'll need to clean and bandage it properly once we're back. I need more light to make sure I've gotten any foreign material out of the wound.""



""Alright."" Sherlock nods and stands as the police approach them. He tells them the owners had hired him and John against vandals and details what happened. He tells them where to find the others who should all still be tied together.



After explaining again and again and finally signing statements they're freed to go. ""You want to drive or me?"" Sherlock asks when they get back to the car.



""No way in hell I'm letting you drive,"" John says, holding out his hand for the keys.



""That's what I thought."" Sherlock passes over the keys. ""Don't go too fast. I may vomit.""



""Then you can vomit out the window, please, and thank you,"" John says, tossing his bag into the back seat and sliding in behind the wheel. 
Thinking fast, he gets out again, reaches into the backseat and dumps the contents of his bag on the floor, then passes Sherlock the bag.



""Better than nothing,"" he says softly as he got back in and started the car. 

Taking care to avoid the worst of the ruts in the dirt road out of the vineyard, he pulls out onto the main road.  
He drives a little faster than the speed limit, but slows down around corners, keeping his eye on Sherlock the whole time.  
When Sherlock starts to nod off, he reaches over with one hand and shakes his shoulder.



""Nope, no sleeping. Not until I have a proper look at you. Stay awake for me, Sherlock.""



Sherlock grumbles and does his best to stay awake. ""I was worried..""



""And you think I wasn't?"" John snaps back, then sighs, ""I'm not mad at you. Mad at them, for making me think something had happened to you. Sod the bees, sod their movement... All I care about is you. If something had happened..."" 
He trails off, unwilling to let himself finish that thought.



""Apparently I'm extremely hard-headed."" Sherlock says softly and rests his hand on John's thigh.



""Git,"" John says fondly, taking his hand off the gearshift for a moment to squeeze Sherlock's hand. 
""Scaring me into an early heat... I swear you did it on purpose.""



""I would have rather had more time to gather supplies and not have a head wound."" Sherlock snorts. ""How are you feeling?""



""Fine..."" John says even as a wave of cramps makes him wince. ""I've probably got twelve hours or so... long enough for us to catch a nap, then I can send you off to the shops.""



The estate looms in the distance and John breathes a sigh of relief when the gate automatically closes behind them. 
He pulls the car right up to the door and turns it off. 
He leaves everything in the car, except his gun, then heads over to Sherlock's side and offers to help him inside. 
Sherlock lets John lead him to the bathroom where the lights were the brightest so John can inspect his head. ""It was a piece of wood."" He says, knowing John's thinking what hit him.



""Mm, I'll check it for splinters,"" John says as he gets what he needs. He washes his hands, then puts gloves on. ""Tilt your head to the light for me?""



John takes his time, picking out small pieces of dirt and wood, then washing the wound clean.



""It really isn't as bad as it looks."" He says happily, putting more ointment on it and gliding his finger along the undamaged skin below the wound.



""I can bandage it if you'd like, but it's an awkward place, and the bandage will probably just slide off while you sleep. As long as we keep it clean, and watch it for infection, I think it's alright like this. But, your call.""



""It's fine. We'll just leave it. It's stopped bleeding so that's a plus."" Sherlock hums, liking the feeling of John taking care of him. He rests his hands on John's hips and presses his face to John's chest, breathing him in.



""Off to bed with you, then... I don't think there's much risk of a seizure, but I'll stay up for a little while and watch you.""



Sherlock starts to complain but John cuts him off with a shake of his head.



""Sherlock, I'm going to need you rested tomorrow, and fed. I don't think you understand how bloody exhausting it is to have sex for two or more days in a row. Non fucking stop. If you think your body hurts now, from that crack on your head... god you're in for something else.""



""Fine."" Sherlock sighs and starts to strip off his dirty bloody clothes. ""Only because you asked so nicely."" He teases.



""Humph,"" John grunts, shooing Sherlock out of the bathroom with a smile.



He slips into the kitchen and gets a glass of water, then detours back into the bathroom where he pops two painkillers out of their packaging.



""You'll be taking these, while I take my no have babies pill,"" he says, passing the tablets and the water over to Sherlock, who was in bed, though he was sitting up.



Sherlock swallows the pain medicine John hands him. ""Hopefully they kick in soon. I have a splitting headache."" He jokes.



""Ha.. ha.."" John says in a monotone. ""If I had a quid for every time someone said that to me, we could retire on our own private island.""



Still he smiles, and sits on the edge of the bed, brushing a few stray curls from Sherlock's forehead. While his intention is mainly of comfort, he can't help but watch Sherlock's eyes for any sign of something worse happening.



However, the pupils don't dilate, and his gaze remains clear and focused. After a few moments, John leans over and flicks off the lamp.



""I'll be back in a few... Need a shower."" He says, leaning forward and pressing a kiss to Sherlock's uninjured forehead.



Sherlock hums softly, leaning into the contact. He's still holding on to John when John tries to pull away.



""Oi, Alpha..."" John sighs, leaning over Sherlock and nuzzling their noses together. ""Let me go so I don't stink like Seawater Alpha and that young pup when you finally bond me.""



Sherlock makes a face and finally lets John go. ""Infantile little shit he was. Surprised he knew where to find his cock let alone use it."" He grumbles.



""I mean, he was with a beta..."" John calls as he finally breaks free of Sherlock's grip and heads back into the bathroom. 
""You can't tell me you didn't smell his spunk all over her?"" 
John leaves the door open and he begins to strip out of his dirty clothes. 
""Might know how to use it, but not well enough to please an Omega.""



A soft chuckle reaches John's ears. It creates a pool of desire deep within John and he wonders if his estimate of twelve hours was correct.



""What are the chances we can get some supplies dropped off? I already have a list."" He asks loudly as he steps into the shower.



""I'll have someone deliver whatever we need. I'm not leaving you again."" Sherlock settles against the pillows.



John showers quickly, but takes care to wash every inch of his body, washing off all forging scents.


Hey guys, Important note so please give this one a read

Accident and I updated the tags to reflect on future chatpers. There will be some non-con mentioned (thoughthe acts will never be described) We completely understand that non-con is tough for people, so we REALLY wanted to give everyone a warning. If it isn't your cup of tea that is 100% okay, and we love you dearly. Please stop reading after a certain doctor's appointment that will be in about 10 or so chapters. You can always find me on twitter (https://twitter.com/Tindo_on_AO3) and ask me to let you know when the chapter that mentions Noncon pops up, and when its over. I will be happy to fill you in on the cliff notes. 

please go ahead and give the new tags a read just so you are aware. I'll to be better at editing them as well!

Finally a bond....


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


When he steps out his skin is a blank template, ready to be scented by his Alpha until their bodies absorb each other's unique scents. 
He finds Sherlock still awake, his notebook laying open on the table beside his phone. Smiling, knowing that their needs will be delivered in the morning, John climbs into bed beside Sherlock.



""Hey..."" he asks after a moment when Sherlock turns into him and inhales deeply. ""What do I smell like, to you? You're all.. posh things, like leather and rich scents. Caramel sometimes, especially when you're angry. Other times, when you're just laying on the sofa in your mind palace you smell like vanilla. Do.. do I smell good?""



Sherlock smiles softly and leans in, smelling over John's neck and chest. ""Mm when I wake you early for a case or in the middle of the night you smell annoyed, a sour lime type smell but also a little sweet because you know a case is on. When you're having a bad day or your shoulder hurts you smell like gun oil and cold wind."" He mumbles, pressing kisses to John's skin. 
""When you're happy or I've complimented you it's like freshly baked cinnamon rolls dripping with glaze. And when you're turned on by something I've said or done. It's juicy and meaty. Something I want to sink my teeth into."" He murmurs as he kisses John's neck. ""There's always a base of warm stone as an undercurrent, strong and reliable. 
So yes, in short, you smell very good."" Sherlock licks johns scent gland teasingly



John shivers and his breath ghosts over Sherlock's face. 
""I want you to... to sink your teeth into me. I want you to make me yours, and you mine. I want to feel you through our bond, a constant reminder that we have each other, no matter what comes our way."" 
John points to a spot on the right side of his neck, just above one of his scent glands. ""Here, where it will show above my collar, so everyone can see it. ""



""Mm who knew my omega was an exhibitionist,"" Sherlock smirks, licking and sucking on the spot John points out.



""Public sex is great, don't knock it until you've tried it."" John half says half moans, then in a more alert tone adds, 
""At one pm I need to take my pill, remind me tomorrow Sherlock. I have an alarm set on my mobile, but I think it's still in my coat pocket... and I don't remember where I threw my coat when we came in.""



""I'll remind you,"" Sherlock mumbles as he kisses John's neck.



""We'll need..."" John continues, trying his hardest to think through the overwhelming presence of Sherlock, ""breakfast. Something full of calories and protein without being too heavy. Eggs, with cheese or something, and lots of liquids. When your knot swells in me... stay with me. Just hold me through it. It won't hurt me as long as you don't pull out before it naturally goes down.""



Sherlock hums something and noses his way to the other side of John's neck, licking along the scar tissue on his shoulder.



""You're distracting me... You might have a headache in the morning, but..."" he flushes a brilliant shade of red and says hoarsely, ""my slick can cure it. It's designed to help an alpha heal, in case of injuries before a heat.""



""Isn't that convenient?"" Sherlock mumbles, pressing John into the bed as he licks his neck and chest, pressing his nose to his armpits.



""Is... is there anything else I'm forgetting?"" John says while gasping for breath. Sherlock's hair tickles his chest, his tongue is warm and wet as he glides over his body. 
Though not fully in the throws of his heat, his cock is hard and he doesn't need to look down to know that Sherlock's is as well.



""Mm heating pad for cramps,"" Sherlock mumbles as he licks John's nipple.



""I shouldn't need it. Not as long as you're here and willing to fuck me."" 
John winces as a cramp yanks the words out of his mouth. ""Oh... you mean for now... right.""



Sherlock nods and moves lower, kissing John's stomach. ""Let me get you a hot water bottle. The order should be here in the next hour or so.""



""Alright."" John nods and lets his hands slide from Sherlock's back. 
The bed seems empty without his Alpha, and he finds himself wanting to cry until Sherlock's footsteps head back towards the bedroom. 
John lifts his head and sighs at the sight as Sherlock comes back to him. 
Tall, pale, eyes flashing with lust, and his powers of deduction are focused on him, and him alone. 
Sherlock is like a statue of marble. Beautiful, elegant while at the same time hard and unmoving. 
John's heart raced at the knowledge that against all odds Sherlock was here with him now, willing to entwine their lives together in a way that couldn't naturally be broken.



""When I said twelve hours..."" John whispers, ""I might have been exaggerating.""



""I think I'm more than partially to blame for that."" Sherlock rests the warm water bottle on John's stomach and cuddles him.



""Good, then *you* can do something about it as soon as my body starts producing lube. Until then, get some sleep. We're going to need it.""



Sherlock nods and pulls John to his body, cocooning them in their blankets. He scents John, covering John in his scent. 
Once John would have thought it impossible to fall asleep while every inch of his body was being nosed and kicked at. But his body knew what was coming, and it knew he needed rest. 
He drifted off with Sherlock's nose brushing against his side around two am. He doesn't wake until the sun is well up. Opening his eyes he groans and attempts to sit up. But something heavy is holding him down.



""Oi... Need the loo."" He croaks, wondering if Sherlock got any sleep at all, or if he'd been up all night scenting him. But a glance at Sherlock shows half of his curls matted down and sleep lines on his face from the pillow.



""Loo, then food first,"" he says softly, doing his best to ignore how badly his body demanded he simply spread his legs and beg for it. 
He takes care of his physical needs quickly, opting for cold pizza rather than warm eggs and toast. He even takes the slice of pizza to bed with him, the thought of not being by Sherlock's side suddenly unthinkable. 
When the pizza is gone he starts to lick his fingers and looks over at Sherlock, ""I think it's time, don't you?""



Sherlock nods, pulling John back to him again. ""How would you like to do this?"" He nuzzles John, running his nose along John's.



""Your cock inside me should be fine."" John quips. ""Wouldn't you agree?""



""Really? Is that how it works?"" Sherlock snorts, running his hand over John's side.



""Usually, yes,"" John says with a laugh. He appreciates Sherlock's uncertainty. This is new for both of them, and while he isn't afraid of messing things up with Sherlock it is still a bit awkward. 
""Why don't we just... Kiss? I want you to embrace being an Alpha. Enjoy this, because my heats are the only time you'll be hearing me beg for you to fill me up.""



John lays flat on his back and pulls Sherlock on too of him. Sherlock's cock sits heavy against his thigh as he drags his hands down Sherlock's back. 
They kiss, slow and soft at first. Each of them testing the waters of this new situation. It's different this time, knowing that they'd come out the other side as a bonded pair. 
Slowly the kisses turn into rough love nips, Sherlock's canine teeth descend and scrape along John's jaw, across his neck. He sucks at John's pulse point, just beside where John said he wanted his bite



""Wait to bite me until you've knotted me. I hear it won't hurt me if you do it then.""



Sherlock nods, sucking gently on John's scent gland and snaking his hand down, reaching down to feel at John's slick.



""Oh god!"" John cries out when Sherlock's fingers slide over his hole. Sherlock chuckles softly, his voice coming out like melted chocolate. Rich and smooth.



Sherlock dips his fingers inside John, coating them in slick, then brings his fingers to his lips. 
John watches, his cheeks burning hot as both embarrassment and arousal course through him. 
Sherlock licks his fingers, sucking John's slick from them. 



""You taste so good. I bet you feel even better."" He chuckles, low and deep.



His big hard alpha cock pulses against a John's tight, eager to fuck his omega. He leans in and kisses John deeply, wrappings John's legs around his waist. He rocks his hips slowly, rubbing his cock against John's.



""Do you want me to fuck you, John? Sink every inch of my cock inside you? Knot you and pump my seed as far as it will go?""



""God, yes... Please, Sherlock. Be the first and only one to fill me with your knot.""



John rakes his fingers down Sherlock's back and groans. For the first time in his life, he feels the tip of an Alpha's cock press against his hole. 
However, instead of thrusting in and instantly claiming him, Sherlock hovers as if frozen in time. Their eyes meet and there's a hint of a question in Sherlock's expression.



""Take me,"" John grunts, thrusting his hips forward and crying out as Sherlock eases inside him.



""Christ!"" John shouts, his nails digging into the flesh of Sherlock's hips as a rush of slick pours from him like a waterfall. ""Oh.. my god.""



Sherlock slowly pushes all the way into him. He stills, letting them both get used to the feeling. He whimpers softly, never having felt anything like this before.



He pants, holding himself above John. He wasn't sure what to do. ""What do I do, John? I.. I don't know what to do."" He says softly.



His instincts tell him to rut and thrust and claim and while that may feel good he doesn't think that's good. ""I want to please you. Take care of you. What should I do?""



John softens his grip on Sherlock's hips and lets out a sigh. Sherlock felt amazing inside him, satisfying him like no toy had ever been able to satisfy. 
With a smirk, he closes his eyes and seeks out the switch that allows him to change the intensity of his pheromones. 
This close, and already connected, it takes less than thirty seconds before he can see the change in Sherlock's expression. His eyes cloud over and his mouth gapes open and his nostrils flare. 
Bracing himself on his right elbow, John hooks a leg around one of Sherlock's and flips them with ease so he's on top. 
He places Sherlock's hands on the iron bars of the headboard and wraps Sherlock's fingers around the bars.



""Hold that, and don't let go."" he says in a seductive voice, bending low and hovering his lips mere centimeters away from Sherlock's lips.



When Sherlock leans forward, attempting to press their lips together in a kiss, John plants a hand on Sherlock's chest and pushes him back to the bed. 
With one hand braced on Sherlock's chest, the other on the headboard, John gets one leg underneath him and begins to fuck himself on Sherlock's cock. 
He wants to touch himself or have Sherlock touch him. But he doesn't, he denies himself touch, curious to see if he could come just from riding his Alpha's cock.



""When your knot swells, you can let go."" He says through heaving gasps for air as he bounced up and down, taking Sherlock's cock fully into himself with each thrust.



Sherlock moans as he watches John, enraptured by his omega. He plants his feet on the bed and thrusts up when John comes down.



""My omega. Mine. So hot. Perfect. Mine. Mine always. Just for me. I'm yours, John. All yours. Always. Hate being away from you. It hurts. Makes my insides cold. Don't leave me. Please. I'll be good. I'll be so good to you. Whatever you want it's yours. Whatever you want to do I'll support you. Anything. Anything."" He rambles.



""Mine...""John growls back, his body arching as Sherlock's cock slides over his prostate. ""My Alpha... Mine. Fuck me like you want me.""



The nails of his left hand dig into Sherlock's skin, not hard enough to draw blood, but they leave red welts along Sherlock's pale skin as his hand slides from Sherlock's collarbones to his stomach.



""I'm going to knot you and bite you. Bonding us. Keep you with me. Always. So good John. You feel so good."" Sherlock groans, rocking deeper.



His instincts are telling him to pin John underneath him and take everything he can. He ignores them in favor of watching John fuck himself on his cock. 
John's thighs begin to burn, but he ignores it. His physical discomfort is nothing compared to the pleasure he's getting from his Alpha. 
Sherlock's words sink deep into his mind. Creating a memory that he knows will last a lifetime. 
He pulls his right hand down from the headboard and places it on Sherlock's chest, crying out as he fucked himself harder on Sherlock's cock.



""I'm, God I'm close. Oh god, please, Sherlock.. now.""



In one swift calculated move, Sherlock turns them over and somehow keeps the pace John had going. He sinks his fingers into John's hair and gently tugs his head to the side. 
Sherlock's knot starts to catch and with one snap of the hips, he knots John and sinks his teeth into the spot John had pointed out, bonding them together. 
There's no fear, no last-minute regret, or any negative thoughts. John lets Sherlock pull his neck to the side, and watches with hungry eyes as his Alpha surges forward. 
The slightest pinching sensation registers in John's senses, but it's no worse than a shot, or getting a sliver. Though he feels muscles tear as sharp teeth sink into his neck, he doesn't cry out with pain or have flashbacks of the bullet sinking into his shoulder. 
Instead, he moans, and with hot pulses comes against Sherlock's stomach. He can feel Sherlock, just inside him physically, but in his mind. 
There, inside him, is a piece of Sherlock floating in his consciousness. He can feel Sherlock's emotions, feel the pleasure his Alpha is receiving from his body. 
Sherlock's tongue laves over the area between his teeth, his saliva numbing John's neck. He nuzzles the side of his face against the top of Sherlock's head and whispers.



""Finally... there you are."" John breathes, running his hands through Sherlock's hair.



Sherlock gently licks at the bites, his instincts telling him to clean and heal his mate. ""Okay?"" He mumbles softly.



""Quite alright, actually."" John grins lazily as his hands roam across Sherlock's back. 
""Did... did you come? I admit I was a tad preoccupied to notice.""



He wiggles his hips, testing the feel of his first knotting experience. With a grin he pushes back against Sherlock, pushing the knot deeper inside him.



""So much better than that toy. I can feel your heartbeat pulsing through your knot.""



Sherlock groans as John pushes back against him, squeezing more cum from him. ""It would be next to impossible not to come with you."" He chuckles a bit breathlessly.



""How does your neck feel? It's not bleeding too badly."" He asks, looking at their bond mark and feeling a swell of pride.



John purses his lips and rolls his neck from side to side, then shakes his head.



""Fine. I can hardly feel it. Well,"" he says softly, ""I can feel it, but there's no pain. I can feel you, like you're a part of me. Like... oh god, you're my jiminy cricket.""



John starts to laugh, deep laughs that leave him gasping for breath. He can feel Sherlock's pulse inside him with every shake of his body, but he can't stop.



""You're the bloody cricket telling me what to do.""



""The feeling is mutual."" Sherlock chuckles softly, nuzzling John. ""It's nice. I.. I like it.""



John's emotions level out and come back to some sense of normal. He stops laughing, wiping a tear from the corner of his eyes, and apologizes. 
""Sorry... I've read that Omegas can get emotional after a bond. but... I didn't think they meant I'd be laughing my arse off while I have a cock shoved up my arse.""



""It's alright. I like hearing you laugh. And it squeezes my knot."" Sherlock snorts, relaxing.



""I'm probably crushing you. Do you want to roll over so you can lay on top of me?""



""No... no.. I like this. You feel nice on top of me."" John says while nuzzling around Sherlock's neck. He smells like sweat and sex, but now underneath the scents John had come to think of as Sherlock there was something new. Something sweet, like coming home to find freshly made baked goods waiting for you on the table. 

When you're happy or I've complimented you it's like freshly baked cinnamon rolls dripping with glaze.




""Ohhh..."" John sighs, breathing in a lungful of the new scent. ""Oh... I.. that's me, mixed with you, isn't it?""



""It's you."" Sherlock smiles softly and kisses John tenderly.



""Fantastic..."" John mumbles around soft kisses.

          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

They lay like that for some time. Eventually, Sherlock is able to pull free. He moves away, though he doesn't move far, and lays on his side watching John.

Slick and Sherlock's come oozes out of John. For a moment he wants to reach for a flannel and clean himself off. But he's hard again, and he knows Sherlock won't be far behind.

""This time... be rough with me. We can test how sturdy this bed frame is."" Rolling onto his side John reaches out and begins coaxing Sherlock's erection back to life with his fingers. ""Is it even a first heat if something doesn't break?""

""I'll take you properly this time."" Sherlock groans, his cock thickening at John's touch. He kisses John again and presses him back to the mattress. ""If it's too much just let me know."" He mumbles against his lips.

Sherlock kisses him some more and decides he wants John's on his hands and knees to take him from behind. Or maybe he wants to pin him to the wall and fuck him hard enough to makes the frames on the wall rattle. ""Would you rather I take you from behind or hold you up as I fuck you against the wall?""

""Why not both?"" John says as his heart flutters in his chest. ""Why not... against the wall, first? Before we're too tired to stand up?""

""Mm good idea,"" Sherlock smirks and gets up. Before John can protest Sherlock scoops John up. He carries him a few steps and presses John to the wall.

Sherlock kisses John deeply and wraps John's legs around himself. ""You may want to hold on."" He growls softly and slowly pushes his cock into John's slick dripping hole.

""Fuuucckkk!"" John cries and throws his arms around Sherlock's neck for support.

""So fucking big..."" John growls, dragging his teeth over Sherlock's exposed neck. ""So hard inside me. God, it feels so good. If only you were there, during my first heat.""

""I'll take care of you through the rest of them. You'll have my cock deep inside you making you feel better. Fucking you through your heat."" Sherlock slowly starts to thrust until he feels John relax and then sets a deep steady pace.

Sherlock's body is coated in a sheen of sweat, which allows John's cock to glide smoothly along Sherlock's stomach with every thrust. He leans his forehead against his Alpha's shoulder and begins to chant a series of curses and praises.

""Fuck, fuck... oh god, yeah, right there... Don't stop, Sherlock. God,"" he pants out. Suddenly he's overcome with Sherlock inside his mind. He can feel Sherlock's pleasure as if it were his own. With a tiny yelp, he comes hard, his cock trapped between Sherlock's writhing body.

Sherlock keeps thrusting, his knot filling out. He presses John harder against the wall and knots his mate, filling him with more hot come. He pants and holds John up, pressing kisses to his neck and shoulder.

""Mine,"" John says, pressing open-mouthed kisses to the pale expanse of Sherlock's neck.

""Mine,"" he repeats, scraping his teeth over Sherlock's scent gland.

""Mine,"" he says for the third time, then, without thinking, sinks his teeth into Sherlock's neck.

He's met with no resistance, despite his teeth not being sharp like an Alpha's. It's like Sherlock's scent gland had been made purposely with John's teeth in mind. John can feel the change instantly. His awareness of Sherlock becomes sharper. He can see the world in a different colour. Gone are the shadows of history as he looks around the room.

The carpet is worn in a line, and his mind instantly knows it's from ceaseless pacing. There are divots in the rug from where the bed had once sat two feet to the left. He isn't sure how he knows... he just knows. Slowly, he pulls his teeth out of Sherlock's skin and arches against the wall. Sherlock's neck is bleeding, and he knows what he needs to do to stop it.

""Bed... bed, now."" He hisses, pushing away from the wall with his elbows.

Though dazed, Sherlock stumbles back a few feet. Once Sherlock is flat on his back, John sits up and reaches behind him. He slides his fingers through his cheeks, and they come back coated in slick and come.

The doctor in him screams that this is wrong. That he needs to clean and dress the wound, then apologize for inflicting such a wound on his Alpha. But the Omega in him takes over, bashing the stupid doctor on the head and telling him to shut up. John places his sex-covered fingers over the wound and rubs their combined juices into the bite. Instantly it stops bleeding and part of his mind relaxes. He rubs a bit more in, then leans forward and begins lapping at the mess, cleaning Sherlock's neck until he's gotten most of the slick cleaned up.

""I... sorry..."" he mutters, ""Don't know why I did that.""

""Don't.. apologize."" Sherlock pants. ""Perfect. So good. I.. you."" He mumbles, overwhelmed by the new feelings and sensations. He can feel where John's body is sore, rubbing his hands over the spots and working out the strain. ""It.. You. You're in my head. I can.. I can feel you.""

""I... I can think like you..."" John screws up his face at the onslaught of thought. ""Sort of. It's... deafening. Is your mind always this chaotic?""

""Yeah. Sorry. Here."" Sherlock scents John, rubbing his face along John's scent glands. He knows how much John's scent helps calms his mind so he hopes his scent does the same for John.

""Oh... oh that's better."" John sighs as his mind calms down a bit. ""Sherlock... what happened? Is that because I... I bit you?""

""I think so."" Sherlock hums, gently pressing kisses to John's skin. ""I've never heard of an omega biting an alpha back. I'll do some research later."" He mumbles.

He can feel the heat from John's body, the need, and the longing. ""Having me close does help you, doesn't it?"" He asks softly, sounding surprised that he actually helped John feel better.

""It... it just felt right. One moment my brain was telling me that you're my mate. The next.. my teeth were sinking into you like your skin was made of butter.""

John nuzzles down against Sherlock's body, whimpering a bit when Sherlock finally slipped out of him.

""There's no pain, no cramps... I don't even feel sex-crazed. I just feel... happy. Like we've just decided to take a few days off to have sex for the heck of it.""

Sherlock chuckles softly and stills when the doorbell rings. He growls before remembering it's their order. ""I have to go get our order."" He kisses John before getting up.

""Bring me back a snack,"" John asks lazily, curling up on his side and dragging the blanket up over him.

""Of course."" Sherlock nods and pulls on a robe. He goes down to the door and collects the order, ignoring how the delivery boy looks at him oddly.

After putting away the things that need to stay cold, he carries snacks up to John. ""Here, John. Drink."" He passes him an electrolyte replenishing drink as he opens a package of jerky.

""Fuck... I was thirsty..."" John pants after downing the bottle in two gulps.

""You should drink one as well. Then... come here. I have a sudden desire to suck on your neck until the skin is purple beneath your bite..""

Sherlock stuffs a piece of jerky in front of John's face with a look that says Wait

""Fine.. fine.. I'll eat something so I don't pass out. But... I did just have a slice of pizza..."" he looks at the clock,"" Three hours ago.""

""And you've already burned that off from sex. Eat and drink and then you can do whatever you'd like to me."" Sherlock drinks another bottle, the cold liquid hitting his stomach.

""I was rather hoping,"" John says, sinking his teeth into a piece of jerky, ""That you'd have your way with me..."" He blushes scarlet, then continues, ""I want to be thoroughly taken... I want you to have every ounce of me, Take me like the Alphas in the movies, Sherlock.""

Sherlock raises a brow and considers it. ""Alright. I suppose I can loosen the reins a bit on the alpha side.""

He sits in the bed and opens a pack of chocolate-covered almonds. ""I'll call you my dirty little omega. Made for my cock. How you gag for my cock. How desperate you are for me. How you're gushing slick for me.""

A shiver runs down John's spine. With wide eyes, he nods his head.

""Just for you..."" he says softly, pinching a nut from Sherlock's palm. ""I want those things, just from you.""

Sherlock leans in and nuzzles at their bond mark. ""You waited for me. Just for me, omega. You knew I'd find you eventually. Make you mine. Bond you. Knot you."" He mumbles. ""Love you.."" He adds softly.

John's heart stops beating for a moment then he lets out a long drawn-out sigh.

""Love you too. I'm glad you're my first. This is so... intimate. I can't imagine spending a heat with someone, then having to just... casually see them around.""

Sherlock closes his eyes, memorizing John telling him he loves him.

He hums and nods. ""It's too much almost. So many feelings and thoughts and sensations. Yours is.. comforting. Knowing you. Hearing you. I can't believe people can do this with total strangers.""

""Neither can I,"" John says, shaking his head. ""The risk of coming through bonded besides the fact... It's one thing to have sex, another thing to actually crave a cock.""

John dips his hand into the bag of jerky and takes out another piece, then pushes Sherlock to the bed. He pops the jerky into his mouth and straddles Sherlock's hips.

""Need you, now...""

""Oh? Do you?"" Sherlock chuckles as he watches John chew. He reaches down and strokes John's cock. ""My horny little omega. So needy for me. For my cock.""

""I don't just need your cock, Alpha... I need you to fill me with your cock and seed. Someday I'll beg you to pump a pup into me... for now..."" John pants, sliding Sherlock inside him. ""For now, fuck me like you're trying to breed me anyway.""

Sherlock growls softly and rolls them, pressing John to the bed and kissing him deeply. ""You want that? To carry my pup? To watch your body swell and grow my offspring?"" His words are a growl, deep and demanding. This, talking of pups, makes his alpha howl and want to rut, to breed his omega. ""You'd look so good carrying my whelps. Watching you waddle around the flat. Nesting and preening. So pretty for me. I'll make you fat with my pups. You love it. Built for it."" Thrust after powerful thrust he delivers.

""Oh god..."" It's all John can do to brace himself against Sherlock's chest. He hunches forward and lets his Alpha take him. Suddenly Sherlock's hands are grabbing his hips and he's being pulled off before his Alpha can knot him. John whimpers, and begins to protest. But he's shoved roughly onto the bed, where he falls face first. Strong hands grip his hips once more, lifting his arse up into the air. John gets the hint, and shuffles his knees underneath him until he's kneeling, then Sherlock's cock is back, hot and heavy, and thrusting deeper than before.

""Fuck"" John shouts, his voice echoing off the walls.

""My omega. Mine. Bonded to me."" Sherlock grips John's hips, pounding into him fast and deep. He angles his thrusts to rub John's prostate as he wants to fill the deepest place he can inside John.

""You want that, don't you? For me to knock you up. You're made to carry my pups."" He thrusts harder, the headboard slamming against the wall.

""Oh god... two or more at once... Yes..."" John pants out, his voice is broken and raspy. ""Alpha pups, Omega pups... inside me. Please Sherlock... fill me.""

""Come. Come for me, omega, and I'll knot you. Fill you with my seed. Make you swell."" Sherlock growls and leans over John, nipping at his ear.

""Yes..."" John breathes. He ruts his cock against the bed, finding just enough friction to come. He cries out Sherlock's name, his muscles clenching around his Alpha and collapses against the bed

Sherlock drives his knot into John and comes hard, his cock pumping his seed deep into John.

Once he catches his breath he pulls back a bit and lays them on their side. He holds John close and kisses his back. ""I've got you. I'm right here."" He says softly, something telling him to reassure John.

""Mmmmmm..."" John hums, resting his back against Sherlock's chest.

""This is nice too... But I do like Big Bad Alpha... it's kind of hot.""

""I'll work on the persona."" Sherlock chuckles softly.

""How would we do this... my heat, if we had kids?"" John wonders aloud as they lay there. ""I wouldn't ask Mrs. Hudson to watch them.. not for days on end. And I'm sure as hell not leaving them to roam the flat on their own, or send them off to daycare...""

""Molly and Lestrade could help."" Sherlock hums. ""If we get desperate there's Mycroft."" He grumbles.

""What about your parents... when we were there for the party, your mother said something about babysitting..."" John had rolled his eyes at the time but now, it was a real consideration. Accidents could happen, and he'd certainly been filled with more than enough come to get him pregnant.

""What time is it? I need to take my tablet soon I think.""

Sherlock looks at the time. ""Twelve minutes."" He hums. ""I suppose my parents could. If we have pups your heat will be delayed until they're weaned.""

""Oh god, I'd get breasts...well, sort of."" John groans, then he stops as a flash of desire that's not his pulses through him. ""Really? It would turn you on if my nipples puffed out with milk?""

Sherlock blushes a bit. ""I may have considered suckling."" He mumbles.

""Hmm... well."" John laughs, a bright and crisp sound in the stillness of the house. ""We'd need a bigger place, eventually. What if I have four the first go? God... my hips hurt just thinking about it.""

""We can't leave Mrs. Hudson on her own."" Sherlock frowns. ""My grandmother did leave me a large estate outside the city.""

""Then we take her with us, and hire a property manager for the flat... we'll fix up upstairs..."" John stops and slaps a hand over his face. ""God, I'm pre nesting... I'm sorry. I think my hormones are just completely haywire.""

""You've nothing to apologize for."" Sherlock nuzzles behind his ear. ""It's good to have a plan just in case. Besides we have time before we want pups."" He hisses softly as his knot goes cock, his cock slipping free.

""I'll get your pill. We can take a shower and I'll change the sheets."" Sherlock gets up and gets John's pills.

""Jesus..."" John looks down at the state of the bed for the first time and gapes. ""There isn't a dry patch to be found...""

When Sherlock comes back he already has the sheets stripped and balled up in the corner of the room. He takes his tablet, and downs another bottle of water, then drags Sherlock into the bathroom for a much needed shower.

""Just... two more days of this. Hopefully just two more days of this."" He says, as hot water hits his face.

""I'll be here with you however long it takes."" Sherlock says softly and starts to wash John's body, being gentle with the tender spots and making sure John is clean.

Here begins our fun little plot twist!

Sherlock and John head home from the case newly bonded...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

London is a breath of fresh air as John steps out of the rental car. Everywhere he looks, he sees the city with a hint of how Sherlock must see it. People are more defined, their emotions on display for him like actors overplaying their roles.

He grabs their bags out of the boot and winces. His muscles are sore, and he has more than a few scrapes and bruises. Sherlock is no better.

Between the left half of his forehead being one giant bruise, and the fingernail marks John knows are beneath his well-tailored suit, neither of them are 100%.

But still, they share a smile as they pass the keys to the guy from the rental agency.

""Home,"" John says, shouldering his bag and looking up at the flat and sniffing the air. ""Mrs. Hudson is baking. Scones, I think... Did you tell her we were on our way home?""

""I called her this morning when you were making sure everything was in the car."" Sherlock nods. He resists the urge to take John's bag, knowing John wouldn't like him taking it, implying that he can't handle his own luggage.

""I suppose we're going to have to tell her we bonded."" Sherlock hums, knowing that even though Mrs. Hudson is a beta she's still smart as a whip and she'll figure it out just by looking at them.

""I suppose we should. This is rather noticeable,"" John says tilting his neck to the side and showing off his bond mark. It rested just above his collar, and while his coat partially hid the mark it would be quite obvious once his coat was taken off.

John feels a rush of pride surge through him from the bond and smirks when a low growl resonates in Sherlock's chest. He loves the way his Alpha feels when he sees the mark. It makes him feel safe and cared for.

""Let's get these upstairs and we'll tell her when she comes up to investigate how our trip went."" John suggests, wanting to put the case down once and for all to give his abused muscles a break. 

They head upstairs. Out of habit John heads towards the room upstairs but stops and turns to look at his mate. ""Seems a bit silly to have separate rooms now, if we're bonded. Don't you think?""

John had spent a good portion of the last two months in Sherlock's room, though they still maintained a bit of distance. When Sherlock was working on a case, or simply restless, John would go upstairs so the Alpha could prowl the flat without fear of waking him.

Sherlock nods. ""We'll use the downstairs room for sleeping and whatnot since it's on the main floor and close to the bathroom. The upstairs bedroom will before storage and loud sex."" He smirks and tugs John to the main floor bedroom so they can put their things away.

After everything is put away Sherlock hears Mrs. Hudson's familiar footsteps on the stairs. ""Yoo-hoo! Boys? Are you decent?"" She calls.

""Yes, Mrs. Hudson. Come in."" Sherlock chuckles softly, wondering if John can feel the warm feeling Mrs. Hudson gives him.

John steps out of the bedroom and watches their landlady closely. It takes her less than thirty seconds to see the bite. Her eyes go wide and Sherlock has to step to her side and take the tray of scones from her before they fall as she brings a hand up to cover her mouth. She looks from John to Sherlock, then back to John's neck. Having spent so many years running from his biology John feels a prickle of anger pulsing through him and he clenches his jaw. But then something warm and comforting passes through the bond and he's relaxing. Their landlady utters a noise that's half squeal half shock. But then she gathers herself, takes motions for Sherlock to put the tray down on the table.

""Sick..."" She mutters, remembering Sherlock's excuse from John's last half heat. ""Sick... Mhm. I was a fool to believe that one.""

""It wasn't my information to tell,"" Sherlock says softly. ""And you know John is still John. This doesn't change anything."" He says even though she's the one who taught him that everyone is equal no matter their secondary sex classification. ""Well I mean all that's changed is I'm his mate now."" Sherlock smiles proudly. ""I'm John Watson's mate.""

""Yeah, he's my mate."" John repeats then reaches for a scone. ""And thanks to him I'm starving. We didn't exactly stop to eat much the last few days.""

""I fed and watered you as much as you'd allow me to."" Sherlock snorts and turns in the kettle.

""I'm just happy you boys finally figured things out. I was so worried you'd never get here."" Mrs. Hudson coos.

""Wait..."" John turns and brandishes his scone at the lady. ""You knew. You knew I was an Omega. How? Even Sherlock didn't know at first.""

""John, dear, when your husband runs an international drugs and weapons transport ring you learn how to tell if someone's hiding something very quick."" Mrs. Hudson smirks.

""I'm sure the exotic dance career has nothing to do with it."" Sherlock quips.

""Bite your tongue, young man."" Mrs. Hudson tsks.

John chokes on his scone but wisely says nothing about the video he and Sherlock had stumbled across.

Eventually, they're left alone and John immediately crosses the room and wraps his arms around Sherlock. He buries his head in the folds on Sherlock's suit and mutters an apology.

""My first reaction is anger when people see me as an Omega. I'm sorry... But I need you to know it has nothing to do with your status as my mate. I just hid it, for so many years. It'll take some getting used to, being out in the open like this.""

""You don't have to apologize, John. It's a very raw visceral feeling when people see you as less than or incompetent because of who they assume you are. I see you as John first and my mate second. Omega isn't even in the top ten list of things I associate with you."" Sherlock holds John close and scents him, letting John know he's forgiven even though there's nothing to forgive.

""Being seen as an omega can put you in a dangerous position. You've learned to defend and protect yourself. If you want to keep being perceived as a beta I have no problem with that. We can get something to cover your bond mark."" He kisses John's head but the mention of covering John's mark makes his insides squirm.

""I just want you to be safe and happy. However, you decide to do that I'll support you."" He rubs his hands over John's back.

""Cover it up? God.. no. I don't want to cover it up."" John says quickly, pulling away to glare at Sherlock as if he'd just suggested John run barefoot over a path made out of loose lego bricks.

""Why would I cover it up? I'm safe, now. I'm bound to you. Only you can smell my Omega side now.""

John has his head on Sherlock's chest when a faint tapping sound reaches his ears. He looks up and finds Sherlock staring at the door with a snarl on his face. John closes his eyes and heaves a sigh.

""Only been home ten minutes. Of course, Mycroft would pop over to say hello""

""Stay here and I'll go dispatch him. I don't need him dampening our new bond."" Sherlock nuzzles John before heading down the stairs.

He whips the door open and glares. ""Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me."" He hissed.

""What? What's that smell?"" John wrinkles his nose then Sherlock in hissing. Only, his hiss is made out of predatory instincts, rather than annoyance.

""You've got to be fucking kidding me."" He echoes, ""Doesn't that arsehole know its proper to give a newly bonded couple a month of privacy? Who's behind this, your brother, or the military?"" he wonders out loud

""I don't care. I want them gone."" Sherlock growls. ""Probably Mycroft. The military knows it would get a shit storm for infringing on a newly bonded pair. My brother pisses where he likes."" Sherlock goes down and opens the door.

""Go the fuck away."" He snarls at his brother and the lackey who's accompanied him.

The stench of two annoyed male Alphas assaults John's senses. Mycroft's sour citrusy scent nearly overpowers Sherlock's, making John want to whimper.

Instead, he grits his teeth and puts the kettle on. He purposely only fills it with enough water for two. He knows why Mycroft is here, and it isn't for a social call, or to wish the bonded couple well.

He's here to record proof of the bond. A picture of John's neck that will forever remain in his file. Proof for the government, so they know just how many Omega's they Don't have to worry about running about the city without a legal alpha.

If Sherlock is unsuccessful in getting rid of Mycroft, at the very least, John will show Mycroft just how unwanted his visit is by not making him a cup of tea.

""If both of you don't leave right I'll fight the two of you right here,"" Sherlock growls.

Three sets of feet make their way up the stairs. John lets out a resigned sigh and undoes the top three buttons of his shirt. Every Omega knows this scenario.

First: An alpha bites you, leaves his mark on you that you'll carry with you until one of two things happen. 1) you die, of old age or other means. 2) And this usually only happened to those who bonded to a friend or schoolyard crush in hopes that they wouldn't be sold off to another Alpha... they could (would be forced to) undergo a painful medical procedure that would chemically remove the proteins and enzymes given to the Omega during the bonding process, resetting the Omega back to their original state. If they survived the process.

Second: The newly bonded couple would, at the very least, be given one week to be alone, to strengthen their bond.

Thirdly: Between one week and one month, the bonded couple would go down to the registration office and their bond would be recorded. The Alpha would sign a paper stating that the bond was consensual. (Which 8 out of 10 times was a load of bollocks) and the Omega would be subjected to having his or her bite inspected. In the modern age, pictures would be taken of the bite, and a mold of the Alpha's teeth would also be gathered. The officiate would then file everything away, where most often none of the information would ever see the light of day again.

When Sherlock enters the room again, his eyes lit with righteous fury, John just gives him a sad smile and flicks his color away from his neck. ""Let's get this over with.""

Sherlock grumbles and sticks the tray of goo in his mouth to get his bite imprint, the whole time staring daggers at his brother and the official. The officiate takes the picture of John's neck and has them both fill out some paperwork. Sherlock pulls the imprint of his bite out and hands it over as well.

""I think that's all."" The officiant says.

""It certainly is not."" Sherlock unbuttons his shirt and shows the bite mark on his neck. ""This goes in the file as well."" He smirks when he sees Mycroft pale.

John has almost finished buttoning his shirt back up when Sherlock's words make his fingers freeze. Someone is stuttering, and John thinks it's Mycroft, but he can't tear his eyes off of Sherlock long enough to glance over at the other two men.

""Sherlock?"" John asks, eyes wide and his voice breathless, ""What are you doing?""

""If your bond mark is going on the file then so is mine. I bit you and you bit me back. I don't see why your mark gets to go in the file but mine doesn't."" Sherlock pulls his shirt over. ""Take the bloody picture already."" He snaps at the officiate.

Mycroft speaks first. With a flick of his hand, he motions the officiate forward.

""Best just do it. Neither my brother nor Doctor Watson will appreciate our interference at a future date.""

""Damn right we won't,"" John growls. As the man nears Sherlock and touches the bite (as if making sure it was real) John's lips pull back and he lets out a feral snarl. ""Take the damn picture and get out."" He hisses while moving forward. Mycroft stops him with a palm against his chest before he can get to Sherlock's side.

At first, the act angers John, he steps back and gives Mycroft a brisk nod. The thought of anyone touching Sherlock there makes him murderous, and he can't be quite sure what he'd do to the officiate if he'd been allowed to get any closer.

Once the pictures are taken, the officiate all but scurries out of the room. They hear him practically running down the stairs. Only then does Mycroft lower his hand. John rushes forward and pushes Sherlock up against the wall, rubbing his head across Sherlock's neck, then licking away any remnants of the other man's scent.

""Mine."" he purrs, once Sherlock smells like them again.

Sherlock holds John close and scents him and nuzzles. ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" He apologizes and then pulls back.

In one swift move, he slams Mycroft back against the wall, his hand tight around his throat. ""If you ever and I mean ever touch my mate again I'll rip that cold black shriveled organs from your chest where your heart should be. If you ever pull some bullshit like this again I'll tell Mummy about your arrangement with Anthea."" He snarls, his hand so tight around his brother's neck it's sure to bruise.

""By law, we're allowed one week, Mycroft,"" John seethes, coming up to stand directly behind Sherlock.

He looks at how Sherlock's holding Mycroft and gives his mate a satisfied nod. He's holding most of the pressure up just under his chin, no risk of crushing his windpipe. And probably no long-term damage to vocal cords. For once, the doctor in him doesn't care that he's witnessing another man in distress.

""Did you think I'd come out of this heat pregnant? Trying to... rush things along, are you? What was your goal, pulling this stunt?""

""Court- Marshal."" Mycroft manages to get out.

Sherlock frowns and drops his hand. ""What?""

""Court Martial over what? I'm not even bloody enlisted!"" John barks, and this time it's Sherlock who holds him back.

""What are they mad about? Me ordering that desk jockey around? That's his bloody job, to help Omegas like me. He messed up, miscalculated when I needed to swap brands.""

""A piece of legislation that was approved under the radar. After an omega who was registered with the military registers with an alpha, they have sixty days to have their bond filed or else the military assumes hold back over the omega and bonds that omega to an alpha without their consent. We're on day fifty-nine."" Mycroft rubs his throat.

Sherlock growls, angry at Mycroft and alphas in general.

""Fuck them..."" John growls and turns to the kettle. The water in it has long since gone cold. He adds a bit more water to it, then flicks it on again. This time with the intention of offering Mycroft a cup.

""Why didn't they tell me? I'm allowed that information. Fuck..."" He swears again and drags his hands through his hair. Anxiety at how close he'd been to having it all, just to lose it, makes him start to shake.

""When your legal responsibility is changed from the military to a civilian alpha they don't have to inform you of anything anymore since you are no longer their responsibility until they assume control of you again and at that point, they decide who to bond you with. After your service is concluded the only thing you're useful to for them is providing pups. Which if the alpha you're bonded to at the time is still active duty the pups become ward of the military that you get the privilege of raising for them."" Mycroft frowns.

John reaches up for a third mug and slams it down on the counter.

""My life, my body... not theirs."" He spins around and glares at Mycroft. ""You change the rules of the universe on a daily basis, it's like, squashing ants for you. Why hasn't this changed? Why are we property just because our insides are different?""

Mycroft offers him a sad smile but doesn't say anything. John just nods and turns back to fix the tea.

""Yeah, I know... money. People like being rich, and If I can produce them cute little Omega pups for them to sell off, why would they give me up."" The brothers both take milk and sugar in their tea. John fixes the three mugs then moves them to the table, motioning for the two alphas to sit. ""Calm down you two, I'd be able to smell you from speedies. Mycroft, have you ever seen... that, before?"" John motions to Sherlock's neck and shrugs.

""It was... instinctual, my body told me to do it, so I did it. We were too busy wrapping up statements with the French Police to look into it. We don't know if it will last, or if he'll have a mark. But both of our awareness changed. I see things like he does, sharper, with more clarity. My mind is a chaotic midfield of data. He... he smells things like I do, like an Omega now.""

Sherlock opens the kitchen window before sitting next to John to air the flat out.

""It,"" Mycroft thinks of how to word it. ""It's a sign of a perfect match.""

Leave a comment and let us know what you think!

Big brother leaves a parting message...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""It.."" Mycroft thinks of how to word it. ""It's a sign of a perfect match.""

""That's a real thing?"" Sherlock gapes, having heard the stories like all pups had about finding your perfect biological match.

""That's the only thing I can think of. I'll have to look into it more."" Mycroft sighs.

""Perfect match?"" John says, testing the words out on his lips. ""Meaning... he and I were supposed to bond? We were meant for each other?""

As soon as he says it, he knows it's right. Of course, it is.

""Alpha and Omega... beginning and the end,"" John says softly, reaching under the table to place a hand on Sherlock's knee. ""Revelation 22 can't remember the verse. But something about... give to each one according to what he has done.""

The brothers gape at him and John rolls his eyes.

""Didn't you two go to Sunday school? Out of context, because of course, that was talking about the end times. But... give unto each one what he has done. A bite for a bite. Fuck, it makes sense.""

John curls his free hand around his mug and stares at a spot in the center of the table. ""Can't imagine it's common, nowadays... Are there any others like us?""

Sherlock and Mycroft just stare at John, a little confused and surprised.

""It's rare. Very rare. Because the way omega's are sold off to the highest bidder it's very unlikely to be their true match. Those kinds of things have to develop naturally. Or so the story goes."" Mycroft shrugs.

Sherlock rubs a hand over his face, confused about all of this.

""If people only knew..."" John says a bit sadly, squeezing Sherlock's knee before scrubbing at his own face. ""This... is a whole new level of living. It's more than just an awareness of his moods and well-being. It's... like my brain is half him, half me.""

He sips his tea in silence after that, mind racing as he imagined a world where everyone knew about this possibility, and Omegas were no longer simply sold off.

Sherlock rests his hand on John's and holds it. He feels John's anger but also his profound sadness.

""I can't imagine the strength it takes to deal with him in your head."" Mycroft quips and sips his tea.

""I like it,"" John shrugs. ""It helped me stop him from punching the police this morning. Sherlock, we can't just keep what we have a secret. Is there anything we can do?""

""He does have a knack for getting into fights."" Mycroft muses.

""I don't know if we'd be believed. If anything it would make us a target if people who want to keep it hidden."" Sherlock sighs.

""Well, I'm not hiding it..."" John says, though deep down he's afraid that Sherlock is correct. ""I just won't make a blog post about it.""

""Mycroft, are you able to find out if there are any records, past or present, of Alpha's who have had bites on their necks recorded? They're public records... so it shouldn't be illegal."" Sherlock asks suddenly.

""I can look into it."" Mycroft nods.

""This could be grounds for law changes. It infringes on alphas bodily autonomy which is illegal. If an alpha's perfect mate is out there and it's sold off to someone else that could mean the alpha could sue for rights if the omega."" Sherlock frowns.

""But then we run into a major issue... How do you find your perfect mate? Matchmaking websites? Are there tests? Do we go back to the old ways, where an Alpha would court an Omega, and it was the Omega protected by the law?""

John mirrors Sherlock's frown and drums his fingers on the tabletop.

""Two hundred years ago, it was the Omega who called the shots. The courting rituals in their favour. Alphas could line up at their doorsteps and beg to court them, but the Omega could brush them off and walk away unscathed. We're all read those stories by our Omega parents. It ends with one Alpha getting mad that an Omega chose someone else over him, he caused a coup and brought the whole system down. I used to think they were just stories... but what if there's more truth to it?""

""We need to do research."" Sherlock nods.

Mycroft nods and stands. ""I'll do what I can and get the both of you as much evidence as I can.""

""Where do we even begin,"" John snorts, ""The library?""

He looks up at Mycroft as he reaches for his umbrella and offers the man a nod of thanks before watching him go. Turning back to his alpha he tilts his head and grins.

""We could go to the museum. Maybe if we look at old art, we'll see something? Plus, it would be nice to get out and stretch my legs after spending the last few days in bed.""

Sherlock nods. ""That's a good start. I also think we should talk to older omega's. It would be them who remember the stories passed down to them about having power over their lives.""

""Yeah, that sounds like a logical step."" John drags his hand through his hair and sighs. ""This... sounds dangerous.""

""I think for now we spend time together and recover. Strengthen our bond. And then we can take down the ruling bodies."" Sherlock hums.

""Well then, come strengthen it in the shower. Mm, no wait, the bath. We still have a bath bomb left."" John stands and heads down the hall, smiling when he hears Sherlock's chair scrape across the floor.

""Bring some wine, and the scones,"" he calls out as he steps into the bathroom. He looks at the tub and feels a wash of happiness. Since that first bath, when Sherlock had sat with his back turned towards him, the bath had remained free of experiments. As if, Sherlock had seen how much John enjoyed soaking in the tub and wanted to make sure John could do it whenever he wanted.

Sherlock brings wine and scones as John requests. ""Would you like to be behind me or me behind you?"" He asks as he strips.

""You've got the longer legs. Last time I was in back you looked like a grown-up in one of those battery-powered kiddie cars. You in back until we get a bigger tub.""

It's a bit of a struggle, but they manage to get into the tub together. John rests his back against Sherlock's chest and reaches for the wine. Sherlock has already uncorked it, so he pours out two glasses then passes one back to his mate.

""It's a bit weird, having you in my head all the time. But I think I'm going to like it. If we get separated on a case, I'll know you're safe.""

Sherlock nods. ""It makes me feel better. I feel more relaxed and not as worried about other alphas.""

John snorts then says, ""Means I don't have to worry about you doing something stupid. Like going off alone and getting yourself smacked over the head with a board.""

Sherlock prods John in the ribs, making him laugh and relent. ""That was my idea, wasn't it.""

""I suppose I ought to be more careful these days. I do have an omega after all."" Sherlock nuzzles behind John's ear.

Short chapter is short. We don't plan out chapter lengths. Just split them where it feels right. Tune in for more tomorrow!

John runs into Harry at the park...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

After a week of endless bubble baths, cuddling, and sex on every surface (Including against Mrs. Hudson's flat door when she was out one morning) John is both pleased and disappointed when a case finds its way to their doorstep.

The case itself is trivial, barely a five by Sherlock's own standards. But they're both going stir crazy, even if neither of them will admit it. John urges Sherlock out the door when Sherlock's microscope proves to be insufficient.

""Go to Bart's, use theirs. Molly won't mind."" John says, practically shoving Sherlock's arms in his coat as if dressing a child. ""I'm going to wash our bedding again then go for a walk and smell air that doesn't stink like nonstop sex.""

He kisses Sherlock on the lips, then pulls back his scarf long enough to swipe his tongue over Sherlock's bite. ""Go,"" he says softly, ""I'll be here when you get back. Tell Molly I said hello.""

Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second, then Sherlock is wrapping his arms around John so tight that for a solid ten seconds John isn't able to draw breath. ""Go,"" he croaks, pushing at his Alpha's chest.

Sherlock's laughter, rich and velvety, follow him down the stairs as he leaves. John watches the empty staircase for a moment, then busies himself with the washing up. When their room is once again presentable, he puts his own coat on and heads out to Regent's Park for a stroll.

He's barely gone one circuit around the perimeter of a park when a familiar scent makes him look to his left. There, with her nose in a book, is his older sister Harry. She's absentmindedly tossing bread at the ducks and doesn't even look up when he sits down on the blanket beside her.

""Not interested, whatever you're selling. I don't carry cash on me."" She says, turning a page.

""Then give me some bread,"" John says, reaching into an old shopping bag and pulling out a mangled piece of bread. Ripping it up he tosses it into the water. For the next minute, he ignores her gaze until she looks up at him.

Harry's head whips around to look at John. ""Jesus Christ!"" She yelps. ""What the fuck are you doing here? You haven't bloody called me since you got back. Thought you were dead in a ditch somewhere you little arsehole."" She punches his arm.

""You could have called. Phones work both ways."" John shrugs, pinching another piece of bread and feeding the small flock of ducks quacking up at him. He feels them begin to slip into the all too familiar blame game and sighs. Tossing the blast bit of bread to the ducks he shifts on the blanket and faces his sister. ""I could have called as well. But, I didn't."" Their only form of communication, if it can even be called that, has been when Harry commented on his blog and he replied. Best just to get it over with then,  ""I, well, I have some news. But you're not going to like it.""

Harry had been the Alpha who had been required to sign over his ownership when he'd joined the army. With their dad gone Harry had defaulted to making his legal choices. She hadn't been pleased with his choice, but their mum had convinced her to let John join. Still, John knew she felt a sense of ownership about him and had been angry when he hadn't asked her to take it back when he'd returned home.

""I... well, I bonded."" He tilts his neck to let his older sister see the mark. Still fresh, it was red, with a bit of bruising around the teeth marks, but it would be clear to anyone who looked at it that John had not struggled while receiving it. It was clean, with no torn flesh, just perfect incisions.

""WHAT. THE. FUCK!"" Harry growls, pulling John close to inspect his neck. ""And you didn't tell me! Jesus, John! I'm supposed to look out for you! And you just shack up with some random alpha! Knew I should have kept a closer eye on you. Can't leave you alone for five minutes. Wanting to join the bloody army and now this. Do you not have any self-preservation skills at all?"" She snaps, touching the bond. ""It's new. Really new. Where the hell is this alpha then? Letting you walk around alone freshly bonded? I'll bash their fucking head in."" She growls.

""Touch my mate, and I will bite your fucking fingers off,"" John snarls at his sister. The blinks, realizing just how true that statement was. Not because it was Harry, being a bitch and insisting she knew how to live his life better than he did. But because he would hurt anyone who hurt Sherlock. No questions asked, he would.

""I'm a grown fucking man, I can go where I want when I want."" Angry John pulls out of her touch and stands. ""But you're one of them, aren't you? Who prefers their Omega's trapped indoors perpetually pregnant until their body is so exhausted it kills them when they get pregnant one too many times? Is that what you want for me, Harry? Is your life only worth how many pups I produce?""

""That's not what I said, John."" Harry snaps. ""You bonded someone without even telling me! I'm your sister for Christ's sake! Didn't even invite me to the bonding ceremony. Trying to cut me out of your life totally? You've been trying to get away from our family since you were old enough to walk. And now you've and gone got yourself bonded to someone. What changed? You always hated the idea of being trapped with someone for the rest of your life. Did you go into heat and get in trouble? Begged anything with a knot to make it better?"" She snarls.

John's already on his feet and walking towards his flat. Taller than him by several inches, Harry catches up easily, even stopping long enough to shove her book and blanket into her handbag. Setting his jaw he hurries on, knowing that no one in their right mind would stop an Alpha from chasing after an Omega. And his bond bite, high above his collar, now told the world exactly what he was. Harry's heels click on the stone path as she shouts after him, demanding him to stop. He doesn't stop, he resists the itch between his shoulders, the urge to listen to the Alpha, his blood. Getting to the main road he flags down a cab and climbs in. Before he has a chance to shut the door, Harry sticks her hand in the door and snarls at John to push over. He has half a mind to slide to the other side and exit the car. But one look from the Alpha driver, and a deafening click, tells him the auto safety locks have been engaged. There is no escape for John.

""221 Baker Street,"" he hisses as he slides over and makes room for his sister. ""Mum would be disappointed in you,"" he says softly then instantly regrets throwing his mother's name at Harry like an insult.

Their mother had been kind. The type of woman who could make the best out of any situation. Who could make even the saddest people smile. In love with life and her family, she had taught John to fight against society's standards for Omegas. Telling him that there was so much more to life than simply existing in it. She'd passed only a year after their father, brokenhearted at his loss and unable to bear a world where he didn't exist.

""You don't have to tell me that. I feel it with every fiber of my being."" Harry mumbles, looking out the window. ""She was my mum, too. Just because you were an omega doesn't mean that she was any less of a mum to me. Even though she liked you better.""

""She didn't like me better."" John snaps, sick of this argument. ""She needed to teach me how to not be a pushover and, as you said, how not to beg anything with a knot to make it better""

The driver gets them to their destination in record time, clearly not wanting their combined anguish to stink up his car any longer than necessary. ""My Alpha sister offered to pay,"" John grumped, rolling the window down and opening his door from the outside.

He runs into Mrs. Hudson, who's just on her way out. She frowns at Harry, as she stomps up behind John.

""John?"" She asks questioningly, making John's heart melt. He knows, in that instant, that Mrs. Hudson would put her foot down and not let Harry step one foot into her property if John expressed that was his desire.

""My sister, Mrs. Hudson. Meet Harry. And, as you have no intention of leaving me alone, sis, why don't you come up. I can sense my Alpha getting closer. He'll love to have a chat with you.""

""Would you like me to stay, dear? I can put some tea on and we can all wait for Sherlock together."" Mrs. Hudson says softly, subtly standing between Harry and John. She was just as protective over John as she was Sherlock.

""No, Sherlock should be here shortly,"" John says, leaning in and kissing her on her cheek. ""Go enjoy bridge, and brag all about your bonded couple. Sherlock will be here soon, and Harry is more bark than she is bite. After all, she can't seem to find an Omega to bond.""

John casts his sister a withering glare, then pushes the door open. In mock politeness, he says, ""After you, Alpha. Up the stairs...""

""Well, you know where my special tea for guests is."" Mrs. Hudson pats his arm and heads out. Her special tea was actually an empty tin with a small revolver inside but no one outside of their house needed to know that.

Harry rolls her eyes and goes up the stairs. ""It stinks like alpha and sex in here."" She mocks a gag and opens a window. ""This place is a mess as well. Is that a skull?"" She gawks at the skull on the mantle.

""That's Billy,"" John says, moving to the kitchen to open the window by the sink. She wasn't wrong. The flat did need a good airing out. He'd have to talk to Sherlock about an air purification system.

""My mate is a scientist, so don't touch anything weird. Chairs are safe, as is the mantle. But... can't promise that the sofa isn't covered in come.""

John's mobile buzzes in his pocket, and he smiles a bit, knowing without looking that it would be from Sherlock. He ignored it, wanting to see Harry squawk at the full wrath of Sherlock Holmes walking in to find a strange Alpha in his house.

""Sit, I'll make tea,"" John calls over to his sister and counts down the minutes until Sherlock's footsteps come barreling up the stairs.

Sherlock frowns when John doesn't answer his text since John is usually prompt with that. He pays the cabbie and gets out, noticing the window upstairs was open. He opens the door downstairs. ""John?"" He calls up as he closes the door. He notices a smell and tries to place it. It was John's and someone else. Alpha

Sherlock growls and all but flies up the stairs and throws the door open, it slams so hard against the wall it bounces back and Sherlock grips it tight.

""Who are you?"" He growls deep and dangerous, a strange alpha in his territory, and by the sounds and smells coming from the kitchen, alone with his mate. ""Who?"" He snaps again, hating to repeat himself.

John stands back, between the kitchen and the living room, with his arms crossed over his chest and a grin plastered across his face. The look on his sister's face is priceless. She's paled so severely that she looks like Casper the ghost. Her fingers dig into the arms of Sherlock's chair (in which she unwisely sat, but John wasn't about to correct her) as she cowers under the Alpha.

She knew instantly that it was his home, and that any attempts to fight him meant he could do whatever he wanted to her. Her eyes find John's, and she stares desperately at her brother.

Rolling his eyes, John uncrosses his arms from his chest and walks to Sherlock. Placing a hand on his shoulder he says softly, ""Meet my sister. She sort of followed me here.""

Sherlock relaxes a bit as John touches him. He holds John close and scents him, not taking his eyes off Harry. ""You mean she stalked you like a creep.""

""Mmhmm."" John hums, happily letting Sherlock rub his face over his entire torso and neck. ""Said some pretty rude things to me as well. What did you say, Sis? Something about... Not being able to take care of myself, wanting any knot... and... Oh yes insinuated that I only bonded with you to make it better.""

John looks over at his sister and says in a deathly quiet voice, ""You're in my Mate's chair. I suggest you move. Oh, yeah, Harry, this is Sherlock Holmes, my soul mate.""

Harry scrambles out of the chair. ""Soulmate? You know those are just stories, John. Make it easier for omega's to swallow their place.""

Sherlock makes a sound of disbelief. ""Is she always like this?"" He asks John.

""Only when she's had an Omega turn her town."" John sighs, his face still buried against Sherlock's chest.

""She was my Alpha after dad died. I think she only let me join the military because mum asked her.""

Sherlock nuzzles John's hair. ""I'll drag her out if you want.""

""No, we should all talk."" John sighs and pulls away as Harry scrambles out of Sherlock's chair and stands a ways away, doing her best to look small and nonthreatening in another Alpha's domain.

""Sit, have my chair,"" John suggests, motioning Harry to the red armchair. A growl starts in Sherlock's throat but John hushes him with a kiss.

""I'll sit on your lap if it makes you feel better. But I'm perfectly fine dragging one of the wooden chairs over.

""I had been making tea,"" John says and leaves the two Alphas to size each other up. ""I'll go finish, no taking your cocks out and comparing them, please. I do not need to see my sister's cock.""

Sherlock glares at Harry but sits across from her, looking as big and dangerous as he can.

John comes back with the tea a few minutes later and shoves a mug into Harry's hands, sloshing some of the hot liquid over the brim and onto her lap.

""Oops."" He says flatly, then hands (more carefully) Sherlock his mug. He retreats into the kitchen for his mug, then pulls a spare chair up to Sherlock's chair and sits.

""Harry here was just saying how rude it was we didn't invite her to the bonding ceremony. I agree, rude of us not to even invite ourselves.""

Rolling his eyes John glares daggers at his sister then says, ""We didn't have one, Harry. We bonded, came home, and some bloke from the registry showed up, took the pictures, and left. We haven't even discussed a party or anything like that.""

Harry wipes her hand off on her trousers. ""So you're just doing everything backward. I'm surprised you're not knocked up.""

Sherlock snarls, John's hand the only thing keeping him in his seat.

""Backwards?"" John growls, his fingers digging into Sherlock's arm. ""How is bonding backward? We talked about it, for months, Harry. We had a plan, and knew we both wanted it when my heat came.""

John sets his mug down on the table and flexes his hand. ""Or are you just mad that we didn't ask your permission first? We didn't have to. I was still a ward of the military, they expected me to bond.""

""You were my responsibility! Mum made me promise!"" Harry snaps.

""No, Mum asked you to keep me safe. Not dictate my every fucking move in life."" John growls back. ""I don't need you, and I sure as hell don't need Sherlock. But that's the point,"" John says, tightening his grip on Sherlock's arm when he feels his mate tense. ""I want him, Harry. I'm not bonded with him because I require him. I bonded with him because I want him.""

John slumps back in his chair and heaves a sigh. Scrubbing his hand through his hair he blows a breath out between his lips.

""Before him, life was grey. I was injured, you were busy telling me how I'd be perfectly healthy if I had done things your way. Harry, for Christ's sake I wanted to eat a bullet.""

His sister stops fretting with her wet trousers and looks up sharply.

""It was bad, for a while there. Then this bloke needed a flatmate, and he showed me how to live again. Life had colour again. He didn't care who or what I was, he just wanted me for me.""

John sighs and explains how they'd met, and how they'd pretended to be in a relationship. His first heat when the military had messed up his suppressants. For the first time in his life, he's fully open with his sister. He ignores how weird it is to explain the sexual requirements of his body to his own blood, but does so anyway so his sister can understand. When he's done, he looks over at Sherlock and reaches out. Pulling down Sherlock's collar he shows his sister the matching mark his Alpha now wore.

""Dad had one too? Didn't he? Just... lower on his neck?""

Harry frowns and nods, looking schooled. ""He did. Showed it off and made mum blush..""

""Really?"" Sherlock looks at John.

""Yeah,"" John says around a sigh. ""I kept thinking about it after your brother left. Wondering why mum used to read those stories to me.""

Reaching for his tea he takes a sip then shrugs over at his sister.

""It's not a myth. Some of us are just lucky enough to avoid the system of forced bondings, and get to choose our mates.""

Harry rolls her eyes. ""Maybe some of us don't want a mate."" She grumbles.

Liar flashes over Sherlock's mind.

Sherlock's voice echoes throughout John's head. Liar it says. He cocks his head at Harry, inspecting her closely then nods once.

""Then don't get one, dummy."" John sighs, ""It's always a fight with you, isn't it. You couldn't just follow me here and meet Sherlock. Instead, you have to stir things up, then lie to us.""

John gets up and opens the second window before sitting on Sherlock's lap. It's a tight squeeze, two full-grown men, but they make it work with only a minimal amount of spilled tea.

""I'm done fighting with you, and when his family throws us a surprise bonding party, I'll make sure you're invited.""

Sherlock cuddles John close, one arm around his back and the other around his legs. He nuzzles John and kisses his neck.

Harry rolls her eyes and looks anywhere else.

Ignoring his sister, John turns to his mate and kisses his forehead.

""What made you leave Bart's so quickly? Did you solve the case? Was it the uncle?""

Sherlock hums. ""It was. I have to go back and finish the analysis. But I just.. I had a feeling that I needed to come home."" He shrugs.

""You can go,"" John says, kissing Sherlock a second time. ""Mrs. Hudson offered me the special tea, plus I'm not completely defenseless. Worst case, I can just punch my sister in the nose.""

""I'm not leaving you alone with her."" Sherlock shakes his head. His alpha couldn't leave his mate alone with another alpha in his territory even if it was his omega's sister.

""I'm right here you boobs,"" Harry says, reaching out her foot in an attempt to kick John's shins.

Sherlock stops the movement with his own foot and a look of pure ice.

""Harry, for fucks sake, why are you still fighting me? Us? We're happy, you don't have to worry about your baby brother anymore. You can focus on yourself, on what you want... maybe someday you'll be an aunt. Who knows, we're kind of leaving that question up in the air right now.""

Sighing, for what felt like the hundredth time that afternoon, John stares at his sister. ""Mum would have liked him, and she'd be happy to see me happy. This is what I want, no one forced anything on me. My only complaint is his brother. If you want to be a dick to someone, be a dick to Mycroft.""

Harry makes a face. ""I'm sorry."" She finally apologizes.

Surprise makes John go completely still. He stares at his sister for a long moment then nods once.

""Are you staying for dinner, Harry? Neither of us cooks much. But we do have the top twenty takeaways on speed dial.""

""If you want me to."" Harry nods but she looks to Sherlock for permission.

""If John invites you to dinner you don't need my permission."" Sherlock sighs. ""We're equaled and you are his sister. As long as he doesn't get any ideas of inviting my brother for dinner we're fine.""

""Sherlock, If I ever invite your brother to dinner, that's me signaling to you that I'm being held against my will.""

John laughs and stands up. Then holds his hand to his sister. ""Truce?"" he asks. She nods and shakes his hand.

""Mum would have been happy for you,"" She admits after a moment.

""Angelo's?"" John asks, after smiling at his sister. ""I could go for his lasagna.""

""Mm sounds good."" Sherlock nods and scents John once more before releasing him.

He follows John out and into a cab, making sure he's between John and Harry.

Dinner is quiet, but John's pleased that things aren't awkward or forced between himself and his sister. Sherlock, for his part, was happy to sit back and watch. Only once did he give Harry a warning glance.

Later, after they see Harry off, John closes the windows and turns to Sherlock. ""Heading back to Barts?"" he asks softly.

""I don't have to. Molly can send me the results."" Sherlock shrugs. He tosses a robe over John's chair to mask Harry's scent.

Oh, Harriot. I love your passion but calm your tits. Also, funny enough, both Accident and I picture Harriot to look like Alex Kingston.

John makes a choice...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Another week goes by, and soon John is faced with a hard choice. His mobile alerts him that he has three days to take a pregnancy test (to confirm he's not pregnant) and get on the new suppressants. When Sherlock finally drags himself out of bed, wrapped in nothing but a sheet, John greets him with a cup of coffee and sits him down at the table. He explains the choice he has to make and looks at Sherlock with a nervous smile.

""Do I go back on them? Or do I ask just for more contraceptives? Or... nothing at all?""

Sherlock sips his coffee, thinking. ""It's your choice. I just want to make that clear first thing."" He says softly. ""Are you ready for pups?"" He asks, setting his mug down.

""I..."" John scrubs a hand over his face and stares at the tabletop. ""Yes and no? Is anyone truly ready for a human to need them with such intensity?"" He chews his bottom lip then looks up at Sherlock. ""Are you?""

""I... I don't know."" Sherlock says softly. ""I want pups with you. I do. I just,"" He sighs. ""I don't think I'd be any good at it..""

""I'm scared too,"" John says after a long pause. He gets up and walks over to Sherlock. Standing beside his chair he leans down and presses his head against the top of Sherlock's head and sighs.

""We can try together? Bring life into this world for you to teach? I can do it, as long as I have you by my side.""

""Together."" Sherlock scoops John up and sets him in his lap, kissing him deeply.

John stops taking his contraceptive that very day. Normally, an Omega would be expected to make an appointment with their Gp to discuss the change in medication. They'd then be subjected to monthly (invasive) appointments to ensure all was working as intended. Luckily for John, he's a doctor and has an Alpha who doesn't care what John does, as long as he's healthy. They approach his next heat with nervous excitement. Mrs. Hudson visits her sister, and they spend three days in the throes of passion. Every day after his next heat, John asks Sherlock if he can smell a change. And every day he's met with a gentle, but sad shake of Sherlock's head. When enough time has passed that he can take a pregnancy test, he knows the answer, even before the test confirms it.

""Nothing,"" he says to Sherlock through the loo door, tossing the stick in the trash. ""Nothing..."" Sitting on the closed toilet lid as Sherlock comes in, he puts his head in his hands and fights back tears.

""I didn't realize how much I wanted this, Sherlock.""

""It's okay."" Sherlock holds John. ""It's okay. This is your first heat off suppressants and contraceptives. So it may take a little time to work out if your system. Besides, it's not unheard of for some couples to go through a few years until they get pregnant. We'll have pups. And until then we just keep doing what we're doing. In the meantime, we can practice new positions and things to help.""

He kisses John's head and rubs his back. ""It'll happen. Stressing about it will only make things harder.""

""I know..."" John says around a sniffle, burying his face into Sherlock's chest. ""You're right. Just another excuse to have sex, yeah?"" 

""I guess,"" John says later, after he's cried himself out, ""this means I want pups. Proof, that we're doing the right thing.""

Sherlock hands him a warm flannel which he gratefully accepts. He washes his face, then smiles. ""That's good, I guess. To find out now instead of finding out I am pregnant and having second thoughts.""

Sherlock smiles softly and nods. ""I think you're right."" He leans in and kisses him tenderly. ""I love you.""

""I love you, Sherlock,"" John says softly while leaning into the kiss. ""So much.""

Sherlock nuzzles him and scoops John up. ""I think we both need a cuddle. And you can drink.""

With the newly discovered void in his life, John begins to find ways to spend his time. One morning, after kissing Sherlock goodbye and telling him not to anger Anderson, John sits alone in the flat. Taking out his mobile he fiddles with the device before following through with his plan


'Any luck looking into bonds like Sherlock and I's? You could check my parent's records. I think they were perfectly matched.'


He hits send and sits back and waits. Unsure if asking Mycroft for help is the smartest choice. Mycroft didn't do things for free, and he wasn't sure what this would cost him in the long run


'Nothing. Just a few old folk tales but no academic work, no proven evidence, I can't even get into files that mention something about the alpha being bitten. The information isn't going to be readily available in the government since it's overrun with alphas who what it squashed and forgotten.-MH'


John fiddles with his phone for a few minutes then sighs. He knows where he can start but it means one of two things. Either he goes back home, roughly a five-hour drive, with Sherlock. Or without.

He has some family back in Lancashire, his mother's Omega sister and a beta brother of his dad's, along with cousins. He hasn't been home since his parent's deaths, having moved with Harry to London when she left for university.

He heads into the bedroom and packs a bag for both himself and Sherlock (just in case) then spends the day tracking down addresses, even going as far as to let Harry know his plans.

Leave a comment and let us know what you think! -Accident

I think this is why I love omegaverse so much. A half Holmes half Watson child would be unstopable. Certainly, even an adopted child raised by them would be as well, but there's something special about their biological child in my book. And this is coming from a woman who doesn't want/can't have kids LOL -Tindo

John takes Sherlock to the village where he grew up...

Enjoy!

Note from Tindo: I know nothing about the location in England I set at John's hometown. Please be kind to me in the upcoming chapters. If it helps, picture him in a fictional town.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Sherlock bounds up the stairs. ""John! John! Anderson slipped in a puddle of blood! I have pictures!"" He grins as he comes inside.

His grinning is soon replaced with a confused face and then a pained one. ""Are you leaving?"" His voice cracks, looking at the bags John had packed. ""What did I do? I can fix it. Whatever I did I can fix it, John. I promise. Just don't leave. You don't need to leave."" He says, feeling panicked and distressed.

Instantly John goes to Sherlock's side and soothes his hands up and down Sherlock's arms.

""Hush love, one of them is for you.""

He quickly explains the text from Mycroft and his fear that Mycroft won't be successful in helping them learn more about their bond.

""I was going to visit family in the morning and pick their brain about my parents. Thought you might like to come."" He finishes, motioning to one of the cases.

""Oh. Oh. Thank goodness."" Sherlock pulls John into his arms and scents John heavily.

""I couldn't ever leave you. Not willing at least."" John says softly. ""You're my other half. But I also wasn't going to force you into a cramped car for the better part of the day just to go sit and chat with my cranky relatives.""

""I know. I'm sorry. I just.. panicked."" Sherlock nuzzles him. ""Of course I want to go with you. They may tell me things about you from when you were younger. I won't miss that opportunity."" He grins.

""Git,"" John says fondly, looking over at the bags. ""It's only noon... we could be there by evening? No, I told them we'd be there tomorrow, already made reservations for a room.""

He stops, remembering what Sherlock had said about Anderson, and reaches for Sherlock's mobile.

""Show me?"" he giggles.

""Whenever you'd like."" Sherlock nods and brings up the pictures, laughing as he looks at them before handing his phone to John.

Anderson was lying face first in a pool of blood, a smear mark around the edge where he slipped. There's a few more pictures where he's trying to get up but ends up slipping onto his back. ""Those are priceless,"" John says, gasping for breath through his laughter.

The next morning the flat is a whirlwind of activity. With Sherlock forwarding case-solving information over to Lestrade, and John making sure they aren't forgetting anything. Sherlock pouts a bit, sad he won't be there to see the end of the case; a murderous wife who'd dismembered her husband for cheating., only slightly disappointed he won't be there to see the murderous wife arrested. They rent a car, rather than taking the train, and John slips behind the wheel with a grin. His new license is finally getting put to use.

""I should warn you,"" he says after they've been driving for a while. ""My aunt is one of those Omegas who's been cowed by her family into a shell of a life. Her Alpha is a decent man, treats her right if not a bit controlling... but Mum and her sister didn't have the best life as Omega kids...""

Sherlock frowns. ""Were they abused?"" He asks softly. He often wonders about John's parents, if they were like him and John. Soulmates. A perfect match. He wonders what it's like to be raised by parents who were a perfect match.

""Not sure,"" John gives a half shrug and shakes his head. ""Emotional abuse, perhaps? Mum didn't take us to see her parents often. She has an Alpha sister whom I've never met. I've just seen pictures of her and her family.""

""I've been wondering,"" he said softly, ""How mum and dad met, you know? I never thought much about dad's bite... it was, here,"" John points to the area when the shoulder meets the neck and shrugs again, ""Dad always wore a shirt, so we didn't see it often. Only if out swimming, whenever the weather decided to be warm enough for that. But, they loved each other, you know? It wasn't just a bond forced on my mum. She truly cared. When he got sick... Harry and I watched the life leave her eyes.""

""I'm sorry, John,"" Sherlock says softly, resting his hand on John's thigh. ""They only had you and Harry?""

""Mm."" John nods, ""We never found that odd as kids. It just was how it was. But I do remember my Aunt scolding mum for not having more. But she and dad were happy with us.""

""Large families never made sense to me. Anything over six feels overwhelming. And I hate how some people let their oldest kids raise the youngest while they keep breeding. It's horrible."" Sherlock sighs. ""My parents only had two as well but I think it was because I was such a hand full they didn't want to risk another like me."" He hums.

""Tell me about them? Your Mum and Dad? I want to know everything I can about you."" Sherlock prods.

""Mum's name was Joann, Dad's Harrison,"" John says, waiting for Sherlock to laugh at the originality of his and his sister's names.

Sherlock chuckles softly. ""Sherlock is a girl's name."" He smiles at John. ""I think that's nice. Named after your parents.""

""Sherlock is not a girl's name."" John laughs but then smiles at his mate.

""I got Mum's looks. Harry somehow came out an even split. She has dad's eyes and nose. Not sure where her attitude comes from. Neither of our parents were arseholes. Maybe it's just the Alpha in her?"" John sighs and slips into a shortened version of his life story. Telling Sherlock about the family trips, Christmas holidays spent bundled up by the fireplace, and everything he could remember about his parent's relationship. Ending with, ""they were more than the Alpha dad and Omega mother... They were home if that makes sense.""

Sherlock listens intently, taking in every bit of information John gives. He memorizes everything and files it away ""I think it does. I.. I'd like to be that four our pups."" He says softly.

Growing up for him wasn't exactly cold but it wasn't overly warm either. He wanted his pups to know they were loved and wanted. That their parents adored them.

""Me too, and I think they'll have that. I mean, we're choosing to have them. We want them. That must mean something, yeah?""

The ride is long, but the scenery beautiful. They stop a few times to let Sherlock stretch, and John let's Sherlock finish the last leg of the journey so he can watch once familiar landscape drift past them. Nearing the center of town he points to a small inn. ""I've made reservations there, if you want to stop so I can use the loo.""

""It does. We want them. We're choosing them. Our pups."" Sherlock nods and pulls into the inn. ""We can check in and put our bags away."" He finds a spot and parks the car, following John into the office.

""What can I do for you sir?"" A man behind the counter looks at Sherlock, ignoring John.

""My mate made a reservation."" Sherlock hums.

""What's the name?"" He turns to the computer.

""Watson,"" John says flatly, staring at the prick behind the counter. ""But you already knew that, didn't you Pete? Still mad I wouldn't let you fuck me behind the school?""

He feels Sherlock stiffen beside him. Silver Blue eyes fixate on Pete, and John sits back and waits for the explosion of information with a smug grin on his face.

""Pete, Alpha. You've tried unsuccessfully to gain the attention of three, no four Omegas. You've struck out each time, due to your erectile dysfunction, shameful, in an Alpha your age. You spend your time growing and cultivating marijuana plants on the family farm, selling the leaves illegally under the local coppers' nose. I think I'll have a chat with them after we've checked in. Would you be kind enough to introduce me, John?""

John covers his mouth with his hand and tries his best not to laugh. ""Yeah, of course.""

Sherlock snatched up the key when it's offered in a trembling hand. He gives one last glare before following John out. ""What an arsehole."" He grumbles as they go and get their bags.

He helps John carry their things inside after unlocking the door. ""I'm sorry you have to deal with people like him.""

""Oh yeah this town is full of charming people,"" John says, tossing his bag on the bed.

""Everyone here knows me as Harrison's Omega son. Aside from my aunt, not sure anyone knows or cares about the years I spent in the military. Hell, no one even knows I'm a bloody doctor.""

Sherlock frowns. ""I'll just shove it in their faces then.""

He starts to unpack when something occurs to him. ""The erectile dysfunction. I could see the signs like normal but I could.. smell it?"" He looks at John confused. ""Omega's can smell that?""

""Wait!"" John stops unpacking and turns to Sherlock with an incredulous look on his face. ""You can't? Normally?""

""Nope."" Sherlock pops the 'p' and shakes his head. ""I suppose it's a biological advantage for omega's. Picking a mate whose cock actually works.""

""Oh, that's not it at all. At least, not for me."" John says, sitting on the edge of the bed while watching his mate.

""Oftentimes Erectile Dysfunction comes from the person's subconscious. Men, who have grown up in overly religious families, being taught that masturbation or sex before bonding is wrong. Yet, being blokes with a working body, they give it a shot. Guilt creeps up on them, even if they don't realize it, making it hard to maintain a hardon.""

John scrunches his face up, remembering the acrid scent coming off Pete in waves. ""Us Omegas have learned to see it as A person with something to hide. and that usually is a good enough reason to make sure you're never alone with them.""

""Ohh."" Sherlock nods, finishing unpacking. ""You grew up religious? Or is this just a heavily religious town?"" He sits next to John.

""Small town, more... superstitious than religious. But, yeah, we went to church. Some of us more than others. My family just did the major holidays, or if mum and dad got into a spat and they felt guilty."" John clarifies while pressing his weight against Sherlock's shoulder.

Sherlock wraps his arm around John and holds him close, nuzzling his hair. ""Sometimes it surprises me how different we grew up.""

""Mmm, I was allowed free reign of pretty much this whole town, until I presented."" John sighs. Sherlock's scents help override the dull chemical scent used to deodorize the rooms between guests. The air purifier in the corner hums, which reminds him of something he'd been meaning to bring up.

""Sherlock, with my sister back in my life, and your brother never leaving yours, and clients. We should get an air purifier in the lounge. Something we can turn on when other people come over so it isn't overwhelming. Come winter, we won't be able to open the windows as often. Not without freezing ourselves out.""

Sherlock sighs and nods. ""You're right. Only for the common areas though. I want our room to smell like us."" He kisses John's head.

""Mm."" John agrees, then looks out the window and takes in the town he'd grown up in. ""Why don't we start with my mom's sister, Jennie? With any luck, they'll invite us to dinner and embarrass me by showing you pictures of me as a kid. I went through a stage where I refused to wear shirts for an entire summer. Mum gave up trying, and just made me wear dungarees.""

Sherlock grins. ""I want copies."" He chuckles and kisses John soundly.

Leave a comment and let us know what you think!

John takes Sherlock to meet his Aunt...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

When they were ready to go Sherlock followed John out, ignoring the odd looks they got from passers-by because he wasn't driving. ""They know we're coming, right?"" He asks, the people they pass watching. He hated small towns for that reason. ""Everyone seems to know we're here..""

""Yup... after we found out I wasn't pregnant I called my aunt. She said to come up any time, and when I suggested we visit now, she didn't object.""

John glowers at the people watching and contemplates backing up into Pete's truck. ""Still driving that piece of crap his grandfather left him...."" John rolls his eyes and grunts, ""We're in England, he doesn't even live on a farm, what's he need a damned truck for?""

""Compensating."" Sherlock snorts and smirks.

""That reminds me..."" John groans and leans his forehead against the steering wheel before exiting the car park.

""We'll be asked about pups, and how many we want? When we'll be having them..."" He groans again and hits his head against the wheel a few times.

""We can tell them it's none of their business. Or we're waiting. Or that you have a few loads of my cum plugged up inside you as we speak."" Sherlock rubs John's back. ""Or we don't have to say anything.""

""Sherlock,"" John says, turning to look at his mate. ""There's something you need to know before we get there. The last time I was here... My mum had just died. Harry had taken over sole ownership of me, and she was moving us to London so she could attend uni. My aunt offered to let me stay with her and her Alpha, and said she'd help me get a good Alpha so I could settle down and spread my roots.""

Sucking in a deep breath he closes his eyes, remembering with striking clarity how vicious he'd been at the time. ""I told everyone off, swore to them that I'd never bond. That I'd rather drive into the ocean than bond. I... didn't know I'd meet you then.""

""John, you're allowed to change your mind. And if anything you probably wouldn't have bonded with anyone. I just happened to be your soulmate as well as being charming and handsome and brilliant. Really you couldn't have turned me down if you tried."" Sherlock smiles softly, gently teasing.

""Charming?"" John says, turning his head to fix Sherlock with a single arched eyebrow. ""I think we have a different definition of the word charming, love."" He smiles over at his mate then rolls his eyes at Sherlock's smirk.

""Right... Off to Aunt Jennie's we go.""

John rubbernecks as they drive through the town, pointing out old shops, or empty buildings where shops used to be. They pass a park and he slows down and glances out his window with a grin. ""I used to play there every day. We only lived a few streets away, mum would let me walk or take my bicycle.""

""Causing all kinds of mayhem I'm sure."" Sherlock chuckles, imagining John as a small boy running around with a pack of friends.

""Who? Me?"" John pretends to be appalled at the accusation, ""I was an angel.""

Unable to keep a straight face he bursts out laughing. ""This one time, I'd gotten ahold of a bottle of vinegar. One of those giant gallon bottles restaurants get. My friend Winston and I made the biggest paper mache volcano we could manage, and about three boxes of baking soda. We mixed in a god-awful amount of orange food colouring with the vinegar. It was raining out, so we set the thing off on my mum's white carpet. I couldn't sit down for a week.""

Sherlock chuckles. ""At least you didn't break every window in your house twice during the course of one summer.""

""I don't think I want to know,"" John replies as he continues to drive.

After a minute or two, they pass a street and John frowns. ""That... that was my street. Not sure I can see the house. Not right now. My Aunt lives right up here anyways...""

A few minutes later they pull up in front of a small home. Large hedges line the borders, proving privacy from the close-quarter neighbors. Kids play out on the lawn and look up when the car pulls into the drive. One of them runs in, clearly to tell an adult that ""Someone is here"" and by the time John has the car in park, a round woman steps out, three small children no older than five trails behind her.

""Good God, they can't be hers... I have cousins only a few years younger than me."" John whispers as he pushes the door open and steps out.

Sherlock follows John, observing the gaggle of children and the woman.

""Hi, Aunty,"" John calls out to the woman. It takes her a moment to recognize him as a grown man, but she recovers quickly and steps forward to pull him into her arms.

""Where's Harry?"" She says, looking at the car, then at the man standing beside it. ""You said you'd bring her?""

""No,"" John says carefully, ""I said I would bring my Alpha. Aunty, meet my mate Sherlock.""

Jennie's eyes dart to John's neck, then John can smell the happiness on the woman as she puts two and two together. She releases John and goes to Sherlock. John half expects her to pull him into a bearhug, but instead, she simply thrusts out a hand for Sherlock to shake.

""A pleasure to meet you, Ma'am."" Sherlock shakes her hand, firm but gentle, and bows his head, an obvious sign of respect which is rare for an alpha to give an omega.

""Oh you got bagged by a polite one,"" Jennie says with a chuckle.

John catches Sherlock's eyes and with a shake of his head warns Sherlock not to argue or correct her.

""He's great,"" he says simply, then looks around at the kids playing. ""These aren't all yours, are they?""

""Oh goodness no!"" She laughs, rubbing the head of a toddler as he runs past. ""I run a sort of daycare, for those poor Omegas who have to work.""

""It's nice that they have someplace to be looked after."" Sherlock hums, following John and his Aunt inside the fenced-in yard.

""That it is,"" she agrees as she bustles to the door, ""Why don't you come in, you too John.""

""Yeah, I was sort of planning on it,"" John says with a roll of his eyes. ""Ta..""

Sherlock has to dodge a few children running around, nearly stepping on a few under his long legs. He walks through the yard like it's a minefield and finally makes it inside after John.

The house smells like nappy cream and something fruity. It instantly sets John back twenty some odd years to when he used to visit with his mother just after his aunt had given birth to her third.

""Still the same,"" he smiles, looking at the pictures on the wall as they walk through the hall towards the kitchen in the back. ""Frank looks great,"" he commented as he passed a recent family portrait.

""Uncle Frank, John."" She scolds but John just sticks a hand out, his fingers and thumb straight, and flaps them about, mouthing ""Blah Blah Blah"" to Sherlock.

Sherlock chuckles softly, looking at the pictures and taking in the house. It was obvious by John's aunt's hips that she had quite a few children herself and she still surrounds herself with pups.

""You run this daycare all by yourself?"" Sherlock asks, noting that most of the children seemed well behaved and were entertaining themselves.

""I do."" She says proudly, motioning John and Sherlock to sit at the table. ""Children born from an Omega are usually quite docile. Don't know where your mum went wrong with you two,"" she says, casting a look over to John who suddenly felt like a child being scolded for pinching a pastry before dinner.

""She didn't go wrong, she let us have fun.""

Sherlock rests his hand in John's thigh to comfort him. ""I'm sure John was a model child compared to me.""

""All the windows? Twice?"" He asks, turning to Sherlock with a laugh. ""Good god, Sherlock. You were a right terror, weren't you? I mean, you still are, so I guess that shouldn't surprise me.""

""John Watson"" his aunt shot out in a stern tone, ""We do not talk to our Alpha's like that."" Turning to Sherlock she dips her head in apology, ""Sorry if I offended you. I don't know your last name, but I assume John took it when you bonded.""

""Actually we hyphenated. Holmes-Watson. I insisted."" Sherlock nods, letting the weight of his words settle.

""Watson-Holmes still sounds better,"" John mutters playfully, nudging Sherlock's foot under the table. ""Aunty, he doesn't make me live in his shadow, so stop scolding me like I'm a child. If he takes offense by anything anyone does, he'll be the first to say so. Trust me on that one.""

John toys with a baby spoon on the table then he turns to his aunt. ""We're sort of here for answers, actually. Remember how Dad had that bite on his neck? Well, when Sherlock and I bonded it just felt right to give him one. It's given us this weird... joint bond. We're in each other's heads. Hell, he smelled Pete's problem when we checked into the inn because of our bond. Is there anything you can tell me about my parents' bond?""

John watches carefully as his aunt turns her back to them and begins making tea. He looks at Sherlock out of the corner of his eyes and notices him watching her with slanted eyes.

""You know what it means but you're trying to think of a lie that's convincing. We're all adults here. Bonded adults. We don't need to be treated like children. We've shown you nothing but respect and we'd like the same in return. Tell us what you know. It's much easier than having to deduce it."" Sherlock says, starting to get annoyed with her behavior.

""My sister was so proud of herself when she announced she and Hank had bonded,"" she says, setting the kettle down on the stove with a bit too much force. ""Came home to back her bags, bright red bite on her neck. We hadn't heard from her in four days. Our parents had gone to the police and everything. Thought someone snatched her just before her heat.""

Jennie sighs and picks at a frayed corner of a tea towel before turning to face the two men sitting at her table.

""She knew her heat was coming and knew our parents were in the beginning stages of an agreement with an Alpha who wanted my sister. So she ran off with Him and they spent half a week in a tent by the ocean fucking. She got pregnant with Harry because of that little stunt, preventing the other Alpha from laying his claim on her because he didn't want to raise some other Alpha's whelp.""

John shifts uncomfortably as he listens to his aunt. Her words were strained, and her wording made him think there was no small amount of anger being held back.

""She told me about her bonding, as she packed. Eyes bright with the wonder of her new life. Told me how she'd bitten him, and how they now shared one soul.""

Twitching her nose she stops short and glares at her nephew. ""But that's all I'll say. We've been warned not to talk about it, and I suggest you don't go about town asking about your dad's bond bite. You'll find people won't be as friendly with you if you do.""

""So you pumped out half a dozen pups trying to feel the same happiness your sister had gotten seemingly so easy and failed?"" Sherlock asks, waves of irritation coming off him. ""Instead of being bitter and jealous, you should have been happy for her. For her happiness. That she found the one person who could complete her. This."" He opens his collar and shows his bite. ""This is world-changing. Breathtaking. And I pity you for never being able to experience it but that doesn't mean you get to be horrible to John for something that happened before he was born.""

The air crackles around John as he watches his aunt, a person who believed her kinship provided her household with some small sliver of authority over John's life and his mate. He could feel Sherlock's anger and was in no position himself to send calming signals across the bond. All he could do was hope and pray his uncle wouldn't show up while everyone's hackles were still raised.

After a few minutes of the staredown, John clears his throat and nods at the kettle. The whistle had been taken out of the device, no doubt removed by his aunt after an untimely cup of tea had awakened one of the many children now taking up space, albeit temporary, in her house.

""Mum was happy,"" John says softly, ""Dad was happy too, and he provided the best life for all of us.""

""Until he went and killed himself."" Jennie spits

""He got sick,"" John growls, ""a heart attack isn't killing oneself.""

""I think that's quite enough for today."" Sherlock stands, rising to his full height.

John agrees and shows it by storming out of the house. Though his dramatic exit is slightly dampened by having to step over toys and children. Making it to the car first he pulls open the passenger's door and collapses inside. When Sherlock sits in the driver's seat he hands the keys over and closes his eyes.

""She's a bitch."" John hisses, gripping his bad leg and willing the phantom stab of pain to go away. ""Why didn't I see it before? Not allowed to play with my own cousins, despite living within walking. distance?""

""It's not your fault she's bitter and jealous. She saw my bite the minute she shook my hand. It set her off from the start."" Sherlock starts the car and makes sure there were no children around before pulling out of the drive.

He rests his hand on John's thigh and rubs it gently. ""I'm sorry it didn't go well. I know you were hoping for information about your parents. I.."" He thinks. ""What happened to all the things in your parent's house? Are they still there?""

John chews his lip for a moment then gives Sherlock a noncommittal grunt.

""Harry took care of that... I was a bit too upended by the whole thing to care. I'll ask her.""

Pulling his mobile out he shoots his sister a text then points to a road. ""Go left, I want to go scream into the surf.""

At first I wanted to like John's aunt. But by the end of this chapter we realized nope, she's a bitch.

The boys go to John's parent's house...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Harry texts John back that she sold the non sentimental things and most of the furniture. Everything else was still locked up in the house since they didn't have anywhere to put it when she was in uni. 

Sherlock nods and follows John's directions. Soon he parks in a lot by the sand and follows John out over the dunes.

Kicking his shoes and socks off John leaves them at the edge of the beach and walks down to where the dry sand met wet. He sits and puts his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands.

""I don't love being back here. I hate the looks, I hate her. I hate that I can't just go knock on the door and see my parents.""

""I'm sorry, John."" Sherlock sits next to him in the sand.

""It's fine."" John says softly, watching the water. The beach wasn't pretty by most people's standards. It was more rock and dangerous channels than it was lapping waves. Heck, there was a sign warning people of quicksand not far down the road. But this had been John's home for half his life. 

""I used to come down here and snog."" John said, turning to Sherlock with a shy smile on his face, ""Sherlock Holmes would you like to have a snog in the sand?""

""John, do you even have to ask?"" Sherlock smiles softly and pulls John close.

""No, I don't. I could just rip your clothes off and have you now, but the tied comes in fast... So maybe save that for later?""

Smirking John gets up off the sand and sits across Sherlock's lap, his arse on Sherlock's thighs and feet in the rocky sand behind Sherlock's back. Wrapping his arms around Sherlock's neck he leans in and presses his lips against his mate's cheek, then chin, then their lips find each other.

Sherlock holds John close, running his hands over his omega's back. He kisses John deeply, teasingly sliding his tongue along John's as the waves wash up and down the sand. 

He nips at John's lips and rocks against him teasingly.

John begins to relax under Sherlock's gentle care. His mate washes away the anger, replacing it with untainted love.

After what felt like ages, his lips sore, and Sherlock's legs certainly asleep, he got up and offered Sherlock a hand up.

""Let's go see my house. If Harry didn't move the spare key, I can get us in.""

""I can always pick the lock."" Sherlock takes John's hand and leads him back to the car, making sure they get their shoes. 

He follows John's directions and drives them to the house.

They sit in the driveway for a long moment before John opens the door steps out barefoot. The house is abandoned, but not  falling apart. Someone had been looking after it, and something told him it wasn't his aunt. 

""Harry must be paying someone to keep an eye on it."" John mused, thinking that perhaps it wouldn't hurt for him to offer to chip in once in a while.

""This way,"" he says, walking through a gate to the back garden. 

His feet carry him over familiar ground without thought. He goes to the back corner of the garden, the furthest point of the house, and lifts up a garden gnome. There, sitting in a waterproof case, is a silver key. Grinning he scoops it up and wiggles his toes in the grass. After a moment of that, he heads to the back door and slips the key into the lock.

The door opens easily, and they enter into a small room. ""Mud room, we used to call it. Because well, I might have covered every inch of that wall in mud when I was five."" John said, pointing to the wall facing the garden. 

""Kitchen is through here. What do you think we should look for?""

Sherlock hums as he looks around. ""Look for albums and pictures first. If we're lucky maybe one of your parents kept a journal.""

""Right."" 

The kitchen still smelled like home to John. Hints of his mother's favourite tea and her perfume still lingered, though it was nearly so faint he couldn't pick it out. 

Running his hands along the old table, he looked around the room and smiled sadly at a picture hung on the wall. It was the four of them, as a family. Harry looked to be about nine, while John was only six. He remembered that day, being forced to wear a suit with one of those clips on ties. His mother smiled down at him, while his father smiled over at his wife. 

""He never looked at the camera."" John said, nodding to the picture. ""Only had eyes for mum.""

Sherlock wraps his arm around John's waist as he looks at the picture, holding John close. ""I wish I could have met them..""

""Me too,"" John says softly, then tugs Sherlock through a door into the living room. He tests a light and hums in surprise when the bulb sputters on, then notices that the furniture is free of dust. 

He looks down at his fingers then frowns.

""I ran my hand over the table. No dust,"" he says, holding his fingers up. ""There isn't a speck of dust anywhere. Why is this place so bloody clean? And the powers on?""

Sherlock frowns. ""Someone's been here. Recently."" He sniffs but can't smell anyone else in the house now. ""Harry wouldn't have hired a cleaning company, she can barely keep her own affairs in order let one this place. Maybe your aunt since she knew we were coming?""

""No,"" John shakes his head and frowns, ""you saw the way she talked about my parents. She wouldn't dare step into their home."" 

John focuses on the room, for a moment worried that he'd just broken into someone's home, thinking someone else now lived here. But the pictures on the wall were still of his family, and his mother's blanket was still draped over the sofa. He brings the blanket up to his nose and sniffs. 

""This has been laundered. Recently. Sherlock, there isn't that musty scent that comes with abandoned houses. As far as I'm aware, Harry hasn't been up here in at least two years. Possibly longer. There aren't any cobwebs, or signs of mice... What the fuck is going on?""

Sherlock frowns and strands in the center of the room, slowly turning and taking everything in. ""The house has been searched already."" He says finally. 

""Some of the pictures were just the slightest bit off center. That chair has been moved from the opposite corner of the room.."" He lists subtle changes. ""Fucking Mycroft."" He hisses. ""He must have sent someone to look through the house.""

""Ohh..."" John sighs, but relaxes. The thought of someone playing house in his family home had upset him more than he was willing to admit. As much as he didn't love Sherlock's brother, he was relieved to think that it had been him, or his underlings, who had cleaned up.

""Almost nice of him, leaving the power on. Like he knew we'd come.""

""Nosy prick."" Sherlock sighs. ""Either they didn't find anything or they did and he's keeping it to himself."" He frowns. 

""John, if you wanted to hide something that you didn't want found where would you put it?""

""My mum never let us under her bed."" John said after a moment's thought. ""Harry and I used to play hide and seek, but we weren't allowed to hide under their bed."" 

""Bedroom?"" Sherlock asks, already heading towards the stairs.

""Up the stairs, first door on the left.""

John watches Sherlock bound up the stairs. But he stays in the lounge, turning in a small circle and looking around the room.

""I want my kids to have this. A home, a place to be happy."" he said softly, then sits down on the sofa and holds his mother's blanket close to his face.

Sherlock searches John's parents room, he looks at the pictures on the walls and what sort of people John's parents were. He inspects the floor where John's parents bed where, crawling on his hands and knees. 

He feels the floorboards, testing for any loose ones, and knocks on them to see if there's a hollow sound. He gets to a panel that would have been on John's father's side of the bed and it wiggles just slightly. 

It takes Sherlock a minute to get it up but the panel comes loose and he pulls out his phone. When he turns on the light he sees a stash of papers. ""John!"" He calls out.

Sherlock's voice pulls John from his reverie. Placing his mother's blanket back on the sofa he hurries up the stairs, ignoring the echoes of laughter and his mother singing. He finds Sherlock on his knees beside the bed. His back is to the door, so it isn't until John steps into the room and walks to Sherlock that he sees the papers.

""What is that? Oh god, if you tell me they're love letters I will throw up.""

""Well some of them are. And there's some photos that you probably shouldn't see."" Sherlock chuckles softly. ""But look. He, your father. He was digging as well."" He hands John some papers as he reaches deeper into the floor.

""Digging?"" John asks, then his jaw drops open when Sherlock hands him a stack. 

Written in his father's hand were the words ""Soulmate?"" and ""How it should be.""

Posting from my phone so I didn't do a quick once over for typos. Sorry!!

Boom...

Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""He knew... I mean, yeah he knew. We can feel it. But he was searching for more like us?"" John asks, leafing through the papers and reading snippets of his dad's research. ""What else is in there, except... god, sex pictures? Gross.""

""They're quite tasteful."" Sherlock hums as he looks at the pictures.

""Oi!"" John yelps, shoving a palm against Sherlock's shoulder. ""Stop looking at my mum while humming."" He laughs, and tries to yank the picture free without looking at it, but ends up getting an eyeful anyway.

""Gross, put that back. I don't need to know that my mum had sex.""

""I won't tell you that you have her arse then."" Sherlock chuckles and puts the pictures away, looking through the letters.

""Fuck off,"" John says fondly, shoving Sherlock a bit with his hip.

""Christ, they took those while me and Harry were just down the hall."" He pinches the bridge of his nose then sighs, accepting the fact that his parents were as madly in love as he and Sherlock were. ""I guess, I can't blame them. When you're looking up at me while I'm on top... I want to freeze the moment and remember the expression you get. It's half dorky, half wonder. I love it.""

""We can talk pictures if you want. Video even. Up to you."" Sherlock smirks. ""Just goes to show it's possible to have an active adventurous sex life while being parents."" He smiles.

""Alright right, enough about my parent's sex life thank you. What else is in my dad's hole."" John groans and slaps his hand over his face, instantly regretting his choice of words. ""The hole in the floor... I mean.""

Sherlock bursts into loud roaring laughter, curled up on the floor and holding his stomach from laughing so hard. ""His.."" He laughs. ""Hole!""

John hip checks his mate but ends up joining Sherlock on the floor laughing. He sits with his back against his parent's bed and laughs until tears come to his eyes.

""I guess I haven't magically inherited your eloquent way of words. Left that part out of the bond sharing experience, did you?""

Sherlock giggles and kisses John happily. ""You're perfect."" He kisses him again.

""Snogging in my parent's room feels a bit dirty."" John says, shifting closer. ""But, seeing how they have a secret cubby full of softcore porn, and secret research... I think they'd approve.""

""I should hope so. They'd probably be proud we found each other. Found our own soulmates. It just goes to prove everything they were trying to do."" Sherlock hums.

""Would snogging in your old room be more or less dirty?"" He nuzzles him.

""Oh yes, on my single-person bed, built for a kid, not a grown man. Brilliant idea."" John laughs then pulls away and glares at him. ""Wait, you just want to go see my room. Don't you?""

""Maybe but I also want to kiss you, so."" Sherlock shrugs. ""Besides I know kissing in here turns you on."" He smirks. ""It feels dirty and like we could get caught.""

""Feels like at any moment someone's going to walk in and catch me with my hands down my pants."" John says around a slow kiss. ""Come on, come see my room. I'm curious to see what Harry left, and what she boxed up.""

Standing John leads the way down the hall and pauses at the door. ""I took a lot of it with me when we moved, it's probably just old posters, maybe some action figures..."" he shrugs and pushes the door open.

The room instantly smells like home to him. His tiny bed is pushed against one wall, beside it is a desk where he used to do his homework. Star Wars posters line the walls and there's a partially empty bookcase sitting beside the door. John turns the light on and steps inside, letting Sherlock follow him in.

""Pretty bare..."" he says softly, though in his eyes he can see the room how it used to be. ""Figured out how to have my first wank in that bed, so I guess that's something.""

""Care to reenact it for me?"" Sherlock teases as he looks around.

""Why, have you taken up a sudden interest in the sturdiness of bed frames made in the 70's?"" John asks with a smirk while moving to sit on his old bed.

""Because I could show you if you'd like. Or you can get their hands-on experience.""

""Mmm yes please."" Sherlock grins and kneels in front of John.

It never ceases to amaze John just how fast the two of them can go from fully clothed to stark naked. In less than thirty seconds his and Sherlock's clothing lay piled on the floor and John stretched out against his old bed. His feet hang off the edge, making him giggle at the absurdity. Sherlock watches, eyes bright and hungry, as John reaches down and begins to stroke his cock.

""Watch me, Sherlock."" he says softly as he begins to toy with his own cock.

It's nothing like the fast desperate wanks he used to have in this bed. He knows what he likes by now. Knows how to swipe his fingers over the glans, and apply pressure at the base. It isn't just yanking and hoping for the best. Sherlock's eyes are pools of silver above him. He reaches out and slides his hand over Sherlock's stomach then lets out a surprised sigh as a trickle of slick makes its way out of him.

""Fuck me,"" he says firmly, lifting his legs and wrapping them around Sherlock's hips. ""I need you inside me. Please?""

""Needy omega."" Sherlock chuckles and it would sound more convincing if his cock wasn't leaking already. He holds John's hips and sinks his cock into John, groaning. ""Slick. So slick for me.""

John groans and pushes against Sherlock. He'd expected Sherlock to be met with some resistance. Between heats like this, it shouldn't be possible to have effortless sex with an Alpha's cock. And there certainly should not be any slick. But his body is pleasantly receptive, and instead of questioning it he pushes in and lets Sherlock sink deep inside him.

""Always need you, Sherlock,"" he says ""Always.""

Sherlock kisses John deeply, holding him close and rocking his hips, pressing deep into his omegas. He knew logically that it shouldn't be this easy to fuck John outside of a heat but his alpha side is enjoying being inside his omega.

""I'm here. All yours. Always."" Sherlock kisses and sucks on his bond mark.

The bed is too small for both of them, and the frame creaks ominously beneath them. But that doesn't slow either of them down. John coaxes his Alpha along, hands clawing at any part of Sherlock he can reach.

""Teeth..."" John hisses, presenting his neck to his Alpha. ""please, Sherlock.""

Sherlock gives into his omega's wants, giving John his bite as his thrusts rub his omega's prostate. John's climax crashes around him too fast. He feels like he's barely gotten Sherlock where he wants him when it happens. Too soon, but somehow perfect at the same time. Hot and heavy with a promise of more later. With a cry he raises his hips and pushes hard against Sherlock, missing the knot but full and happy. His muscles clamp down around Sherlock's cock as he lets out a cry of pleasure so loud it echoes off the walls. Come pools on his stomach and he begins to shake, begging Sherlock through his tremors.

""Come in me please. Fill me up. Only you, Sherlock.""

Sherlock thrusts a handful more times and comes hard into John, filling him with cum.

They sprawl on the bed as best they can, and John tries his hardest not to make a mess on his old blankets. After a while, when a mess becomes inevitable, Sherlock goes off in search of something for John to clean up with. He comes back with a bog roll and tosses it apologetically to John. After cleaning up John sits up and cocks his, tilting his neck side to side. Touching his bite he frowns and says, ""doesn't feel any different. Can you see it? Are there new teeth marks?""

Sherlock shakes his head. ""It's already disappearing.""

""Everything we do goes against everything I was programed to expect."" John says softly.""I didn't just want you to bite me. I needed it. We should go read what my dad wrote. I wonder if he and mum noticed this... This bite thing."" He says for lack of a better way to explain it.

Sherlock nods and helps John clean up before getting them dressed again. He follows John back to the room, giving John his father's notes to go through, and then goes through his parent's letters to see if there's anything in there. John curls up on his parent's bed and goes through the notes. Unorganized, as was his dad's habit, it's hard to decipher at first. But he spreads the pages out on the bed and begins putting them into some form of order. He finds two pages full of the same questions John has. Questions about the limit of their bond, why their children seem happier than others, about the instinct to bite and be bitten during sex. It goes on and on leaving John wide eyed. Only some of the questions have answers. He finds them on pages with numbers circled in the corner. The number corresponds to the number question it's answering. He finds a page with his and Harry's names written all over it and settles in to read. He reads silently at first. Then out loud as he reads his dad's theory.

""We often wondered why Harry and John never displayed the docile behavior most toddlers born from an Omega have. From the start Harriot was a spitfire, full of life and lungs ready to tell you just how bored she was.


John on the other hand used his lungs for a purpose. He was curious to the point of driving his mother and I mental. Everything was 'why' or 'what's that'. Our children were the talk of the town, and we considered strange parents.


We even thought ourselves strange until we found another couple with a few children all displaying the same 'loving life' behaviours. It was summer time, and we were at the Ocean. I saw their joint bites and introduced myself.""

""Sherlock... were you listening?"" John asks, flipping the page over to see if there was more. Not finding anything he brings flipping through the other pages to see if his dad had continued the story on another page.

""Hmm?"" Sherlock asks, reading through the letters. They were more personal, about feelings and desires. Life plans. How John's parents decided to run away together for John's mother's heat so they could bond and be together.

""Dad found another couple like them. He thinks there might be some link to the whole soulmate thing and children's behaviours... Not sure. It's mostly his thoughts written down so it's hard to decipher. ""

He sits up a bit and scrubs his hand over his face.

""But remember what my aunt said? Omega's children are docile? I guess Harry and I weren't. Sounds like we were anything but."" He holds the paper out to Sherlock and begins skimming over another one.

""Maybe we can track down the other couple somehow? Are there names or descriptions?"" Sherlock reads.

""From the letters, your dad knew right away that your mum was the one. He says it over and over. She was scared at first. Of what she felt for him. Afraid to admit it because of her family. She was actually the one that suggested they run away a bond."" He hums.

""Why the children? What would soulmate parents have bolder and louder children?"" He frowns as he reads through the papers.

""Maybe because they aren't born into a world of submission?"" John theorizes, glancing up from the papers to his mate. ""Children learn from their parents actions as much as they do from spoken word. And good God, are you saying our children will be bolder and louder than you""

""I'm pretty hard to beat."" Sherlock chuckles. ""I think you're right. Children learn mostly from their omega's in formative years. If the omega is made to be docile and quiet the children will also emulate that. Especially if the alpha is overpowering.""

John hums and nods as he pours over the stack of papers. Afternoon turns to evening and John's stomach begins to growl. He doesn't want to take his eyes off of his dad's work, but he looks up at Sherlock.

""Small town, everything closes early. If we want a chance at dinner we should think about leaving soon. Plus I'd love to walk into the Inn smelling of sex and see the look on Pete's face.""

""We can take the papers with us."" Sherlock nods, his own stomach feeling hungry because of their connection.

""Come on,"" John stands from his parent's bed and carefully picks up the papers from the bed. ""There's a place on our way back. We can get dinner, and I can get a beer.""

Sherlock nods and finds a briefcase in the closet for the papers to go in.

Placing the papers in the briefcase John looks around the room and sighs.

""I'm glad we came here. It's nice to smell home again.""

""We can come back whenever you'd like."" Sherlock rubs John's arm.

John locks up the house and pockets the key, intending to return it to it's hiding spot under the gnome before returning back to London. But for now he considered it his. His responsibility to ensure that his family home remains as secure as possible. He directs Sherlock back to the center of town, replacing his shoes and socks as they drive, then has him pull into a restaurant. He takes the briefcase in with him, somehow unwilling to part with the papers. They get a table in the back and John orders a beer, then places the briefcase on the chair beside him and pops it open. Pulling out the list of questions John begins digging through the other papers. His beer arrives before his food, and before he knows it it's gone and being replaced by another. Sherlock watches the people in the restaurant, dishing out glares and cold stares to those who do the same to them. He decides not to drink, not feeling comfortable enough to let his guard down. He looks at John, watching him go through the papers. He can't put his finger on it but something about this whole thing doesn't feel right.

""Listen to this,"" John says, pointing to a bit of underlined text.


""We learned early on that biting increases fertility if contraceptives are not being used (a fact other couples in our situation all agree upon) and re administering the bond bite during sex does the Omega (Joann) no harm. In fact, it always seems like my teeth find the same spot, over and over again.""


""So, he's saying you biting me, like you did earlier, didn't tear new flesh. Just... kind of... sunk home?"" John looks up at his mate, then takes a swig of his beer, passing the paper over to Sherlock who only half squinted at it.

""Relax, love. The worst that's going to happen is you'll get yelled at for letting me talk so much.""

""Arseholes."" Sherlock mumbles.

He reads the papers and something occurs to him. ""Gland expression?"" He looks at John. ""Biting the same spot of the bond can release hormones from the scent gland in the neck.""

Lifting a hand to the right side of his neck, John fingers his bond mark, then lets out a low whistle.

""Interesting. If that's the case, why didn't I learn about this in medical school?""

""What other properties does it have? Healing? Both physical and emotional? ""The medical field ignores omega's outside of their breeding capabilities."" 

""I suppose it could,"" Sherlock says with a  sigh. We can have a full blood panel worked up on both of us when we get back and compare it before we bonded."" He hums. ""In a letter.. hold on."" He looks through the papers.

""There's a letter your mum wrote. Talking about how she had this really bad flu. And your dad bit her instinctually. Without sex. And she was better within a day."" He hands John the letter.

""So... it's like this magical power that breaks the rules of the universe."" John says, shaking his head and swallowing the last of his second beer.

""People are dying, right now... mates... if only they knew. If only they'd bonded correctly.""

Sherlock frowns and nods. ""I don't know if there's a way to find a mate that doesn't happen by accident.""

""Yeah..."" John sighs, then is forced to move some of the papers when their food is brought out. He orders one more beer, then tucks in.

They continue to read over dinner, John's words becoming more slurred as he progresses through his third beer. They're just being asked if they wanted dessert when a loud explosion from the carpark makes John and Sherlock whip their heads up in surprise. Sherlock pulls out his wallet while John gathers the papers and stuffs them back into the briefcase. Handing over enough money to cover the cheque, Sherlock is up first and is already walking towards the exit when car alarms start to go off. John catches up, stumbling a bit, but keeping one hand firmly on the briefcase. Eyes wide with fear, he looks over at his mate as Sherlock pushes his way out of the emergency exit.

""Sherlock..."" He says softly, as they exit and see their rental car in flames. ""That's... our car.""

""We have to go. Now."" Sherlock grabs John's hand and takes off, needing to get them out of there as fast as possible. He gets them back to the inn and locks the door. He frowns, the room smelling freshly sanitized. ""What the fuck."" He starts to look around and their things have been gone through. He pulls out his phone and calls Mycroft. As soon as the call connects he starts talking.

""Someone just blew up our car. I've had a feeling we've been followed all day. Our room at the inn has been searched."" He growls.

""Wait, what?"" John mutters, looking around at the room. It takes him a lot longer to notice the subtle changes. The hard plastic travel case, which holds John's gun, has been moved from where John had handcuffed it to the bed frame. It was still secure, but John was certain he'd placed the case on it's side. Now it stood on end. He'd never gotten around to unpacking his suitcase, and being ex military, his packing skills were precise. Everything had it's natural place in John's case. Pants and socks in the top corner, then trousers. In the gaps, holding everything tight, would be t shirts. Then on top of those were his shirts he didn't want wrinkled. His pants had been pulled out and replaced below the trousers. After a quick count he growled.

""Pete... he took a pair of my bloody pants.""

Sherlock growls. ""I'll rip his throat out.""

""We need backup."" He growls at Mycroft, angry he's asking for help from Mycroft but he needed to keep his omega safe.

While Sherlock and his brother bicker (more like Sherlock bickering to a brick wall, John senses) John collects his gun and tucks it against the small of his back, covering it with his shirt. Out of habit, he goes to the window and peels back the curtain a smidgen and looks out. Nothing seems out of place, but the hairs on the back of his neck prickle.

""Someone's watching us. I can't see who, but I know they're out there. We nee..."" He stops short and walks to Sherlock, placing a hand over his mouth to silence him. ""Bugs?"" John mouths, looking around the room as if the very walls were listening in.

He pulls out the notebook he carries with him. Flipping to a blank page he writes


Car, text Mycroft... my house?""


Sherlock nods and hangs up the phone. He texts Mycroft to send a car immediately.

It takes less than five minutes for them to gather their belongings. John takes his case, thankful they'd packed light, and gives Sherlock the briefcase and his, motioning towards his gun, indicating he wanted a hand free. Sherlock nods once in understanding, then gives the room one last look, making sure they hadn't forgotten anything. John pulls Sherlock through the Inn, and out the back door. No one is in sight when they leave, but he still can't shake the feeling that someone is watching. Turning to make sure Sherlock is on his heels, he takes off at a sprint, heading away from the center of town towards an old abandoned building he'd once played in. Sherlock follows John close, keeping his eyes out for anyone or anything. The building is little more than bricks and timber now, but it offers some protection. Set back from the road, it also lets them watch for anyone coming. Sherlock pings Mycroft their location, then sits with his back against John's. Each of them watching the end of the road.

""So... Someone knows we're digging, and wants to kill us?"" John asks, keeping his voice low. ""Why?""

""I don't know.. either we know something they want to know or they don't want us to find something out. We need more data. And security.."" Sherlock frowns, holding the briefcase close.

""Bad timing and all.."" John says, getting up, ""But I need a piss.""

He doesn't go far, the building and the cover of dark provide enough shelter that he knows he doesn't risk a charge for public indecency. But he goes far enough that neither he or Sherlock will have to smell it while they wait.

Coming back, he settles into the same spot and rests his head against Sherlock.

""I fail to see how this is so dangerous,"" he complains, knowing that Sherlock was as confused as he was.

""We weren't followed up here. I would have noticed someone trailing us for five hours...""

""No. They were waiting. Waiting for us. Waiting for someone to come digging."" Sherlock frowns. ""Maybe your dad knew more than we think.""

""Think there is more in the house somewhere? If he had one hidden compartment, chances are good he'd have two or more."" John drags his hand through his hair and stiffens. ""Lights, coming my way. Car, it looks like, not torches.""

Sherlock stiffens and looks at the car. ""Mycroft said there'd be a signal.""

The car pulls up and the door opens, classical music pouring out.

Sherlock relaxes. ""It's our ride."" He nods and leads John out, the song being a piano and violin duet mummy used to make Sherlock and Mycroft play.

John doesn't relax once he's in the car. His gun presses against his back, reminding him of the danger lurking in the night. His hand instinctively finds Sherlock's and he squeezes their fingers together.

""I'm glad we have a habit of working over dinner... if those papers had been in the car."" he says, ""Not only would we lose information... but... it's my dads...""

""I know."" Sherlock kisses Johns knuckles. ""I'm sure Mycroft will have us under surveillance now just in case if anything. Well have him send us a scanner and we can copy all the papers.""

John nods, and settles back, letting Sherlock comfort him through their bond. When they get back to his house, John has the driver stop down the street. With the car idling, John looks over at Sherlock and purses his lips. He knows Sherlock won't like what he's about to propose, but it's their best option.

""Wait here. It will take me two minutes to walk to the house, another five to clear it. If you don't hear from me in eight minutes, you are to drive off and get back up. Keep my dad's research safe.""

Sherlock opens his mouth to argue but John silences him with a kiss.

""All three of us going together won't end well. I know how to clear a building, you don't. You being here, with the means to escape is the best option.""

Sherlock frowns. ""Take the agent.""

""No,"" John says firmly, kissing Sherlock once more. ""No.""

Before Sherlock has time to complain John's stepping out of the car and gripping his gun. Flicking the safety off, he took off at a brisk walk towards his childhood house. Glad that the key had been in his pocket, and not in the rental car, he slipped in quietly through the back and went over the house room by room. When he reached Harry's old room, he pulled down the staircase to the attic and checked the crawl space above. The home empty, he leaned against the nearest wall and pulled his mobile out. Seven minutes had passed, so he sent a short text.



All clear



Then went back to the living room to wait. Not liking the way the shadows made his home feel unsafe, he turned on all the lights downstairs while he waited. Sherlock goes in as soon as he gets the text. ""I should be angry at you for putting yourself in danger like that but it's also hot so.. it balances out.""

""I know,"" John says, letting his Alpha pull him into a strong embrace. ""I am a bit sexy when I go all James Bond, aren't I?""

Sherlock hums and nods, holding John close. ""It is. It turns me on when you're all cool and suave and in charge."" He mumbles and kisses John deeply. 

Mycroft's underling clears his throat in the doorway, but John just waves him off. His fight-or-flight no longer in high gear, and the adrenaline wearing off, he feels shaky and a bit sick to his stomach. But Sherlock's scent, and his hands along his back, sooth his tense body, and soon he's just left with his gut rolling.

""We can sleep in my parents bed tonight, I guess..."" John says, wrinkling his nose. ""Though, I don't need you deducing anything about how they slept."" His stomach clenches and he groans, flopping down on the sofa. ""If I had known we'd be running for our lives I wouldn't have had three beers.""

""I'll flip the mattress and make the bed."" Sherlock goes to get John a glass of water before making the bed.

John tries to drink the water, but just one sip of it makes his stomach threaten to upheave. When Sherlock comes back downstairs, he's curled up on his side with his mother's blanket draped over him.

""John?"" Sherlock frowns and kneels next to him, pressing his hand to John's forehead.

""Fine."" John says softly then forces himself to sit up. ""Just tired from the drive. Then ate too much, and probably drank too much."" Forcing a smile on his face he turns to the third man in the room. ""What are the chances of getting more backup, so Sherlock and I can sleep? Maybe some food delivered, and toiletries?""

The man simply nods, then steps away while lifting his phone to his ear.

""Something tells me someone should be awake at all times,"" John explains, pulling Sherlock with him towards the stairs, ""But we've been on our feet all bloody day, and neither of us are in the right frame of mind to stay up and stare at shadows.""

""I'm sure Mycroft is sending more. The agent arrived too soon to be from the city. He was here already."" Sherlock helps John up and takes him up to bed, keeping John's mother's blanket around him.

Wanting a shower, but remembering from his walkthrough that the bathroom had been empty of everything save for a single roll of toilet paper, John lets Sherlock bundle him into bed.

""Used to sleep in here, during storms."" John said softly, as he kicked his trousers off and shoved them over the edge of the bed with his feet. ""Seems silly now, to be afraid of thunder.""

""It's loud and jarring and the wind makes noises outside. It's perfectly logical."" Sherlock helps John into bed. ""Let me get a bowl or something in case you feel sick.""

John tries to shrug Sherlock off, but the effort makes his head spin. Thankfully faint scents of his parents lull him into a half asleep state. He stirs when Sherlock enters the room, and shuts the door behind him.

""Should we be worried about your brother snatching up the papers while we sleep?""

""I have them here,"" Sherlock says and puts the briefcase under the mattress. ""They won't be able to get it without waking us.""

Oh hey! An explosion!? Interesting....


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

On the morning of the third day spent back in his childhood home, John wakes up hoping to find his stomach settled. Instead, he rolls out of bed and rushes to the bathroom, doing his best to get sick as quietly as possible, not wanting to face Sherlock's concerned eyes.

He hadn't been much help over the last few days while Sherlock searched the house. He'd mostly been on the sofa, nibbling biscuits and watered down tea.

Washing his face, he sits on the edge of the tub while scrubbing a toothbrush over his teeth to rid himself of the taste of bile. As far as bugs went, it was mild, but he was glad that Sherlock hadn't caught it yet.

""John? Are you alright?"" Sherlock knocks gently at the door. He didn't like this. Not one bit. ""Maybe you should see a doctor? You've barely been able to keep anything down for days now. That's not like you. I've never seen you vomit before this week."" He raises the urge to pace. His mate is sick and he doesn't know why.

""Just a bug, love."" John says after spitting into the sink and washing the toothpaste down the drain. ""Probably got it from one of the kids at my aunts.""

He opens the door and smiles weakly at his mate. ""Plus, I am a doctor. Technically I just saw one, when I looked in the mirror.""

Sherlock frowns and nuzzles John since John had banned kisses so Sherlock doesn't catch anything even though Sherlock argued that doesn't make sense.

""I don't like seeing you like this."" He mumbles. He had found several more stashes of papers and even some interviews with other couples, anonymous.

""Close your eyes then?"" John jokes as he pulls from Sherlock's embrace.

""Think I'll try some toast today, if you're willing to make me some."" He says, heading downstairs while his stomach wasn't rolling. ""Hopefully today I can start scanning these pages into a computer.""

Over the past two days, John had managed to create a sort of system. He'd taken multi coloured folders and had sorted the pages into three stacks.

One containing letters written by his parents. Another for the questions his dad wrote down, and their answers, which were easily spotted by the number circled in the top corner. The third folder contained anything else they'd found. Newspaper clippings, copies of bonding certificates and reports, and letters written by other people to his parents.

He'd been too busy sorting to stop and read much, but having a system created would make life easier for both of them.

""Ha Ha."" Sherlock mocks a laugh at John's joke and follows him downstairs. He goes to make John some toast and gets him some electrolyte drink that helps vomiting.

It takes him twenty minutes, but John manages to eat the toast, and most of his drink while sitting up on the sofa. Reaching for a new stack of papers he glances through the topmost pages, then stops short.

""Sherlock!"" He calls. When Sherlock enters the room looking scared, John rolls his eyes. ""I'm fine, but look at this.""

He holds the picture up and shows him the photocopy of his parent's bonding records. It includes photos and all the documents John had just had to sign. But among the photos was a picture of his dad, for once smiling straight at the camera, with a fresh bite on his neck.

""Dad did it too... had them record it.""

""Oh wow.."" Sherlock subconsciously reaches up and rubs his neck as he looks at the picture.

""Not sure if it helps us though,"" John says, scrubbing a hand over his face. ""Truthfully, I don't even know what we're looking for.""

""At first I think we were looking for proof and we found that."" Sherlock nods to the papers. ""Now we have to figure out what to do with it..""

""Finding proof got our car blown up."" Sighing John slumps back against the sofa and pushes the rest of his drink away from where the scent won't bother him as much. ""Something tells me if we keep digging worse will happen... Is Mrs. Hudson safe?""

Sherlock nods. ""Mycroft is watching her. I had her go to her sister's."" He sits with John.

""Are there any more, you think? In the house?"" He asks, looking around imagining papers lining the walls.

""He spent a lot of time in his shed out back... we should check there as well."" John looks over at Sherlock and notes how his brows are furrowed. With a grunt, he kicks Sherlock's shins.

""Would you stop looking at me like I'm dying? Look, I've kept the toast down.""

""I know. I.. You smell off.."" Sherlock frowns, trying to figure out if a sickness can make someone smell different.

""Smell off?"" John says while narrowing his eyes. ""I shouldn't smell different because of a bug. I don't think.""

John lifts his wrist to his nose and inhales, wondering what it is that Sherlock's smelling. All he smells is skin, and home, and something soft.

""What's it smell like?""

""I don't know. It's subtle. Mild. Maybe it's because you're home?"" Sherlock frowns and leans in, sniffing John.

""Probably."" John agrees. ""I haven't been home since... well, mum. So it makes sort of sense. It's probably an emotional response.""

John's stomach begins to complain again, so he distracts Sherlock by giving him a push. ""Go check out the shed. Should be a key by the door before you exit the kitchen.""

Sherlock sighs and nods. ""Fine. If you need me or find something call me."" He finally gets up and heads to the back door.

As soon as Sherlock is out the door, John is up and heading for the nearest bathroom. Not for the first time in his life, he hugs the cold porcelain as he upends the contents of his meager breakfast.

Annoyed, but feeling slightly better not having anything in his stomach, he heads back to the living room and begins sorting through the papers once more.

Sherlock is outside for an hour. When he finally comes back in he's carrying a dirty rusted waterproof safe box.

John takes one look at the box and feels a wave of emotion roll over him. He'd seen his dad with that box countless times. While he and Harry had been playing in the back garden, their dad would sit inside his shed, hunched over something with that very box between his feet.

John had always assumed it held tools, but now looking at it he realized he'd been watching his dad try to solve the very problem they were now having.

It gave him an idea. Ignoring Sherlock's questioning gaze John goes upstairs and into his old room. It takes him a few minutes to go through the boxes but eventually he finds it. The book his mother used to read to him. The one that told the tale of Alphas and Omegas living in harmony.

He hurries back downstairs and goes into the kitchen, finding a knife. Then he does the one thing his book-loving heart swore to never do. Taking care not to damage anything, John slices the book blot from the case. He's barely got it off when something flutters to the ground.

Placing the knife down he bends down and picks up a yellowed sheet of paper. Turning to Sherlock, who was now watching him with curiosity, he says.

""Mum always said there was more to this story than the eye could see. I always thought she meant the pictures.""

""They certainly left a trail for you,"" Sherlock says softly.


 My sweet John, 



 Your father and I have devoted our lives to giving you and your sister the best lives we can. But I'm afraid we've stumbled upon something that might shatter our happy nest. We've taken every precaution we could, but still, it wasn't enough. 



 We've been looking into our bond, and finding people like us. Along the way, we've stirred up the hornet's nest. A group of men, unnamed as far as we can tell, approached us while we were on holiday and warned us to stop digging. 



 Your father is... was... a curious man. He refused to their faces, telling them we had every right to know more about our bonds than the government told us. I'm afraid it was foolish, though I applaud his bravery. 



 Last night I watched my Mate. My soulmate suffered what the doctors say was a natural heart attack. Only, I could feel that it wasn't his body betraying him, but something forging. The doctors wouldn't listen when I begged them to check him for poisoning... 



 My dear boy, your dad and I share a unique bond. A bond so rare that we thought we were alone in the world with our discovery. Over the years, the bond grew so strong that I could sense him his body, his mind, even his location. I just knew, even though I didn't know how I knew. 



 Last night I felt that presence vanish. Something I hope you'll never have to feel. I had hoped for more time. To be there when you're grown and to tell you about this bond. But I feel my life is destined for the same fate as Hank's. All we can do is leave clues behind, nudge you in the right direction, and hope you're wise enough to find the answers we could not. 



 If anyone can, it is you, my love. You've always been the smart one, no offense to your sister, but she thinks with her Alpha brain. Find the answers, John. Learn what your father could not. But be safe, protect yourself and your family, if you have one. I love you, and so did your father. 



 -Mum 


John reads the letter, noting the places where her tears had smudged the ink. He feels behind him for a chair and sinks heavily into it. The weight of his mother's words drags his heart into his stomach.

He looks up at Sherlock with tears in his eyes and passes over the letter.

""Oh, John."" Sherlock kneels at John's feet as he reads.

""Yeah..."" Is all John manages to say before he can't see or think through the tears.

Sherlock's arms engulf his body. For once John finds himself happy for his small frame. He wants to curl into a ball and exist only in Sherlock's embrace.

""Murder, then?"" John croaks.

""I think so.."" Sherlock says softly, holding John tight and scenting him.

""Fuck"" it's the only thing John can think go say. What else can you say when faced with a situation like this.

Sherlock holds John and rocks him slowly. He picks John up and carries him to bed.

John lets himself be Alpha-handled. Oddly enough it calms his stomach, letting Sherlock put him to bed like a small child. He clings to the bed first, then Sherlock when his mate slips between the blankets.

Wrapped up in his parent's bed he cries harder than he's cried since the day his mum died. He cries until there's nothing left in him, and all he can manage are full body shakes. Clinging to Sherlock's damp shirt he whispers, ""we need to be careful. I can't lose you.""

""I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you."" Sherlock holds John close and scents him. He didn't want to involve Mycroft any more than he was but Mycroft's people could keep them safer.

""Whatever you want to do we'll do. We can stop digging. Lay low."" He says softly, knowing John wouldn't let this go.

""Lay low, and let whoever murdered my father to remain free?"" John sits up and shakes his head. ""No. This is what we do. Solve crimes and put horrible people in jail.""

He wipes his eyes and clears his throat. ""This time it's personal. I just have to not get caught up in the emotion. We should visit my Uncle, my dad's brother. I wonder if he believes my Mum.""

""Well, he may have a clearer head about everything since he's a beta. Seeing things from an outsider perspective as it was."" Sherlock rubs John's back.

""If I don't eat or drink anything... I should be fine to go today."" John says then begins patting the blankets to find his mobile.

Sherlock finds it first and hands it over. Taking it John texts his Uncle and sets up a time to meet him later that day.

""He said he'll come here tonight after he gets off work.""

""You can't starve yourself."" Sherlock frowns, already planning out ways to drag John to the doctor's if he needs to.

""No, but I can hold off on eating directly before he gets here."" John sighs turning on the bed to face his mate. ""Face it. No one else is sick, not you, and unfortunately not any of your brother's underlings. I thought it was the beer, then I thought it was food poisoning. Now I just think it's stress.""

He knows Sherlock isn't completely convinced so he continues.

""We're recently bonded, my body is still trying to figure out how to be an Omega who isn't on suppressants or contraceptives. Then I come back here,"" he gestures to the room and the house. ""my system is going haywire. It's probably why I didn't get pregnant during my last heat.""

Sherlock frowns and cuddles John close. He does make a compelling argument. ""I just.. for some reason I'm not convinced. My instincts itch."" He nuzzles John.

""Now if I were pregnant this would all make sense. The extra sensitivity,"" John looks at the spot on Sherlock's shirt that is still damp from his tears, ""and then this could all just be chalked up to be morning sickness.""

He gets up off the bed and grimaces as the few remaining contents in his stomach slosh.

""Instead it's just another way my body is biting me in the arse for suppressing the natural order for so long.""

Sherlock sits up and watches John. ""If you throw up one more time I'm taking you to the hospital whether I have to carry you or drag you.""

""Remember who owns the gun in this relationship, Sherlock,"" John warns gently. ""I'm in no mood to have doctors shove their equipment up my arse just because I'm an Omega. I'm going back downstairs. We still have a lot of work to do.""

""This isn't about me trying to control you, John. This is about me trying to make sure you're alright. And if I have to protect you from yourself then I will. You'd the same and more for me. You have in the past. Just because we're working this case where everything is so omega and alpha focused don't forget that I never gave a toss about any of it and I still don't. You may not be in the mood to be poked and prodded but if you're sick I will not let you die from your own stubbornness."" Sherlock's face is hard and determined. ""So threatening me with your gun. You already know that I'd die to protect you so it's a moot point.""

John crosses his arms and turns to face Sherlock. He's ready to fight, but even as he opens his mouth to tell Sherlock where he can shove it something crosses over their bond. He can feel Sherlock's concern. It's palpable and deep, settling into John's mind like a weighted blanket. He reminds himself that Sherlock hasn't seen the battlefield, not like he has. He hasn't seen dying men or heard their moans. What Sherlock is seeing right now, is his mate suffering from something modern medicine can cure.

""Give me until tomorrow at least?"" He asks in a defeated tone. ""I already threw up breakfast while you were out in the shed, so it's safe to say lunch will go down just as well..."" He drags a hand through his hair and sighs he can feel Sherlock's concern deepen. ""If I can't keep down breakfast tomorrow, I'll go, you won't have to drag me.""

""Thank you,"" Sherlock says softly, upset John didn't tell him he grew up breakfast but relieved John agrees to go to the doctor if it continues.

""I love you,"" Sherlock says, he always says it after they have an argument or a small spat. He needs to make sure John hears it as well as feels it.

""Mmm,"" John says, nodding and walking to Sherlock. He wraps his arms around Sherlock's waist and sighs. ""I love you too, you git.""

He stays in Sherlock's arms for a long while. Sherlock's scent helps calm his stomach and nerves. Soon his breathing has returned to normal and the last traces of his tears are gone. Looking up into the face he'd grown so used to seeing by his side he smiles and nods his head towards the door. ""Bring me down a box of books, I'll go through them for any loose papers and I'll try to keep down some biscuits.""

""Okay."" Sherlock smiles and kisses John's forehead before doing as John says.

The morning ticks by minute by long minute. Around lunchtime Sherlock brings John another bottle of electrolyte-infused water, and a packet of hobnobs. An hour goes by before John realizes that he's eaten half the packet of biscuits, and consumed two drinks, without throwing up. Pleased, but not wanting to make a big deal out of it, he simply returns to the stack of papers and books.

Not wanting to tear open every book his family had ever owned, John instead ran his fingers along the covers and inspected the corners for lifting glue. Once he thought he'd found something, only to cut the book open and find it was just old and worn. He was just beginning to grow frustrated when Sherlock looked up from the stack of books he'd been pouring over and held up one of his mother's gardening books, his eyes bright with discovery.

""What? What did you find?"" John asked quickly.

""It's not a book, John. It's a journal. Your mother's journal."" Sherlock grins. ""Your dad's notes are all on loose papers. Your mum kept things more organized. Hidden in plain sight."" He passes the book to John. He notices how John is keeping down his snacks and drink but doesn't say anything in case it somehow jinxed John's progress.

John reaches for it eagerly and flips through the pages. He smiles, seeing more of his mother's flowery handwriting in neat straight lines.

""Got my handwriting from my dad, and note-taking skills from her,"" John says fondly while skimming over the first few pages. The first entries talk about life as a young teenager, what it was like to expect her first heat, knowing that after it was over she'd be eligible to be paired with an Alpha. As he reads her write about knowing her life would soon be over, that she'd be sold off to whichever Alpha was willing to pay for her, his stomach turned. But this time it wasn't the queasy feeling that came from eating bad food. This was anger manifesting into something tangible.

His mother describes meeting the man who'd placed a bid on her. The panic she felt at meeting a man twice her age. He traces his fingers over her words and feels his heartbreak for her. He had known that life hadn't been sunshine and rainbows for her, but hearing her describe it in such vivid detail made him angry.

""How could anyone do that to their child..."" he seethes to the pages, then reads on. What he reads next makes his heart stop. With a tremor in his voice, he calls Sherlock's name to get his attention. ""Sherlock, listen...""


Hank and I were in love. From the moment we met on the first day of Year 9, we knew. He was two weeks older than me, a point he teased me about endlessly. We had plans to marry and start a family, but when my parents introduced me to my intended Alpha our fantasy came crashing down.



I was barely sixteen and late presenting. All the other Omegas in our class had already experienced their first heat. But I wasn't worried, it gave Hank and I that much more time together.



My parents indulged our dating, if only because they knew it would be over soon. So when Hank showed up one night, dressed to the nines with a bouquet of flowers, asking if I'd like to see a film with him, no one objected. We did see that film, though we were too busy snogging to watch most of it. Then after, we ended up at his place and found his parents out. As teenagers might... we had each other that night. He looked at me, looming over me in the darkness of his room and asked me four words I'd been longing to hear. Can I bite you?



We didn't think it would create a bond, as I hadn't had my first heat yet. We just wanted to know what it felt like. He bit me, and I bit back. By the time we were spent, we knew it had been for real. I could feel him inside my soul, and he said the same. We cuddled until we heard his parents come home, then Hank snuck me out the back. My family was asleep, so I had no trouble getting to my room without being spotted.



I was fortunate enough to have a stomach bug for the next week, giving me time to find a way to hide my bond bite. If my parents saw, surely they would have forced me to have it removed. He was concerned over my illness, calling the house to check in on me. But when I returned to school, using a scarf to cover my neck, his eyes widened and I swear I've never seen that man look so panicked in my life. He pulled me into an empty classroom and shoved his nose against my stomach. A test from the chemist later that afternoon proved what his instincts already knew. I was pregnant.


We devised a plan, a fake heat where we'd claim to bond. The heat and bonding resulting in my pregnancy. Knowing that there was still a chance that my intended Alpha would take me, and Hank's child. But it was our best option. And thankfully for us, it worked.""

Sherlock listens intently and frowns. ""She didn't have a heat? She got pregnant without.."" Suddenly it dawns on Sherlock and he pushes John back against the couch. He ignores John's protests as he pulls John's jumper up and presses his nose to his belly, sniffing.

Pup his instincts supply as soon as he smells the soft delicate scent. He looks up at John, wide-eyed and frozen. For the first time in his whole life, his mind is still and silent beyond one work. Pup

John's still mumbling about being manhandled when Sherlock's eyes meet his. He looks like a rabbit in the headlights, wide-eyed and unsure which way to jump. He starts to push Sherlock away when his much slower mind catches up. He looks from the letter to Sherlock, then down to his stomach. He can hear the low buzz of conversation from two of Mycroft's agents in the other room, but he pushes them out of his mind.

""Oh... you mean? I'm..."" He places a hand on his stomach, just above Sherlock's head. There's nothing to feel, of course, but somehow focusing on the area feels right. ""We're... going to be parents?""

Sherlock nods slowly as his brain comes back online, processing everything. ""Pup."" He said since it's the only word rattling around in his skull.

""We should do a test, to be sure,"" John says though the thought is laughable. If this was the result of their coupling from the other night, surely it would be too soon for any over-the-counter test. ""But how? And why'd I get sick the next day? Morning sickness usually comes later.""

Sherlock doesn't seem willing, or able, to move so he lays back against the sofa and lets his mate scent his stomach. It's strange and ticklish, but it calms his upset stomach. When Sherlock sticks his tongue out and begins licking, John puts a hand in Sherlock's hair and laughs. ""Scenting is one thing, but licking me like I'm a damned ice lolly is another.""

""Pup. Our pup. Inside you."" Sherlock mumbles as he rubs his face against John's stomach. His brain was seemingly very slow to come back online and his instincts guiding him.

""Guess you get to drag me to the doctors after all."" John groans, but he's smiling. Carding his fingers through Sherlock's hair he silently thanks his mother for documenting everything.

Sherlock kisses and nuzzles John's belly. ""Mm, it all makes sense. Why omega's can only get pregnant during a heat. That's because it's not with their soulmate. That's why conception rates are so low. They're only fertile a handful of times a year. Soulmates can have pups whenever without a heat."" He mumbles, his brain working things out.

""Everything. Everything points to soulmates being the correct way. Selling omega's means controlling the supply of births. Less omega's mean higher prices which keep the rich and elite in power because they're the ones producing omega's. They don't care about betas having children unless by a miracle it turns out to be an omega. This is the way it's supposed to be. Finding your soulmate. Being connected. Content."" He rambles, brain making connections.

Sherlock remembers the day John came into the lab at Bart's. How each of his hairs stood on end and his alpha howled. It didn't make sense to him, how his instincts were so drawn to this beta when he never cared to be close to anyone before. How he thought of any reason to keep John in his life. Give him excitement, purpose, heal his leg, somewhere to live, companionship.

""I knew.."" He says after being silent for some time. ""I knew when you came into Bart's. I couldn't think. It was so distracting. I had to get out. And then you moved in and stayed. It only got more intense. Lestrade, I told him. I told him what I was thinking and feeling because I didn't know what it meant. I'd never felt like that before or thought that way before. He gave me a look like he pitied me but he was happy at the same time?"" He says, still confused.

""He said I was in love with you and I told him that was ridiculous. I didn't have feelings like that for anyone. Never had and how I doubted it would be for a beta who was careful to keep his distance from me except when we had to pretend to be a couple."" He's still rambling but he can't help it, all of this had been in his head for so long and now it made sense.

He presses his nose to John's belly again, trying to smell more. It smells like him and John and something new. Sweet. Fragile.

""No more. No more selling omega's to the highest bidder. No more unfulfilled soulmates. We'll figure it out. There has to be a way to figure it out. Blood samples or pheromones or something. There has to be something tangible. Something we can quantify and connect. To bring mates together. They deserve this. This feeling. This connection. Where secondary sex doesn't dictate what box they have to live in the rest of their life but a freedom to be who they are and do what they want."" Sherlock rubs John's tighs, still kneeling between his legs.

He needs data, proof. Samples from soulmates and similarities so they can find a way to track and match soulmates together. He can't imagine going through life the way he had before. He didn't know how empty it was. How alone he felt. How he was just drifting and doing what he thought was what he wanted.

""Our pups will not grow up like this. I won't have it. They won't be oppressed and made to conform for the likes of dullard uneducated masses. Whoever blew up our car knows. They know all this and more. We have to figure out who that is."" He growls softly.

John listens to his Alpha, petting his head in a soothing manner. Sherlock's voice softens the edges of his panic and shock. He thinks back to their first meeting and smiles. Remembering the brash man, with the shirt collar undone.

""When I saw you, I thought I'd either like to fuck him or tell him to fuck off. You were a pretty boy, after my life in the military. It was like seeing colour again, after seeing nothing but camouflage and sand for years. It scared me how I didn't want to stop looking at you. I didn't want to be seen as the mooning Omega, drooling at the closest Alpha.""

The rest of Sherlock's words sink in and he nods grimly. The most important case they could ever imagine had just been dropped on their laps, and all they had to go by was his parent's notes, and whispers in the wind.

Sherlock nuzzles and sniffs John's belly for a bit longer. ""You do realize I knocked you up on your childhood bed in your parent's house."" He snorts against John's belly.

""For fucks sake..."" John groans and finally manages to push Sherlock's head off of him. They catch each other's eyes and the unbridled mirth in Sherlock's gaze makes John burst out laughing. He laughs until his sides hurt then rolls his eyes so hard they risk rolling back into his skull. ""Better than my parent's bed,"" he laughs out.

Their noise brings one of the agents in, investigating what the ruckus was about. When neither John nor Sherlock is forthcoming, he shrugs and walks away. Clearly not finding manic laughter a security risk.

Sherlock grins and licks his lips. ""My mate. Pregnant with my pup."" He all but purrs, his alpha side deeply pleased.

""Good news, I'm not dying,"" John says, wiping a tear from the corner of his eye and stamping down the last of his laughter. Rubbing his stomach he smiles fondly at his Mate then tugs his jumper back down. ""Can't believe my mum got pregnant without even having her first heat. And they faked it! You heard Aunt Jennie, she said they were gone for days, she came back bonded and pregnant. It was a bloody coverup!""

""Quite ingenious on their part."" Sherlock chuckles, resisting the urge to push John's jumper back up and plastering himself to his belly. ""I'll look through the rest of your mum's books and see if she left any more journals.""

""I can't imagine the fear... Bonding to the person you loved while knowing that your Alpha parent was in the midst of negotiating your sale. They're lucky he didn't push to finalize that sale..."" John sits back up and prepares to go back over the rest of the entry, but stops short. ""Do you think he had my dad killed?""

""I... I don't know. We have to find out who it was that was going to buy your mother."" Sherlock frowns.

""We can ask my Uncle tonight, if not, we can see if my aunt knows."" John grimaces at the thought of returning to her house, but the answers they need outweigh any of his personal discomforts.

Finding himself hungry, he wanders into the kitchen and makes himself toast, while the kettle boils.

""We're not going back to see her. Whatever she knows we can find out some other way."" Sherlock follows John, not letting more than a few feet of space between them.

John puts teabags into two mugs then frowns.

""Am I okay having caffeine? Christ, I can't remember...""

""It's fine. Just try and limit it to one cup a day."" Sherlock says, having read as much as he could on the do's and don'ts when they were trying to get pregnant before.

John lets out a relieved sigh, pours hot water into the cups, and pops the bread into the toaster. While waiting for the bread to brown he pulls Sherlock into his arms.

""Pup... or, pups?"" He says happily, ""explains why my stomach felt better any time you were close, and probably why those damn hobnobs didn't bother me. They're going to be junk food eaters like you are.""

Sherlock chuckles softly and nuzzles John. ""Makes sense. You are carrying a pup and or pups so it would be easier for you to handle things I like. Comforting at least."" He kisses John tenderly. ""I don't know how many. It's probably far too soon to make a distinction. I wonder if it will smell different? If you're carrying multiples.""

""Mmm. I wonder."" John says, then jumps when the toaster pops. He ignores Sherlock's laughter, quite used to the teasing by now. He couldn't help it if a toaster, of all things, made him jump. Even if he could perform a life saving surgery with explosives going off around him.

Slathering butter and honey on the toast he lets Sherlock fix their tea, then they take the food into the other room. He pours over the loose letters from his dad while he eats, then when he's done he lays back and calls Sherlock over.

""Come scent me, let's see if it helps me keep the toast down.""

Sherlock doesn't have to be told twice and he immediately goes, scenting John liberally.

I'm terrible at naming chapters. I wanted name this ""Letters in the walls, and a bun in the oven"" but that just felt long. Plus, the letter wasn't in the wall, was it? - Tindo


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

The back door opens, but John doesn't look up. They would have heard shouting (or worse) if it were a stranger. He inhales deeply, loving the excitement lingering in Sherlock's scent. But instead of just smelling his mate he smells something lemony.

Groaning, John rolls his head back and sees the upside-down shape of Mycroft Holmes standing in the doorway to his childhood living room.

""Well, if it isn't Uncle Mycroft,"" John says before realizing what he'd said.

Mycroft raises a brow and looks them over. ""I wasn't expecting a happy announcement quite so soon."" He hummed, knowing John didn't conceive after his last heat.

""What are you doing here, Uncle Mikey?"" Sherlock snorts, knowing Mycroft hates nicknames.

Mycroft rolls his eyes. ""I have information.""

""What is it?"" John asked, placing a hand on the nape of Sherlock's neck, letting him know he didn't want Sherlock to move.

Mycroft sighs and moves across the room to sit in the single armchair. Leaning his umbrella against the side of his chair, he folds his hands over one knee and leans forward.

""Sherlock has, for once, been keeping me updated with your findings. I was able to unearth the name of the man who was supposed to buy your mother.""

John sits up, dislodging Sherlock. He looks across the room to the man. In a cold voice, he simply asks ""Who?""

""A man by the name of Jacobs Moriarty. He dabbles in sales"" Mycroft says with distaste, letting John know that whatever it is Jacobs sold was just a front. ""Wealthy man, untouchable. He saw the advert your grandparents posted when your mother approached legal age and was the highest bidder.""

""Let me guess, he was pissed that my dad knocked her up, but having someone else's pup in the picture wasn't in his plan?""

""Quite so,"" Mycroft says with a nod.

Sherlock stills, remembering the name Moriarty from the cabbie. ""Is he local? Or has local contacts?"" He asks, wondering if there's a connection to the car bomb.

""Oxford,"" Mycroft says with a shake of his head. ""Though his business takes him all over the country, and abroad. I wouldn't put it past him to have connections as vastly spread out as I do.""

Tugging his shirt back down once again, John sits up and folds one leg under him. He realizes a moment later that his mum used to sit like this, and the thought made him smile briefly.

""So, this arse put a bid in on a 16-year-old girl. To do what exactly? Get her after her first heat, or was he at least going to wait until she was 18?""

""Unsure, Doctor Watson... John,"" Mycroft amends, ""They were still in the early stages of negotiation when your parents bonded.""

""Oh... about that,"" John says, quickly explaining the circumstances of his parent's bonding. Mycroft raises an eyebrow, and says ""Remarkable people, having remarkable children.""

""Hold on, is that a compliment?"" John says, looking from Mycroft to Sherlock.

Sherlock raises a brow and looks Mycroft over. ""Oh. Why?"" He frowns. ""You talked to Harry. For what reason?""

""After the incident with your car, I felt it prudent of me to check in on John's sister. We are unsure of the target. It could be John, or it could be his parent's research. Regardless, Harry is still involved, if only remotely.""

Mycroft sits back and gives John a careful look. ""I've removed her to a secure location. One that has no access to alcohol. It should be... beneficial.""

""Right, thanks..."" John says, instantly feeling guilty that he hadn't thought of his sister.

""Meanwhile, we need to know more about the physical changes a perfect match causes in the body. John, what are the chances you have had bloodwork done recently?""

John was taken aback by Mycroft asking for his records rather than just taking them. He assumed it had something to do with Sherlock being his Alpha, and Mycroft attempting to go through the proper channels.

""I had a full workup done before I enlisted, and after they sent me home. Sherlock will have to sign off on you getting copies, but you have my permission.""

Sherlock nods. ""Get the paperwork and I'll sign it."" He hums. ""And you have my blood work from.."" He sighs. ""From rehab.""

""Already acquired,"" Mycroft says, reaching into his breast pocket for a medical release form.

He passes it to John, who checks it over then hands it to Sherlock with a nod.

""I assume we should get a full blood panel done now that we're bonded. Hopefully, the baby won't skew the results too much."" John says, placing a hand over his stomach.

""If anything I'd think it would amplify the effect."" Sherlock hums as he signs the papers, annoyed he's the one having to sign and not John.

""Do you need us to go somewhere specific?"" John asks, ""I can draw the blood myself if you get me the kit.""

""I'll have it sent first thing tomorrow.""

""What are we looking for?"" John asks quietly as Sherlock settles on the sofa beside him.

""We aren't sure yet,"" Mycroft says uneasily and John got the feeling that Mycroft disliked not knowing more than Sherlock.

Sherlock thinks. ""Betas."" He says suddenly.

""Betas?"" John and Mycroft both say, turning to look at the lanky detective who was currently in the process of leaning forward to rub his face on John's stomach.

""Oi..."" John says with a huff of laughter. ""Think, love. The pup can wait two minutes for his dad to be brilliant.""

""Beta's before they have children they have health checks to make sure they have compatible blood types and such. So that the pup doesn't get anything passed down to them or the mother has ill effects with a second pregnancy."" Sherlock mumbles, rubbing his face against John's belly again. He can't help it. It's like he's being pulled. ""We're looking for comparability so why not look at the cellular level? If we're not biologically compatible it wouldn't work.""

""Makes sense,"" Johns says with a smile, his hand finding its way back to Sherlock's hair.

""Gives us something to start with, at least.""

""Whether or not the outcome is to have children is a moot point. We should also look at pheromones and scents. John likes my scent but Mycroft's is a turn-off. Why? We're related. It has to do with a biological component."" Sherlock mumbles, scenting John.

""Maybe, because your blood is similar enough that nature needed a way to guide me to you, not your brother?"" John says, honestly just guessing at this point. ""You're both Alphas, same parents... it wouldn't hurt to compare your blood as well, Mycroft.""

""I'll see to it,"" Mycroft says, watching his brother with soft eyes. ""While you look the part of a fool, Brother mine... you seem happy.""

""The happiest fool of all the seven seas."" Sherlock mumbles, nuzzling against John's belly. ""It's physically imperative I do this or else I can't think. Even less than I already am.""

""You should also look and see if there are samples of John's parents' DNA on file. We need a larger pool to sample from. We need to find others. Others with soulmate bonds. If we have any hope of figuring this out we need more data. We also need to look into folk and fairy tales. Especially those perpetuated by omegas. We need more omega input. They're the key. Omegas are the key."" He resists licking John's belly but only just. He's not sure if he's making any sense but that doesn't really matter to him since he can smell his pup.

""Is there a room I can use to make a few phone calls?"" Mycroft asks John, a bemused smile on his face.

""Yeah, my old room."" John directs him up the stairs then turns to his mate. ""This is going to be a problem, isn't it? We're going to be doing the bloody grocery shopping and all of a sudden my shirt's going to be lifted and your head pressed against my stomach. Still... I kept food down finally.""

""Mm, it'll get better. Maybe."" Sherlock mumbles and then laughs. ""Mycroft is going to be able to smell the sex we had on the bed.""

""Why do you think I sent him there, and not Harry's room?"" John laughs.

""So... Moriarty?"" He asks cautiously, knowing that word was a sore spot for Sherlock. It reminded him there were things even his vast intellect didn't know about.

Sherlock hums and nods. ""It keeps coming up. Now we know it's a real person. And real people can be dealt with.""

John closes his eyes and allows himself a moment to enjoy Sherlock's closeness and the newfound knowledge that he was carrying their pup. Less than three days old, it was already the most loved child John knew.

He listened to the sound of footsteps above. Mycroft pacing, just like Sherlock did when he was annoyed.

""I want to go back to the ocean,"" John says softly, looking down at Sherlock.

""Whenever anything happened, good or bad. I'd ride my bike there. This,"" he says, placing a hand on his stomach, ""is good, and I need to go.""

""Alright. I'll make us a thermos of tea and tell Mycroft. You'll need a thicker jumper. It's windy out."" Sherlock kisses John and slowly starts to peel himself away.

""I'm pregnant, Sherlock... not an old man who wears jumpers in the summer,"" John says, then looks down and grimaces. He is, in fact, wearing a jumper, and it's damn near summer out.

Sherlock opens his mouth in rebuttal but John points a finger at him and shakes his head once. ""No, nope. Not a word.""

""Mm fine."" Sherlock hums and finally gets up, deciding to pick his battles. He goes to tell Mycroft that they're going to the beach and Mycroft tells him to take agents. Sherlock rolls his eyes and goes down to make tea.

John picks up his mother's journal and tucks it under his arm, then retrieves his jacket. He takes it with him, while pointedly not putting it on. John had made it a point to go out of his way to disobey or ignore orders from an Alpha, and he wasn't going to start listening now just because Sherlock was outing himself as a nervous father.

They take one of the agents with them, John letting the man drive. (As driving with your Mate's head or hands constantly on your stomach would be unsafe.) He directs the man to a spot nearby, where they can be observed from a distance, allowing the agent to keep the car secure.

John picks his way across the rocks and finds one big enough to sit on. There's no sand here, but the rocks are smooth and worn from years in the sea.

""This was my spot,"" he said, staring out over the lapping water. ""I'd come here when I just needed to escape. Did you have a spot like that?""

Sherlock nods. ""The woods surrounding my grandmother's house. After Mycroft went to university I spent a lot of time with her there before I was sent to boarding school.""

""Nature..."" John nods. ""Calming, peaceful, yet alive.""

They sit for a while, the ocean waves calming John until the tension from the last few days subsided. Any time his stomach lurched, he'd pull Sherlock close and the pains would go away.

""Why do you think it's like this? The strange morning sickness? Is it because I'm supposed to be near you right now? A form of bonding, between the parents and the fetus? It isn't like this normally. An Omega's pregnancy is almost a spitting image of a Beta's. The same time frame of symptoms, gestation period... everything. The only thing that changes is fertility rate, it being higher in Omegas allowing for multiples more frequently.""

""I'm not sure. Our bond is still new as well. And I don't mean this as a derogatory thing but you are older than the average omega when they have their first pup. Maybe your body just needs to be sure I'm here. That we're in this together."" Sherlock holds John close, scenting him.

""Mmm, by now most omegas are having their last litter. And we're just getting started.""

John leans into Sherlock's warmth, enjoying being cared for.

He sits and reads his mother's journal a bit, but stops when he finds the entry describing Harry's birth. Saving it for when they were back at the house.

""We should think about heading back soon, and dinner. I don't think being out in the open like this is exactly smart, but I wanted to get some fresh air.""

""I'm sure Mycroft has this whole town crawling with agents. I've spotted at least four just sitting here."" Sherlock hums, there seems to be even more while they've been out. Maybe Uncle Mycroft had a soft spot for pups.

""We can go back whenever you like. And a light dinner. Don't want to overwhelm your stomach when you just started to calm down."" He sniffs John, seeing if there's any change. ""Oh, he couldn't smell it."" He says, realizing Mycroft couldn't smell John being pregnant.

""Alright,"" John says, settling back again and staring out over the water. They sit for ten more minutes until John is forced to admit (to himself) that Sherlock was right and the wind did have a bite to it.

Standing up he helps Sherlock to his feet then picks his way back over the rocks to the path leading back to the car. Once in the car he gets his mobile and places an order for two large pizzas for them to pick up. Hanging up he looks over to find Sherlock staring at him.

""I'm hungry,"" he says with a shrug. ""And I'm pregnant now so I can blame it on the pup.""

""Mm blame this on the pup too."" Sherlock hums and lifts John's jumper and sticks his head inside, face presses to John's belly. ""Mycroft couldn't smell it. It's faint but still, he would have picked up on it. He would have made a comment about your scent change. We're the only ones that can smell the pup. For now at least."" He kisses and licks John's belly.

""Make..."" John starts to say but begins laughing as Sherlock's tongue begins to tickle him. ""makes sense,"" he tries again ""when you bonded me, it locked my scent in for you only. They'll still be something that tells others I'm an Omega, but my unique scent is for you only now.""

John tries to fight Sherlock out of his shirt but it's no use. In the end, he's forced to accept that for now, Sherlock's face was a permanent fixture on his stomach.

Sherlock lets out a low happy growl at John's scent only being for him. Only he gets to smell John. He nuzzles and scents John's belly. He knows the pup would be microscopic at this point. Tiny tiny. So small. So fragile. He can't help but want to be close. To protect John.

Oh hello wrench, meet plot.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


When they arrived back at the house a man was standing next to his car talking to agents.



""That's him!"" John says excitedly, exiting the car the moment it stops. He leaves the pizzas on the seat for either Sherlock or Mycroft's minion to get and heads straight for the newcomer.



""Uncle!"" He cries happily, walking straight towards the man and wrapping his arms around his shoulders. They embrace quickly, then John turns to see Sherlock's holding the pizzas against his hip.



""Sherlock this is my dad's brother, Matt.""



John keeps his hand on his Uncle's arm. Though a beta the man's baseline scent is close to his father's and it reminds John of warm hugs and burying his face in his dad's chest. 
He looks at Sherlock and smiles, seeing his partner's eyes dart over his kin. Then his eyes crinkle and a small smile graces his lips as if John being happy made him happy.



Sherlock extends a hand, ""Sherlock Holmes,"" he says, introducing himself.



""Well, technically Holmes-Watson,"" John says, ""Still getting used to that. He's my Mate.""



Matt's eyes instinctively flick to John's neck then he nods once and shakes Sherlock's hand. 
John leads them into the kitchen, when Sherlock takes his coat off he hears his Uncle gasp and turns to see his uncle staring at Sherlock's neck.



""You..."" He says gently, looking from John to Sherlock, ""soulmates?""



""So you know."" Sherlock sets the pizza boxes on the table and gets some plates.



""How could I not? With my brother nose deep in it like he was."" he doesn't seem surprised when John and Sherlock nod.  Instead, he looks around the house and shrugs. ""I see why you came back, and why you called me. I'm sorry to say I don't know much. But,"" he looks over at John and gives him a warm smile, ""It is great to see you. Been following your blog. No one told me you went off and joined the army.""



""And got my doctorate."" John says, not unkindly, ""Mum made Harry promise.""



""Yeah, I remember that.""



John gestures to the table, then they all hear footsteps coming down the stairs, ""Apparently the queen could smell the food,"" he mutters to his mate who snorts before masking his mirth.



""Evening all. Nice to meet you, Mr. Watson. I'm Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother."" Mycroft introduces himself.



Sherlock opens the pizza boxes and gets John some slices on a plate, his instincts telling him to feed his mate first. 
John looks pointedly at Sherlock, then at the pizza. When Sherlock rolls his eyes (but grabs a slice for himself) John lets his face soften. He couldn't remember the last thing Sherlock had eaten, which meant it had been at least twenty-four hours since his last meal. While he appreciated Sherlock's focus, they'd already had to run for (presumably) their lives once. If they had to do so again, John wouldn't want to have to pick Sherlock up and carry him due to his mate passing out from low blood sugar.



Matt introduces himself to Mycroft, then looks out towards where his car sat in the driveway. Nodding his head, and accepting a plate from Sherlock, he asked, ""They coming in? Those two...""



""Agents,"" Mycroft says, filling in the blanks. ""They're currently on the clock. They'll eat when their shift is over.""



It takes them most of dinner to fill Matt in on everything that had happened since John had returned home. When they tell him about the incident with the car he lets out a low whistle and mentions he'd seen it on the news. John finishes by telling him about the research they'd found hidden away and shakes his head sadly.



""I never knew what they were looking into,"" John says, running a hand over his mothers journal.



""I did, to an extent. Used to watch you rugrats when they went off to chat with another couple. Remember all our movie nights?""



""You mean the nights you gave me cavities,"" John laughs gently. ""So they were off on research trips then?""



""Never could sit still those two. Even when things started getting dangerous. More than once the breaks on their car would fail, or warning notes would show up on their door. But they didn't stop... Even after Hank..."" Matt says, clearing his throat, ""Joann wouldn't give up. She knew there had to be something more to life, than forced bonds.""



""Do you remember any of the couples they talked to?"" Sherlock asks, eating under John's watchful eye.



Matt furrows his brow and scratches his index finger over his eyebrow. Sherlock notices the gesture and wonders if John's dad had exhibited the same tick, or if their children would pick up John's mannerisms.



""Not sure... There was a couple in Ulverston, name was something cook something..."" He shrugs, then drums the fingers of one hand on the table. ""Could chat with a couple my parents knew. Our parents were betas, but I remember both of their friends having bites. Things like that stick out to a kid who isn't used to seeing bond marks daily. They're in a care home not far from here.""



Matt gives John the name and address, then looks around at the half-empty house. ""It's a bit weird... seeing this place like this.""



""Yeah,"" John nods, ""I know.""



""I don't mean to be a damper but simply being here now involves Matthew. Whoever blew up the car will be watching him as well."" Mycroft hums as he finishes his slice of pizza.



John glares over at Mycroft but Matt just laughs it off.



""If you're worried you'll have to give up one of your government men to watch me, don't. Who do you think gave John the military bug? I can defend myself. And if anyone comes asking, I'll just tell them I wanted to visit my nephew and wish him well on his bonding. Still new?"" he asks, looking from John to Sherlock, then back to his nephew. ""You two keep going from moon eyes to glares.""



""New-ish."" John nods.



""New enough."" Sherlock agrees, picking up another slice of pizza when John gives him a look.



John finds himself tempted to tell his Uncle the other half of the news, but Mycroft's warning made him pause. He would tell his Uncle when it was safer. If word spread about his pregnancy it would make him a weaker target, and an easy way to gain access to Sherlock. They chatted for a while longer, both Watsons proving to Mycroft just how stubborn the Watson line was until Matt glanced at the clock and sighed.



""I should head home, the wife will be waiting. It was good to see you again, John. And wonderful to meet you, Sherlock."" He looks at Mycroft and purses his lips, then says, ""You're not half bad either. While it looks like you have a rose bush up your arse, you seem to genuinely care about these two.""



Mycroft makes a nose that is almost a stutter before masking his face and shaking Matt's hand. John walks him to the door, then gives him a final hug. ""Sorry I was a stranger. I'll do better.""



""Yeah well, it works both ways, I could have done better too,"" Matt says, then pats the pocket where his mobile is located. ""I'll stay in touch.""



John gets back to the table just in time to hear Mycroft mutter ""Watsons"" as he stands.



""Watsons indeed."" Sherlock chuckles softly.



""We're a stubborn lot,"" John says, walking up behind Sherlock and leaning over his sitting frame. He places his head on Sherlock's shoulder and nuzzles the side of his face. ""I warned him it might be dangerous before inviting him here. He'll be okay. He was a Royal Marine, can hold his own.""



Sherlock nuzzles John, eyes closing as he relaxes. ""Mycroft will just have to get used to it when he babysits."" He teases.



John snorts, imagining Mycroft reasoning with a toddler than was half Holmes and half Watson. ""There's no hope for him, is there?"" he asks with a laugh.



Having eaten his first full meal in days, his stomach is less than thrilled with him. But John has enough time to put the dishes in the sink before he needs Sherlock. ""Bedroom?"" he says softly, rubbing his stomach, ""bit of nuzzling while I read more of mum's journal?""



Sherlock nods and finishes putting the leftovers away before following John up. ""You're starting to look better. Not so pale.""



""Helps to have you scent me. I can keep food down."" John nods, closing the bedroom door. ""Whoever I'm growing in here is going to be a handful."" He sighs happily then sprawls out on his parent's bed, pulling Sherlock with him. ""Let's see what mum has to say about birthing soulmate pups, shall well?""



He reads the entry aloud, the doctor in him able to appreciate the attention to detail his mother gave the entry. When he's done, he closes his eyes and places the book on his chest, and watches Sherlock as his Alpha showers his stomach with kisses. ""So, dad bit her again, during both births. I wonder if it was instinctual, or if they'd planned it.. she doesn't say.""



""Did he help her give birth?"" Sherlock asks, nuzzling and kissing John's belly. He decides John's jumper is just in the way so he strips John's top half completely so he has unhindered access to John's belly.



""She sounds like a doctor, John. The way she wrote everything down, the monitoring, weighing, temperatures. Every day. It was her log. Her research documents. I.."" He scents John. ""When I was out in the garden shed I found medicinal plants. Things you'd find in an apothecary or holistic medicine."" He hums. ""Did you and Harry ever get sick as pups?""



""Mmm the occasional stomach bug here and there, and Harry brought home lice once,"" John says thinking back, letting his mate manhandle his clothing off of him. ""But that was it, mainly. Why you think she found a way to keep us healthy?"" he asks, turning back to the book and leafing through the pages. 
Sure enough, towards the back, the book went from a journal to a log. Hand-drawn sketches of plants with descriptions written below them of their uses. He lets out a low whistle then shakes his head. ""I barely knew them...""



""I think maybe she was worried to take you to a doctor. A doctor who works for the government."" Sherlock says softly, in some of John's mother's letters she seemed wary of people in official roles.



""We went to the local GP a few times,"" John muses, ""but mainly just for the shots, we needed for school. I always thought it was because they didn't approve of all the tests they ran on omega children.""



John reaches down and strokes a hand through Sherlock's hair. After a moment his fingers tighten and he pulls Sherlock up for a kiss. When Sherlock finally settled on his side on the other half of the bed John rolled over and faced him.



""So many secrets, and while we've learned so much, I feel like we haven't made any forward progress. What's next? Do we go visit the couple my uncle mentioned? Or do we start digging into Jacobs Moriarty?""



""We'll leave Moriarty to Mycroft for now. I doubt we'd be able to get anything on him ourselves at the moment. We'll see if he ever purchased another omega."" Sherlock cuddles John close.



""We could but we also have to be careful because we know we're being watched so anyone we come into contact with could also be in danger. Like I said before omegas are the key. We need to look for an omega group willing to part with information. If not to both of us to you at least."" He rubs his face to John's neck.



""So,"" John sighs, feeling a bit defeated and overwhelmed, ""We need to find a walk to talk to the omegas, without being seen talking with them. Meanwhile we're sitting here, where everyone can see us. I don't want to leave for a safe house, and that also doesn't feel like our best option. Not when there is leg work to be done. We need someone who isn't watching us, who can interview people for us. And, if we can swing it, I think a secure online forum where people can anonymously reach out might be nice. Someone out there knows something we don't....""



John sighs and rolls onto his other side, pressing his back against Sherlock's chest and pulling Sherlock's arm over his chest. It was still too early to tuck in for the night, but he needed this, needed the closeness. Plus, Sherlock seemed to do his best thinking while scenting him. ""We need an outside man or woman..."" he says softly.



Sherlock holds John close, kissing his neck and back as he scents him. ""Someone with access to omegas but isn't threatening. Someone who wouldn't raise suspicions. Who had access to channels.."" He mumbles as he thinks.



""Anyone, you know of in your brother's office?"" John thinks aloud, not wanting to get up and ask Mycroft himself. Not when Sherlock was busy nuzzling against him.



""Mm since Mycroft got shot he's always used Anthea for leg work."" Sherlock mumbles. ""Oh! Anthea! She's perfect! She's a beta and female! She can slip in and out no problem. She's Mycroft's right hand so she's trained to the teeth.""



""Wait,"" John says, turning halfway around to face Sherlock, ""He got shot?""



""Mmhmm. Few years ago. I was in rehab and I escaped after I got word he was shot. He had a total knee replacement and uses the umbrella as a cane. That's why he doesn't do leg work anymore. Anthea isn't his assistant. He's her handler."" Sherlock hums.



""Huh,"" John says settling back down against the mattress. ""Can't picture him doing fieldwork. But.. yeah Anthea would work. Should we go ask your brother?""



""Probably since he and Anthea have been sleeping together."" Sherlock hums.



John snorts. The thought of Mycroft in bed with anyone somehow feels like asking the Queen to vacuum. He sits up and reaches for his shirt and pulls it over his head, wishing he had packed a robe or more clothes.



""Do you think we should return to Baker Street soon? It can't be cheap for Mycroft to be here, or for him to have his agents watch us this far out. Heading home might also give whoever is watching us the false assumption that we've stopped digging.""



He doesn't want to leave. Despite his earlier fears that coming back to his childhood home would stir up too many memories, it had been pleasant to be here. Plus, there was the incident on his childhood bed to forever make the trip worth it. But still, the home was too vulnerable to attack, and away from London, they were away from the support of friends and police they trusted.



""Don't worry about the money. Protection is written into Mycroft's contract and it extends to family. We're going to be monitored regardless of danger or not. I know you don't want to leave this place. We can take whatever you want with us."" Sherlock says softly.



""London is our  home,"" John's says after a few minutes. ""These walls hold memories, but not ours. I want our bed, our flat, and sounds that are familiar. Once we're sure there's nothing else hidden here, let's head home."" He looks over at his mother's blanket and smiles, ""and yeah, I'll take a few things with us.""



""I'll talk to Mycroft and we'll make plans to go home."" Sherlock nods.



""Hey,"" John grabs Sherlock's arm as he starts to walk away and pulls him close, ""I love you.""



He nuzzles his Mate a minute longer than picks up his mother's journal. ""I'll be taking a bath and reading if you need me. I'd like a glass of wine but...I guess I'll have to come up with something else to drink for the next nine months.""



""I love you, too."" Sherlock nuzzles John and scents. ""Grape juice? Sparkling grape juice?"" He suggests.



""Mm, could work."" John rummages through his case for his pyjamas and heads off to the master bathroom while Sherlock talks with his brother.



Meanwhile, John skims through his mother's journal, smiling at the detail and effort she put into it. She must have worked on it after they'd gone to bed, he couldn't remember ever seeing her write. 
Sherlock knocks on John's old bedroom door, hearing Mycroft inside.



Mycroft gets up and goes to the door, his phone to his ear. ""Can I help you, baby brother?"" He muses.



Sherlock looks at him and rolls his eyes. ""We need Anthea. Tell her to be here in the morning. We need to discuss the next steps.



""Why do they need me, My?"" Anthea says to Mycroft over the phone. She was holding down the home office while Mycroft was making sure Sherlock was safe. Mycroft had trained her to succeed him one day and takes over when he needs her to. She rather likes being in charge, bossing all the alphas around. 
Sherlock quickly explains what he and John had just discussed and braces himself for pushback from his brother. Instead, he gets a single nod, then Mycroft is barking orders into the phone. 
Once done he hangs up and turns back to Sherlock.



""John is right, London is safer if he's refusing a safe house. We both have eyes and ears everywhere in the City. And, as he said, if we play our cards right we can delude people into thinking you've given up. If only for a short time.""



Sherlock nods. ""John's mother was meticulous. She kept exact notes in everything, Mycroft. Every feeling and inclination. Her instincts were spot on. She knew when John and Harry were going to get sick even before they started showing signs of an illness."" He sighs. They don't have enough data and it's driving him nuts.



""When Anthea comes in the morning have her bring a blood draw kit for John and me as well. We need to see the changes in both parties. I think we should start sniffing around the legitimacies of some of these so-called matchmaking services. If anything they're fronts for omega trafficking."" He says and rolls his eyes when he sees the look on Mycroft's face. ""Yes, I know this is how things are done but they're still trafficking people to the highest bidders. It's a human rights violation and I don't care if the law doesn't recognize omega's as their own people."" He growls.



""I have to get back to John before he starts feeling sick again. Enjoy your dirty phone calls with Anthea."" He turns to go back to John. He's so wrapped up in making sure John is alright it doesn't occur to him that it's not a good idea to have Anthea come to them if they were going to use her for undercover work. It's a good thing it occurs to Mycroft.



John hears the bathroom door open but doesn't lookup. He can tell by the way the air crackles that it's Sherlock and not Mycroft invading his space.



He hears a soft rustle and looks up, expecting to see Sherlock removing his clothing. Instead, he watched as Sherlock sits with his back against the tub. He rolls one sleeve up and slings an arm over the edge, his long hands resting on his leg.



""So much here... But the more I read the more I realized that Mum was more interested in the moment. She seems happy documenting our lives while all of dad's papers have a more frantic feel to them. Like he wanted answers, and wasn't content just riding the wave.""



""Well if you're anything like him, which I'm sure you are, his protection instincts would have been off the charts. He wanted to keep you and Harry and your mum safe."" Sherlock hums softly, his brain quieter now that he's back with John.



""Yeah..."" John says noncommittally. Placing the book on the edge of the tub he skinks down into the water until just his nose is sticking out. It's quieter in the water. He'd begin to get used to the constant hum of Sherlock in his mind but the last few days had been difficult for both of them.



And now, with the pup, his head felt like someone was trying to push his brain through his ears from the inside out. 
Lifting his head enough so his mouth and ears were briefly above water he says gently, hoping not to offended Sherlock,



""She found a way to quiet the constant chatter of the bond. It's not permanent. But they used it when they needed to focus, for work or something like that.""



Sherlock takes the book and sets it on the counter, knowing John would be upset if it fell into the bath. ""Tell me how to do it."" He says, knowing he must be driving John round the bed with his mind constantly on. 
John opened one eye and surveyed his Mate for a long moment.



""It's like my switch during my heat. You just... Focus on it, will it to shut off. Which makes me wonder if there's more. Can we send thoughts, or the feelings that accompany those thoughts? Can we just tone down the chatter without turning it off completely?""



John thinks back to the time he had Sherlock handcuffed in the bathroom and shrugs, sending the water sloshing. ""When I was trying to show you how I can manipulate Alphas during my heat, it didn't really work on you. I thought maybe it was because it wasn't a full heat. But what if... What if it's because I didn't really want to seduce you. I had no need, you were already displaying signs of submitting to me. There was no aggression to ward off.""



""That's very possible."" Sherlock hums and rests his head back against the edge of the tub as he focuses his thoughts and on his connection to John.



Slowly he divides the thoughts he wants to be available to John and all the other ones that don't need to be passed along. Soon the constant hum through their connection lessens by half as Sherlock's only sending what's necessary to John. 
He smirks a bit and decides to test it out to see if he can focus on a single thought to send directly to John. 'I love you'



A warm shiver rushes over John's body even as his mind quiets. He lifts his head and looks down to see he's covered in goose pimples from head to toe.



""What.. what was that?"" He says, looking over at the back of his mate's head.



Sherlock chuckles softly and turns to look at John. ""I focused on a message.""



""Mmm,"" John says with a crooked smile ""love you too. Also... Thanks. I can think a bit easier now.""



""I'm sorry. I know it can be overwhelming. I can't imagine what it's like from the outside."" Sherlock says softly.



""It's fine normally,"" John says waving Sherlock's worry off. ""Just right now, trying to piece together a puzzle that's all the same colour, it's a bit much. You must be sick of how dull my thoughts are."" He laughs softly.



""They're.."" Sherlock tries to think of a way to describe it. ""They're like how coming home feels.""



""Home is full?"" John teases, leaning over and pressing a wet kiss to Sherlock's head. ""Did it work both ways? Or do I need to do something on my end as well?""



""Not full. Content and safe."" Sherlock nuzzles him. ""I don't think you need to do anything. If you want me to hear something specific you can try focusing on it.



""Mmm. What about..."" John says, sinking back down into the water. He focuses on what it felt like to have Sherlock inside him. The stretch and the fullness of it. He can feel himself growing aroused as he focuses on the memory of their last coupling.



Sherlock gasps and arches a bit, his cock filling out quickly as John's thoughts flood his mind. He plays dirty, sending back how good it felt to be inside John and have his cock wrapped in John's tight wet hot slick body.



""Bedroom, now,"" John says, already rising out of the water. He triggers the drain with his toe and steps out, dripping water onto Sherlock from above. Neither of them seems to care, however. John reaches for a towel and gives himself a quick pat-down so he doesn't get the bed soaking wet. He pauses for a brief moment, as he leaves the master bathroom and looks at his parent's bed. It's a bit weird, having sex on their bed, but his need is great enough that he doesn't give it a second thought.



""Should we warn your brother?"" John giggles, as he pulls Sherlock down on top of him, ""or let him find out the fun way?""



""The door is closed. If he comes in any mental scars are on him."" Sherlock snorts and kisses John deeply, wrapping his omega's legs around him.



""Oh, I was more concerned with the noise I'm about to make,"" John says with a laugh while twisting his body and flipping their positions. He ends up with his knees on either side of Sherlock's thighs and his hands planted firmly on Sherlock's chest. ""I'm going to have you first, then once I'm good and turned on you can bend me over and make me scream your name.""



Sherlock's thoughts are flooded with how hot it is when John takes charge and manhandles him. ""Is that so? Going to take what you want from me, omega?"" He smirks, teasing.



""Damn right I'll take what I want,"" John says, reaching behind him to gather some of his slick to use as lube. ""How's it feel, knowing my Omega slick is going to help me fuck you?"" he asks in a gravelly voice.



John grabs the underside of Sherlock's knee with his clean hand and pushes Sherlock's legs back until Sherlock's arse is exposed. Ignoring Sherlock's cock completely, he slides his slick fingers over Sherlock's hole then pushes in. He wiggles his fingers, getting his slick everywhere before pulling his hand back to reach for more slick. ""Look how hard you are at the thought of being fucked by me.""



""Not my fault. You're just so sexy and hot and you turn me on so much."" Sherlock whines, holding his legs up and open. ""I want you to fuck me. Need it. Want you inside me. It feels so good to claim your alpha, doesn't it?"" He groans, his cock throbbing as he feels John spread slick over him.



""So good."" John purrs, sliding the tip of his cock over Sherlock's hole, though he doesn't push in. Not yet. He knows Sherlock enjoys this just as much as he does, and wants to draw it out until his mate is begging for it.



""Tell me, Alpha,"" he growls, pushing his cock against Sherlock's hole with just enough pressure to remind Sherlock of what was about to come. ""Is it better with my slick? Dirtier knowing it's my body, out of heat, aiding me in fucking you? Tell me, or I won't push in, I'll just torment you like this.""



""Yes yes. Your slick is so good. So delicious. I want to taste every drip. Love it when you fuck me with it, feel your cock slid in and out of me which your slick coating me."" Sherlock whines a bit, trying to press down more against John's cock to get him inside.



John grabs both of Sherlock's legs and pulls them together. He guides Sherlock's legs to both sit on his right shoulder, then with a single push enters Sherlock. He knows how much his mate loves this. How he loves minimal preparation, and the feeling of John taking him in one push. Still, John holds himself still until Sherlock's breathing grows less frantic. When Sherlock wiggles once against him, he knows he's ready.



""So good for me,"" John purrs, not caring one bit about the volume of their voices. Mycroft can either sod off to the car for half an hour or ignore them. ""Look at you, getting fucked by your pregnant mate. If other Alphas found out..."" he growls while snapping his hips forward. He wraps both his arms around Sherlock's legs, holding them flush to his chest, and uses them for leverage. ""So god damn sexy...""



Sherlock presses a hand back against the headboard as the other grasps at the sheets. ""Oh fuck, John!"" He moans, head thrown back as his omega takes him.



""If they knew how fucking good it felt they drop trow and bend over. Oh fuck yes. There!"" He moans, maybe a bit louder than necessary to annoy Mycroft but John did feel so good and he wasn't going to hold back. He loves how John's cock fills him, as far as male omega cocks go John had a pretty sizable one but Sherlock loved how thick it was. He may be a bit of a size queen but he never knew it until he took John's cock.



""Oh? Pretty boy Alpha likes his prostate milked?"" John says slyly, pulling out then pressing in with a slow slide, relishing the way Sherlock's legs tightened on his shoulder as his cock milked every last drop of pleasure from Sherlock's body.



""John John John John!"" Sherlock's thighs trembling a bit. He loves this. Loves how John can take him apart so easily. He loves John so much he can't even think. ""Yours. I'm yours. Anything you want. Yours.""



John fucks Sherlock with a slow and steady pace. Enough to bring them both to the edge without tipping either of them over it. He watches as Sherlock's cock, trapped between his thighs, begins to leak until there is a pool of pre-come on Sherlock's stomach. When John feels as if he can't hold off his orgasm any longer he pulls out with a wet pop and releases Sherlock's legs.



""Fuck me and make me come, Alpha,"" he demands while flipping over onto his hands and knees. He yelps a bit as Sherlock grabs his hips and flips him onto his back, but purrs happily as Sherlock nuzzles along his neck. This is better, facing each other. He loves the way Sherlock watches him when they're like this.



Sherlock holds John close, nuzzling and kissing over John's bite as he presses his cock into John. He nibbles and sucks on it teasingly as he rolls his hips, letting the desire for one another build.



""You like fucking me, don't you? Feeling like you have the power. That you're in charge. Pushing your omega cock in your alpha. Making me squirm and be for more."" He teasingly snaps his hips. ""But you're mine. All mine. To do with as I please. You do the same to me."" He presses deeper.



""All mine,"" John growls back, reaching a hand down and grabbing a fistful of Sherlock's arse. He wishes his reach was a bit longer so he could stick a finger inside Sherlock, but Sherlock's torso is longer than his, and his arse hole is just out of reach. So he settles for leaving bruises with his fingertips along his mate's hips and cheeks. ""I could flip you over right now and finish this, with my cock buried deep inside you. And you wouldn't stop me, you love it too much.""



""Mm, I'll fill you first, and then you can go back to fucking me however you like while my come leaks out of you."" Sherlock nips at John's lips as he rolls his hips, rubbing John's prostate endlessly.



John closes his eyes and lets his Alpha give into his natural instincts. He loves their power play, loves seeing his cock inside his Alpha, but most of all he loves this. Loves Sherlock taking care of him, even while pretending to be big and tough. John tilts his neck, presenting his bite. But as time passes, and he can feel both of their climax approaching, and Sherlock doesn't bite him, John lets out a frustrated groan.



Taking Sherlock's head in both hands he forces Sherlock's neck to the side while pulling him close to his mouth. His teeth sink into Sherlock's scent gland, he can feel his teeth filling the same indents and it's like sinking your fingers into memory foam. There's no blood or fluid, just... emotion and want. He can feel Sherlock's core like this, the things that make his Alpha tick. It's like looking at the inside of a clock and seeing the gears move, but not knowing what role each notch plays.



It's all he needs. His shout is muffled by Sherlock's neck, but he doesn't dare release his Alpha. Somehow, this feels right, to be connected like this to the man who'd impregnated him outside of a heat. His fingers dig into Sherlock's neck, and he realizes they must hurt but Sherlock doesn't pull away, and there's no discomfort coming across their bond. Thrusting his hips up once, allowing his cock to slide across Sherlock's stomach, he comes hard, and only releases Sherlock's neck when he fears his tremors might cause his teeth to rip flesh.



Sherlock can't help it. As soon as he feels John bite him he's coming and filling his omega. All thoughts leave his head, leaving him blank and everything quiet. There's only two things he can register, one being John's teeth on his skin and his cock pumping cum into John's body.



""Ahh so good,"" John purrs, licking Sherlock's neck as his Alpha fills him. ""So good, love.""



He holds Sherlock close, until their bodies stop shaking, then presses kisses along Sherlock's jawline.



""Every time we do this, I feel closer to you. I don't mean sex... I mean... biting,"" he says softly while running his fingers through the hair at the nape of Sherlock's head.



Sherlock nuzzles and kisses John's chest, his brain trying to remember words and how to speak without much luck so he just holds John close as he presses kisses to his skin.



Eventually, he can remember how talking works. ""You're perfect."" He mumbles softly.



""So are you,"" John says, reaching for the towel he'd (thankfully) brought with him. He cleans them both off then snuggles close. ""I wasn't too rough?"" he asks, knowing that Sherlock's body (like a male Beta) didn't take a cock quite as easily as his did. He always asked, wanting to make sure that his mate was okay with their power struggle.



""No. You were perfect. Your cock was perfect. You fucking me was perfect."" Sherlock curls up around John's belly, scenting and nuzzling it.



""Mmm good,"" John says happily, enjoying Sherlock's aftercare. ""I love being called your omega during sex."" He admits, letting his fingers dance across Sherlock's head. ""It's worth being an Omega if I get to be yours.""



""I'll make sure to call you my omega during sex then."" Sherlock presses kisses to John's belly. ""I don't know how your dad got anything done when your mum was pregnant. I can't even consider you being out of my line of sight let alone working or any other separate activity.""



""Excuses, excuses,"" John purrs, though he laughs as Sherlock nuzzles his head down into his stomach. ""Oi, don't squash the baby... He's still cooking in there.""



""At this point it's microscopic and it'll be cooking for quite some time,"" Sherlock mumbles against John's skin.



""Mmm,"" John says sleepily. ""Too early for bed?"" he asks, not knowing the actual time. It had to be close to eight, if not a little after. Early, by their standards, but his eyes were tired from reading all day.



""No. Your body is creating a person from basically nothing. Sleep is good."" Sherlock pulls the covers up around him. He lays behind John and presses against John's back, his hand resting protectively over his belly.



As he drifts off, John is hit by the fact that he's carrying a pup. Not just any pup, but their pup. He snuggles back against his mate and tries not to worry about how much baby-proofing Baker Street needs, or over the fact that they hardly had space for a crib or playpen in the living room. They'd make it work, he knew that, still, it was daunting to think about all the work they'd need to do before the baby was born. Worse yet, knowing that their preparations would be nothing compared to the actual work of raising a human being.



""Hush, everything will be fine."" Sherlock soothes, kissing John's head and sending calming feelings through their connection.



""Out of my head,"" John says weakly, though he doesn't mean it. Sherlock chuckles and the waves of calming energy he sends allows John to clear his mind and drift off.


These two just want to have sex non stop. How dare they, we have a story to tell here! -Tindo


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


Anthea looks up from the computer as Mycroft comes in, she had been alerted he left John's family home and had been waiting for him to show up ever since. ""Didn't expect you till the morning."" She hums.



""They were loudly expressing their mutual desire for physical gratification,"" Mycroft sighs, pulling his tie off and sinking into an armchair in Anthea's hotel room. ""Thin walls.""



""Shall I get you a drink to numb the pain?"" Anthea laughs softly, finishing off a report before sending it and closing her laptop.



""There is another way to banish the echoes of their... desire,"" Mycroft says, looking up with a single eyebrow raised. ""If you're willing.""



""With you? I'm pretty much always willing."" Anthea gets up and walks over to him, hips swaying. ""Here or in bed?""



""Anywhere you'd like, Sir"" rings in Mycroft's head, her first words to him when they'd first entered into this little arrangement. ""What do you want,"" he asks softly. His brother's constant worry for pleasing John had gotten into his head, and for once he wanted Anthea to have whatever it was she wanted.



""Oh don't you dare go and get soft one me now,"" Anthea smirks and straddles Mycroft's lap, her skirt riding up her thighs. ""I want you. And you're so good at giving me what I want."" She noses along his jaw.



Mycroft eyes her for a moment then gives a single nod. He stands, wrapping his arms around her back and taking her with him. He knew her, and her tastes. She'd want it rough and fast. He walks to the bed then drops her unceremoniously onto the mattress.



""Strip,"" he says, pulling off his already loose tie and tossing it onto the bed beside her, ""then cover your eyes with that.""



He leaves his clothes on, only undoing his belt and opening his zip. His cock grows hard, watching her scramble to take her clothes off. When she reaches for her nylons he stops her with a growl. ""Leave them,"" he says, then hums appreciatively when she doesn't question it. When she lays before him, his tie over her eyes dressed only in her panties and nylons, he grabs her legs and pulls her to the edge of the bed. 
Grabbing the sheer fabric between her legs he yanks, filling the room with a tearing sound. He knows he'll have to buy her a new pair, but the cost is worth it when he sees her shudder. Slipping aside her panties he lines himself up and slips into her warmth with a growl.



Anthea moans, her body arched off the bed as she takes every hard inch of him. She loved when he took her like this, loving how in control he was. How he knew exactly how to give her what she wanted. She knew it was like a game for him, playing with her body to see what made her shake and shiver.



""So hard for me."" She purrs, feeling him stretch her deep.



""Quite,"" He hisses, ""Or I'll rip your panties off and stuff them in your mouth.""



He sees her smirk, and wonders just how long it will be until she tests that claim.



Anthea licks her lips and instead of talking, she squeezes around his cock, massaging him from the inside.



Mycroft played Anthea like Sherlock could play his violin. It never ceased to amaze him how slick her entrance was for him every time. They'd never required lube, save for the one time he'd tried letting her top and she just wasn't having it.



When they both collapsed and spent, he indulged in a few moments of cuddling, understanding why his brother had embraced the seemingly pointless act with open arms.



""Thank you... I assure you that was not the reason I called you up here.""



""Oh? Well maybe that was the reason why I came."" Anthea teases, a little giggle passing her lips as she enjoys the cuddling. She rubs her fingertips over his arm, memorizing his freckles. ""Besides, we both know you think better after you fuck me through the mattress. Or over your desk. Or that one time when the elevator cameras weren't working."" She smirks.



They had been working together for ages. Mycroft handpicked her out of training because she was the most skilled of her class as well as the most trainable. She'd been his assistant at the start, his point of contact when he was out on missions. After he got shot she was the first at the hospital before he was even out of surgery and she stayed until he was discharged. She was the one who took him to rehab and even slept on his couch until he was able to manage by himself. She may be submissive towards him during sex because they both like it but that doesn't mean she's not a highly trained cold-blooded killer like he is.



""Right... To business then."" Mycroft says. The sweat on his skin and the cool air cause goose pimples on his skin.



Still letting Anthea trace shapes on his skin he lays out his needs then turns to her.



""Fieldwork... If you're willing. Step up from desk work.""



""Ooo letting me off my leash?"" Anthea smirks, her chin resting on his chin as she looks up at him.



""If a leash is what you've been on, then yes,"" Mycroft says, observing her with a keen eye. ""If you find it to your liking, we can discuss future missions, though I would be lost without you in the office.""



""Of course I'm willing. I'll look into groups and see where I can slip in. Being a beta has its advantages.""



She rubs her cheek against Mycroft's chest but stops herself. She knows if she enjoys this too much she'll give everything away. ""I'll do some undercover and recon. And I'll personally sweep the flat before they go back."" She says softly, knowing Mycroft feels better when she double checks everything the lackeys do.



""Mmm, and assign a team to create a secure website. We need a chat room, of sorts where people like my brother and relay information to us. As much as it pains me to say this, I don't even want to know who they are. If we know, there is a chance we could risk their safety. If you must create a database of names and addresses, encrypt it, and break the information up across multiple servers. Meanwhile, I need to return to London and look into Moriarty. Something tells me we're about to start hearing that name frequently.""



Mycroft sits up and reaches for the phone that will connect them with the front desk. He orders room service for both of them, then settles back against the bed to wait. ""No one followed you here?"" He asks, even though he already knows the answer. Still, he figures it wouldn't be unkind to show a bit of compassion.



""I'll have the Quartermasters start setting it up. We'll have to have some kind of verification to make sure they're legitimate. A questionnaire or something."" Anthea hums, biting the inside of her cheek.



""Of course I wasn't. But my flat is being watched which I don't appreciate."" She rolls her eyes. ""What I can't figure out is why is a Russian hitman sitting down the street from my flat drinking espresso and trying to tap my phones."" She says sarcastically and snorts.



""Espresso is far superior to a normal brew... and I hear your phone calls can be quite steamy"" Mycroft says smugly and smiles as her giggles vibrate across his chest. In a more serious tone, he sighs, and brushes a strand of hair out of her eyes, ""I'm afraid my brother unwittingly stumbled upon something quite dangerous. I overheard them talking, John's father was murdered, most likely over this.""



""Mm, next time I'll add you to the line to listen in."" Anthea teases. 
She frowns and nods. ""I'll see if there's an autopsy or anything on his father or any other documentation. Moriarty.. that sounds familiar. I can't remember why."" She gets up, walking over to her laptop naked and if she felt Mycroft's cum leaking between her legs she didn't seem to mind.



""Any information would be helpful. I don't want to tell John I'm looking into things. Not sure if he'd take it well, but perhaps if we find something, I can lead Sherlock in the right direction.""



Mycroft runs his hair through his hair and grimaces. He estimates they have seventeen minutes before room service arrives. With Anthea on the hunt once more, he has time for a shower. ""Call if you need me,"" he says, heading towards the bathroom.



Anthea joins him five minutes later. ""Jacob Moriarty was investigated some twenty years ago for a string of his omega's dying under mysterious circumstances. But since they were under his responsibility he denied autopsies and buried them in unmarked graves on his estate. We can't get an aerial view of the estate because there's interference going out to a five-kilometer radius around the parameter and above in the sky.""



""He was negotiating a contract to buy John's mother before she presented."" Mycroft muses, relaxing as Anthea snakes her arms around his waist. ""I've already looked, there aren't any copies of the documents, save one. The one where he forfeited his right to her as long as the parents returned the deposit, which they did not do. Though he never went after them.""



Wiping water from his face he turns and cocks his head at the petite woman sharing his shower with him. ""That doesn't seem likely for a businessman, does it? Leaving unclaimed money lying about?""



Anthea frowns and shakes her head. ""It doesn't. But all businessmen know how to get their payment. Maybe he got what he wanted without getting his money back..""



""Unlikely, but a possibility,"" Mycroft muses, ""Worth looking into at least. I have a theory, but it is too early in the game to extrapolate...""



Mycroft steps out of the shower, leaving Anthea to wash up. Toweling off he puts on his pants, trousers, and undershirt, then heads to the door. He opens it just as the waitstaff is reaching up to knock. Tipping the man, he accepts the food and places it on a small table.



""I'll return to London the day after tomorrow,"" he says loud enough for Anthea to hear, but not loud enough to be overheard should anyone be lingering in the hallway. ""Sherlock and his growing family aren't safe until this is resolved.""



Anthea comes out, drying off her hair. ""I'll never get used to how much you cum. It's like buckets."" She hums, pulling on a bra and panty set. ""Had to use the detachable shower head for almost five minutes to rinse it all out."" She nearly purrs but holds it back.



""I'll head out in the morning and make preparations. I.."" She stops thinking. ""I think we've been looking at this the wrong way.""



Mycroft's face begins to turn red at her comment, but as she continues he gives her a puzzled look.



""What do you mean?""



""If we think John's father was murdered then he's probably not the first nor the last. We have to look into alphas who died suddenly or under mysterious circumstances leaving an omega behind. It makes them vulnerable and targets. I'll get a report together and see if anything pops."" Anthea hums and comes over to the cart. ""What did you get?""



""You only nuzzle my face when you're craving something sweet,"" Mycroft says, lifting the cover off the tray, revealing a tray full of Petit Four.



""You know when you're good to me it makes me want to suck you off."" Anthea grins, licking her lips as she looks at her treat.



""Perhaps that was my motivation,"" Mycroft says with a wink, pinching a sweet from the tray.



""Mm, you should have gotten a can of whipped cream sent up as well. I would have licked it off."" Anthea smirks and takes her plate to the table.



""Lick? Mycroft asks warily, ""You mean bite. Or do you think I've forgotten the last time we tried?""



""You like when I nibble. Just not your cock."" Anthea laughs and eats.


Tindo here, trying to write a Mycroft we don't hate. So far so good.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          



His feet pound across hard dirt. Everywhere around him shadows seem to jump at him. The forest is dense. Damp earth and decaying leaves permeate his senses. He can hear them now, not just sense them. Footsteps behind him. Two, maybe three sets of feet crashing through the trees behind him. Not at all far behind. They'll catch up soon if he doesn't find a way out of here. He doesn't dare turn around, afraid that he'll stumble on a branch or root in the dark.





He runs, thinking of his children, his wife. Knowing they're waiting for him back home. They're probably sitting down for dinner even now, asking where Dad is. Their essence gives him a burst of speed and he flies through the forest as quick as his feet can safely take him.





He breaks free of the trees, and finds himself on a road, and nearly runs into his car which is parked just where he left it. Fishing his keys from his pocket he fumbles and nearly drops them. But even as the feet grow closer, he wrenches the door open and slides in, locking himself safely inside the car. He doesn't pause to see the faces of his pursuers. Who they are doesn't matter, just who sent them. And he already knows that. With shaking fingers he pushes the key into the ignition and turns it. The car roars to life, and an instant later a searing heat envelopes him. As the car burns, with him inside, he sees the faces of his children and prays that they'll be safe.




A scream tears its way from John's throat as he sits up. It takes him a moment to piece together where he is through the panic and tears in his eyes. A gentle hand presses itself against John's back as he begins to sob. He sits there, shaking, eyes burning with the image of his father's car blowing to pieces with him still inside it. While the logical side of his brain knows, regardless of method, his father died in hospital, it was still terrifying to see in such crystal clear imagery.



""It's alright, John. Just breathe. I'm right here."" Sherlock rubs his back gently and sends soothing calmness over their connection.



Gasping in huge gulps of air John curls into Sherlock, pressing his face into Sherlock's chest. In a broken voice, he explains the dream. By the time he's done his fingers are digging into Sherlock's shoulder in a way that must be painful, but his Alpha just holds him close. ""It, god it was so real. I could smell the accelerant used to feed the explosion.""



""I'm so sorry, John."" Sherlock kisses his head and holds him tight, scenting his mate heavily.



""Sherlock... make love to me,"" John says weakly, wanting to feel anything other than the wrung-out emotions his dream had left him with. ""Bite me, love me, make me feel better? Please?""



Sherlock nods and kisses John, rolling him onto his back. He teases John, getting him slick before he slides into his mate's body. He holds him close and rocks his hips deep and slow. ""You're here. You're safe. Our pup is safe. I'll keep you safe. I promise."" He rocks, licking and sucking on their bond mark.



For the first time, John lays still, leaving Sherlock to wipe away all traces of his nightmare. His mate showers him with kisses. On his neck, his jaw, his lips, even nibbling his ear a few times making John shudder. This closeness is what John needed, and Sherlock gives it to him willingly. It's slow, and perfect. John's hands ghost over Sherlock's back, and when Sherlock's teeth sink into his neck he sighs and comes in tiny droplets of come that drip from his cock onto his stomach. It's a far cry from their normal coupling, but as Sherlock rocks one last time into him, John kisses Sherlock's ear and whispers, ""Thank you.""



""Anything for you."" Sherlock holds him close, not moving away or pulling out.



""Not sure I can sleep,"" John says, turning his head to look at the clock, which read three am. ""Will I keep you up if I turn a light on and read?""



""You know I don't sleep much anyway."" Sherlock nuzzles his neck, licking the bite.



""Good, you can stay up with the pup when he wakes up at 2 am."" John says, trying to smile, but he's too shaken to put much effort into it.



""I'll take it."" Sherlock kisses John softly. ""We can make a nest and have some snacks and watch a movie?""



""How about... we make a nest and you tell me your hopes for our child?"" John says instead, ""Or tell me about your childhood. Something soft and sweet.""



""Alright."" Sherlock smiles softly. ""I'll get some blankets and pillows from the cabinet. Then I can tell you about grandmama and how we'd sneak away from parties to eat ice cream in the village.""



John nods and shifts on the bed to make room for additional bedding. When Sherlock comes back he helps his mate create a nest, then curls up with his back pressed against the wall of blankets. With a hand over his stomach, as if protecting the pup from unseen forces, he waits for Sherlock to settle in beside him. Their knees touch and John reaches out and takes Sherlock's hand, pressing it against his stomach and holding it there.



""It isn't just us now. I've been happy to rush into dangerous situations, blind to what might happen to me. But I can't do that anymore, can I?""



""No. Not anymore. Neither of us can."" Sherlock rubs John's hip. ""We have adult responsibilities now."" He teases gently.



They talk and cuddle in their nest until Sherlock's voice soothes John back to sleep. His dreams are less intense but drift from uneasy to forgettable.



Sherlock stays awake, scenting John and keeps John's bad dreams away as much as he can. He rubs John's belly gently, needing some kind of connection to their pup. He keeps his racing thoughts to himself so as not to disturb John. He has multiple theories running through his head but he needs more data to make a solid story. 


Short chapter is short. It was just a good place to break up the big block of text we have. Sometimes they pan out to be longer chapters, others end up short like this guy.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

When they finally leave John's parents' house they pack all the notes and books and everything from the house they may need or don't want to leave behind. They're driven by one of Mycroft's minions at first to Sherlock's annoyance but then it gives him more time to cuddle John and rub his belly.

When they arrive back at Baker Street he notices things have been moved and touched, no doubt the flat and whole building having been swept through multiple times by Mycroft's agents if not Mycroft himself.

Sherlock helps John organize all their findings. He starts to make a timeline of events through John's parent's letters and notes, thankful for John's mother's meticulous note keeping and journals. He likes reading about what John was like when he was younger and how he changed as he grew from a pup to a toddler to a small child.

He ignores Lestrade's calls for cases as they already have a case and they're supposed to be keeping a low profile. He and John argue whether or not they should take a case because they're supposed to be looking like they've given up on the whole soulmate case.

Sherlock caves rather quickly, not wanting to see his omega upset, and decides to take a small case just to make a show of being out as if they've given up on what happened at John's house.

Meanwhile, Anthea works tirelessly to get the secure omega site open and completely encrypted. She works closely with some other colleagues as well as interviews as many omega's and omega groups as she can.

Three days after Sherlock and John have come home to Baker Street Anthea has thick files of data for them to go through. She also has autopsy reports of every mysterious, sudden, or unexplained alpha death that left a widowed omega going back before John and Sherlock were even born.

John stands staring at the wall behind the sofa. He has one hand in his hair and the other on his stomach, absently rubbing small circles through his shirt. Sherlock is hunched over a laptop, he thinks.

Something has been bothering John but until now he hadn't been able to put a finger on it. But with the timeline completely he can see it now.

""Moriarty. That word, or name, keeps popping up. It's safe to assume it's a name, as there's always the initial J before it, like Jacobs Moriarty.""

He turns to make sure Sherlock is listening.

""What if it's a family of J Moriarty. It can't be the same person. This stretches back years before us. But how does that help? What is this, a sick and twisted family business? *Saving* Omegas after their mates die?""

""Maybe Jacobshad a child with one of his omega's and passed down the family business."" Sherlock hums.

""Forced breeding... Then take the child from the omega more likely."" John growls deep in his chest.

Sherlock gets up and goes to John, pressing against his back. ""It's alright. We'll solve this so no one has to endure it again.""

""Mmm,"" John says leaning back against his mate. ""Before I start showing would be nice... Can't imagine chasing after you once my center of gravity shifts""

""I would like to have everything settled and wrapped up before you give birth. Court and sentencing include."" Sherlock scents John, resting his hand on his belly.

""How long can I go before you push me into making my first appointment?""

""Considering I've already made one for you for tomorrow afternoon at a private secure clinic I'd say a little over twenty-seven hours."" Sherlock kisses John's neck, he had noticed John's scent changing again and it concerned him.

""Mmm, I'm busy tomorrow."" John wrinkles his nose but there's no real heat in his words.

He looks at the timeline and groans. ""All I see is a line of omegas losing their mates, then half of them, the younger ones, go missing before they have a chance to get over their grieving period.""

""Don't worry. I know a good detective to track you down."" Sherlock chuckles softly.

He hums softly, his mind turning over John's words. ""Grieving period.. grieving period... Grieving period!"" He says suddenly, going back to a stack of papers.

""What?"" John asks, watching Sherlock search frantically through the mess. ""What did I miss?""

""Paperwork. It's always the bloody paperwork."" Sherlock finds a pattern. ""From the time an alpha does until the omega because the responsibility of the closest related alpha is three days. It takes time for the paperwork to get processed after the death and the legal requirements to transfer to the closest alpha. All the omega's go missing within those three days. Those three days when the omega's are completely alone and unprotected legally and probably otherwise as well.""

""What does this mean, Sherlock?"" John gets an uneasy feeling in his gut as he watches his mate. ""So they're kidnapped? They don't just... Go off and kill themselves from grief?""

Sherlock shakes his. ""No. No, I don't think so. And since they're not allowed to be basically anything without an alpha's approval they couldn't do anything for themselves. I think they were taken..""

""Are we looking at two cases here? Or... is this all connected?""

John sits and runs a hand through his hair. It wasn't unheard of for Omegas to go missing, but there was an unspoken rule that after an Alpha passed, they would be given a short time to grieve while the government worked out who's family would take over legal rights.

""Is Moriarty involved in any of those Omega's lives, before they bonded? Are they soulmates? I'm so sick of finding more questions than answers.""

""I.."" Sherlock thinks. He's careful of what he tells John, knowing John is already stressed and doesn't want that to hurt his mate or their pup.

""Out with it,"" John says, getting up and heading into their kitchen. ""I know that look, and you think better talking out loud. I'll make tea. There's almost nothing tea can't cure.""

""I think there's an underground omega trafficking ring that gets their supply of omega's from killing their alpha and then kidnapping the omega to sell to the highest bidder."" Sherlock frowns.

""But why go through all the trouble?"" John starts to say. But as he places the teabags, decaf for him, into a cup he starts to understand, ""Because no one will go looking for them. Not under those circumstances...""

""Exactly unless the family really wanted to maintain control over the omega then they would be taken right away into the next alphas custody."" Sherlock frowns.

""What were the cabbies' words, before he died? His exact wording... He said he had a sponsor?"" John asks, bringing Sherlock his tea and settling into his chair, his mother's blanket now draped over the back replacing the old afghan. ""So, like a AA sponsor? Someone who... what? Encouraged him to murder? Then he dropped Moriarty's name. Murder isn't a far cry from trafficking."" John blows on his tea then takes a sip, mulling over the idea in his head. ""We need to find out more about this Jacobs Moriarty.""

""Maybe he helped murder the alphas and then drove the omega's to wherever they needed to go."" Sherlock hums.

John watched Sherlock work until the sun had long set. He ate dinner alone, though he managed to coax Sherlock into a few bites while Sherlock laid on the couch, his head nuzzling John's stomach, helping ward off the queasy feeling John still got when he ate. When he couldn't keep his eyes open any longer, he kissed the back of Sherlock's head and padded off to the bedroom. Sherlock joined him sometime after 1am, and wrapped his arms around John's back, muttering about Moriarty and how he must have another man who could grab the Omegas unseen.

He managed to get himself so absorbed in the book that he could finally stop thinking about him. He was halfway through the book when his perfect evening was interrupted by someone knocking on his door.

His first thought out of habit was the new case. But there were no cases anymore. He'd stopped taking cases from the police since the event of the rift. Not when there was no more Sherlock Holmes to work for. And now his thought circled back to him again. Great.

He was about to ignore them and pretend no one home if not for the person's annoyingly insistent knocking. He got up from the couch and went to the door with a groan.  

John was not prepared when Sherlock's older daughter was staring at him at the door. He hadn't seen her for the entire month after the rift. After that dinner.

""What do you want from us?"" She demanded from the doorstep. John frowned, confused.

""You've just knocked on my door and asked me what I want. I think that's my line.""

""I went to pay my rent today and Mrs. Hudson said it was already paid. I can't think of anyone else. So tell me, what do you want in return?""

John sighed and stepped aside, opening his door for her. ""Come in.""

He led her deep into the house, to the living room, and motioned her to sit on the armchair. He went about and came back to put some wood in the fireplace. The crackling sound felt satisfying to his ear. He set himself comfortably on the couch again. All the while he could feel the girl's eyes on him the whole time.

""Watson!"" Bea finally spoke. ""What do you want from us?""

""Do I look like someone who needs your help now?""

""But you paid for our rent."" She suddenly seemed uncertain. ""You paid our rent, didn't you?""   

""Yes. But I don't want anything from you.""

""Then why?""

John shrugged. ""You deserve it.""

When Bea just stared at him with a skeptical look in her eyes John sighed. ""Look, I know I've not been... treating you very well. But you knew there were urgent matters happening at the time so we didn't actually have time to... talk.""

""So you want to talk?""

""Only if you want to.""

""About what?""

""Anything.""

She was silent for a while. John was waiting for her to speak. The crackling sound from the fireplace was absolutely soothing.

""Can I ask you something about him then?"" Bea said carefully. John took a deep breath. But after everything, she definitely deserved it. So he nodded.

""For all those years, did he ever mention...?"" She swallowed and licked her lip, clearly anxious about the topic. ""When you first recruited us... Did he know?""

""Did you actually think he would care?"" The power the question held hung heavily in the air after he'd said it. It weighed down both of their heart. John knew from the look in Bea's eyes that the girl was hurt by the sheer fact. And John regretted saying it instantly. Regretted causing her more pain after all they had been through.

John wouldn't blame him. Sherlock was deep in his own misery to be able to care for anyone, not even himself. He knew of the utter incapacity of himself to take care of his children so he gave them away, trusting in the hands of the betters.

However, John did not mean that he was happy with what Sherlock chose to do with his daughters. John was willing to raise them with him and provide all the help he could give only if Sherlock would let him. Only if Sherlock could just see him. That he was there with him when Alice was gone. Had always been there through thick and thin with him from the very beginning. And would continue to be there for him for the rest of the time. Only if he could just see that.

No matter how willing John was to keep the children, he had no say to that. Sherlock was the father. John was just his business partner, his friend, nothing more.

""Are you saying that you care, Watson?"" Bea's voice pulled him to the present. She was watching him with the judging eyes, always so doubtful, always not so easily trusting.

John couldn't help a little smirk. ""What do you think?""

Bea studied his face fiercely before giving the answer. ""The information still not sufficient. I'll need to gather more in order to conclude.""

John could only cocked his head to that. What more could he say? It wasn't like he would outright admit that so easily.

""Well,"" Bea continued. ""Sorry that it's a bit hard to believe that you care, you know."" She didn't look at him anymore. Her eyes flicked to the fire in the hearth. ""When you seemed to know how difficult our lives were, how hard we were struggling to live. How hard finding a roof over our heads.""

""Who do you think recommended Mrs. Hudson's cellar to you?""

She looked back at him instantly and then frowned. ""It was a boy I once worked with at one job.""

""Who do you think told that boy to tell you of that place? And did you really think Mrs. Hudson would let a group of street kids with barely enough money for a month rent the place without question?""

Bea's eyes were wide in surprise. ""Have you been stalking us?""

""No."" John leaned back against the back of the couch. ""We - Sherlock and I - had a group of street kids we occasionally used to gain information from the places -""

""That's not suitable for the people like you,"" Bea interrupted.

""Not only that."" John continued. ""Nothing paranormal or supernatural regarding the use of these kids. Just plain information. You wouldn't believe how fast news spread among the streets -""

""I wouldn't believe?"" Bea was looking at him. Unbelievable, she said through her facial expression. John glared warningly at her to shut up. Then he continued.

""His own personal network as he called it. That's why I was able to find you even when you were constantly moving from place to place.""

""Have you been stalking us?"" Bea asked again. Seriously, couldn't she just believe what he said for once?

John looked her dead in the eyes. ""I was... looking out for you. Just checking on you from time to time. Not stalking you. Especially after seeing that you'd found your own family.""

""I've done marvelously without any parents, don't you think?"" She must have wanted it to come out as sarcastic. But her tone of voice lacked the intent.

So John just simply answered. ""Yes, you have. But you would do better with one.""

John could not believe himself that he was doing this. All he thought was that the apartment was so quiet when living alone. He had never been alone since he'd moved in with Sherlock.

For once in this night, Bea was speechless. She was looking at him with a lot of questions dancing in her eyes, thinking, calculating, doubting. Then there was a flicker of hope. And then fear. And then understanding. And at last, the determination.

""I don't think that you actually want this, Watson. I don't think you really want us to be your family. I think you are just lonely.""

Now she'd just rendered him speechless. Like a slap in the face. A bucket of freezing water over his head. John swiftly got up from his seat. Suddenly needed a drink.

""I don't want you to be my family either."" Bea's voice stopped him as he was about to walk across the room. He turned to her. ""I've already had my own family. The people I grew up with. But we can be your friends."" She paused. John felt his throat tightened. ""Did you actually mean it when you said to me earlier that you're not going anywhere?""

John held her gaze, swallowing the lump in his throat before he could breathe the words out. ""Yes, I meant it.""

To his astonishment, Bea smiled at him. The real smile. The kind that made her eyes wrinkle.

""Then I'll be there for you, too, Watson. You don't have to be alone. We all will be there. As your friends.""

John couldn't help forming a smile that matched with hers. And then a smile turned into a chuckle when a flash of old memories rushing to his mind.

""What?"" Bea demanded.

He ducked his face and shook his head a little. ""It was just... He used to say this to me once.

Sherlock's voice ringing in his mind. 'You don't have to be alone, John. Why don't you move in with me? Besides, we will work the cases better if we live together. What do you think, John?'

""We are not him."" Bea's voice again pulled John to the present. ""We will be better friends than him."" She said with a smile so wide, clearly joking.

""I don't know."" John crossed his arms. ""We've been friends for just a day -""

""More like ten minutes.""

""Right. Ten minutes. How can I compare? Wait for five years and we will see.""

She chuckled but with a look in her eyes telling him that she'd accepted the challenge.

She rose from her seat and walked over to him.

""May I ask you for one more thing?"" She asked. And after he nodded she continued. ""No more talk about himfrom now on. I don't want you to end up like him, living in deep sorrow, sinking in grief.

""Being friends for ten minutes and you tell me what to do already?""

""I've just realised it was a bad idea asking about him. Also, I don't think that Jessie will want anything to do with him.""

""I can see why.""

""Should I put on a sign that says 'In this house, we don't talk about Sherlock Holmes' to remind you not to?""

He huffed a laugh. ""I don't think that will be helpful.""

Bea giggled.

""What about you, are you alright?"" John sincerely wanted to know. The last time they met, she was more than broken. But judging by the way her eyes brightened and her smile wider than he had ever seen. Her problem most likely was already gone. Which meant...

""Leo is back and he won't have to marry the princess anymore. I don't know how he did it. And I don't say that he won't one day get married ever. But this is... We will have more time to treasure together."" 

John smiled just for how happy she was. ""Great. I thought we had to put on a sign that says 'In this house, we don't talk about Prince Leopold', as well.""

This time she laughed.

""Ah... Nice touch,"" John smirked, looking his lover over and stroking the curve of Sherlock's bare arse as the detective draped himself across his lap. The fluffy, bunny-tail lingerie - complete with fluffy, white ears - was already playing at his arousal and he knew he wouldn't be able to resist the temptation much longer. ""The carrot, that is... Although, the tail definitely adds something to it.""


 


Sherlock's back arched teasingly, curving up into the calloused fingers of John's left hand, as he let out a hum of amusement. ""Mmm, yes... I'd hoped you'd like that,"" he answered, his icy eyes alight with mischief. ""Carrots are good for your eyes, after all... but, you already knew that, didn't you, Doctor?""


 


A light chuckle rumbled up from John's chest as his eyes raked over the man in his lap once again. He slid a finger beneath the blue silk strap that accentuated the lift of Sherlock's arse and licked his lips thoughtfully, pulling back on the elastic strap before letting it go with a harsh snap. The sound sent a bolt of desire straight through to his groin and his smirk only grew. ""True... I did know that, love,"" he replied, his thoughts drifting further and further away from the religious purity usually associated with the upcoming holiday. ""I believe I heard someone say that they were good for your arse, as well.""


 


The quirk of a perfectly manicured eyebrow signaled intrigue on Sherlock's part, but he tried his best not to let it show. ""Ah, did you, now?""


 


""Indeed, I did... Want to find out if it's true or...?""


 


Sherlock scoffed, his eyes narrowing playfully. ""You can't be serious.""


 


A full-blown smile broke out over John's features and he couldn't help but laugh. ""No, I'm not, but you can't deny that I had you going there for a moment,"" he answered, digging his fingernails into the fleshy underside of the other man's arse.


 


Hissing softly, Sherlock melted into the touch, his hips rutting eagerly into the taught muscle of John's thigh as he felt his desperation mounting. ""Hmph, only in your wildest dreams,"" he huffed.


 


""Mmm, you can say that again,"" the doctor purred, squeezing the detective's arse once again. ""You in lingerie is definitely in my top three sexiest dreams I've ever had.""


 


Another hiss slipped past the detective's lips, this time accompanied by a quiet moan. His thickening erection rubbed teasingly back and forth as his hips set a steady rhythm, but his satisfaction was cut short. A sharp swat to his arse elicited a short yelp of pain from Sherlock's throat and he glared disapprovingly over his shoulder.


 


""Not yet, you don't,"" John warned in his best 'Captain Watson' voice, tracing his fingers over his lover's crease as he tugged a bottle of lubricant from behind one of the cushions on the sofa. ""If you're supposed to be my gift, then it's only fair that I get to open you up.""


 


The double entendre was not lost on Sherlock; his hips twitched eagerly but he did his best to stay still. ""Then, by all means, take your time,"" he huffed, shifting so that he could prop himself up on his elbows. The carrot hit the floor with a soft 

thump

 as the click of the lubricant bottle prepared him for the slick coolness of John's middle finger brushing over his entrance.


 


""Oh, I plan to,"" John growled, swirling the pad of his finger around Sherlock's hole before pressing gently against the furled muscle. ""I'm going to turn you inside out and wreck you completely all without touching your cock... but, first, you're going to suck me off with a smile on your face. Then, and only then, are you going to be allowed to come... Do I make myself clear?"" he asked, fixing Sherlock with a hardened stare in order to assert his unwavering dominance over the situation.


 


The subtle spark of interest in the detective's eyes roared into a blazing fire of arousal and he chewed his lip, allowing his submissive side to take complete control of his actions. ""Yes, sir... Whatever you wish..."" 


 


John's cock gave a twitch of approval as the title rolled off of Sherlock's tongue and the tip of his own tongue darted out to wet his lips. The heat of the moment pooled deep in his groin, sending a shiver down his spine as he realized he had his detective right where he wanted him.


 



Well... almost...

31 days before John and Mary's wedding



""Chinese or Italian?"" John asks distractedly as he shuffles through the takeout drawer, jumping at the opportunity to sneak in some high-cal, greasy food. The wedding is a month away, and Mary's been keeping a close eye on both their diets (""I have a dress to fit into, you have a suit. If I have to suffer, I'm taking you down with me.""). A bit too close. ""Sherlock?""

""Yes?""

""I asked, do you want-"" John says, throwing a careless glance in the direction Sherlock had just been staring.

What he finds there is the handyman Mrs. Hudson has had around the past few weeks, installing new sconces in the kitchen. She'd recently come into some money and decided that, following the flat's fall into disrepair while Sherlock was away, the time has come for some refurbishing.

More precisely --and more to the point-- Sherlock was staring at the man's arse, hanging mid-air like a denim-clad pinata.


Oh. 


""John?""

""Erm..."" John squints, squints very hard, because what he thinks just happened couldn't have really happened. ""Yeah?""

""Do I want to, what?"" Sherlock asks.

""What?""

""You asked whether I wanted to...""

""Oh, right,"" John says. ""Do you... do you want to order in or go out?""

""Mary doesn't want you eating out,"" Sherlock says, and John has to shake his head to remind himself that Sherlock is very rarely aware of double entendres, no matter how unfortunate they are. ""You still have those extra four pounds to lose if you want to get into that suit.""

John clears his throat, blushing despite himself. ""It's two and a half.""

""Mary and I think it's four,"" Sherlock says nonchalantly, staring down his microscope. John would have let it slide if it weren't for a barely-audible chuckle coming from Mr. Perfect Arse up on the ladder.

""It's barely two and a half, and I look just fine in the suit,"" John says. ""Look, do you want to eat or not?""

""I suppose outside is fine,"" Sherlock says with an overly-dramatic sigh, standing up from his chair.

""Get on with it, then."" John huffs, stealing another glance up the ladder before he leaves the kitchen. He manhandles Sherlock hurriedly towards the stairs before Sherlock even has a chance to tie his scarf.

""What's got into you?""

""Nothing,"" John sulks. ""Just go.""









28 days before John and Mary's wedding



John pushes the street door to 221 with his right shoulder, biting his lips in concentration. The two boxes he's carrying contain the kits for making their weddings favours - ones Sherlock had agreed to help in assembling - are not heavy, per se, but they are big and obstruct much of his view. Carrying them from the car park was a challenge that demanded a good measure of coordination and side-stepping, to avoid bumping into unsuspecting pedestrians.

He balances himself against the wall, wiping the sweat trickling down his temple. It's been an unseasonably warm couple of days. Mrs. Hudson's kitchen is quiet, so there's no one to jovially greet him there or maybe, just maybe, offer a cold drink before he trudges up the remaining stairs. Looking up at them with a frown, he takes a deep breath and starts his journey upstairs.

Still grunting, he's far too distracted to register the familiar voice coming from the depth of the flat. ""Would you, er,"" Sherlock clears his throat in uncharacteristic hesitation, ""would you like some lemonade?""

""Cheers,"" a man's breathy voice says cheerily. ""Would love some.""

John freezes mid-movement.


Mr. Pinata.


He'd completely forgotten about him; by the time they came back to Baker Street the other day, the man wasn't there anymore, so John just dismissed Sherlock's wandering eyes as a one-time fluke. Or so he thought.

John, still frozen in place with his mouth hanging open, hears a glass placed on the counter; then he hears what must be the proffered lemonade being poured. There's a short, loud silence in the flat, and then-

""'S lovely,"" The man says, sighing contentedly. ""Did you make it?""

John nearly snorts at the mere thought. As if Sherlock would ever-

""Yes,"" Sherlock says, wiping John's smug smile.

""It's gorgeous.""

Oh, John swallows, his chest tightening. Bloody hell.

""Your name is... Rory?""

The other man hums in confirmation.

""I'm-""

""Sherlock Holmes,"" Rory says. John's brain is a hot, fuzzy mess right now, but it manages to pick up on the man's heavy Australian accent. ""Yeah, I know who you are. They say you're a bloody genius.""

""I don't know who they are,"" Sherlock says haughtily, ""but they're not wrong.""

Rory laughs brightly, easily. ""No Dr. Watson today?""

John tries to swallow again, heart pounding, and it's then that he realizes that he can't because his mouth is hanging open. He stands there, boxes in hands, looking back and forth between the stairs and the door as though even these inanimate objects would agree that this is... weird.

Should he... leave? Is he... interrupting? This is clearly flirting, isn't it?

""Dr. Watson's busy,"" Sherlock says matter-of-factly. ""Wedding preparations.""

""I suppose it's just the two of us, then.""

""I suppose it is.""

And it's then that John's brain rebels in the face of whatever fresh hell this situation is, because - Christ.


Getting married, John. He's your best man, John. 


""No, actually. I'm right here,"" he moves with a grunt to open the door, putting the boxes down - nonchalantly, of course. As nonchalantly as one can muster carrying wedding favors during a hot jealous streak for the person he is most certainly not marrying.

Amidst Sherlock's surprised 'John?' and Rory's friendly 'Dr. Watson!', he takes in their arrangement. Rory is on his knees facing the under-sink cabinet, wrench in hand. Sherlock stands next to him, holding Rory's empty glass.

""Am I, er... interrupting anything?""

""Of course not,"" Sherlock says, finally moving away towards the kitchen table. ""Mr. Adams here was just fixing the sink.""

""Oh, right."" Mr. Adams my arse. ""Didn't you fix that sink a few days ago?""

""I did.""

""I may have..."" Sherlock clears his throat. ""Thrown some things in there that I shouldn't have.""

""Can you believe this guy?"" Rory shakes his head in delight, pointing at Sherlock as he crawls back under the sink.

""Yeah, he's... something,"" John says, his voice edging on shrill. ""Is that lemonade?""

""Excellent deduction skills as always, John.""

""I'd love some.""

""Help yourself,"" Sherlock says as he sits at the table, examining a suspicious looking petri dish. Rory peeks his head out of the cabinet in search of something or another in his toolbox, sending another smile in John's direction.

""Hope you didn't use the ice from the back of the freezer for this,"" John says, rubbed the wrong way a bit, following Sherlock's dismissal.

""Of course I didn't,"" Sherlock says. 

""The things he keeps in there."" John says. ""Not for the faint-hearted.""

""Nothing I haven't seen before."" Rory shrugs. ""Was a Park Ranger myself back home. Takes a lot to surprise me. Ever been to Australia, Dr. Watson?""

""Just an overnight stop on the way to New Zealand,"" John says. Sherlock hums mysteriously next to him.

""New Zealand's nothing compared to Queensland, believe me,"" Rory says. ""Aren't you getting married soon?""

""Er, yes.""

""You should take the missus to Australia for your honeymoon, mate,"" Rory whispers conspiratorially. ""They do 'glamping now these days; you sleep in a fancy tent with electricity and wha' not. It's dead right in the middle of a nature reserve - very romantic. Plenty of exotic nature and time to do nothing much but stay in bed,"" Rory looks between Sherlock and John, adding a knowing wink, ""if you catch my drift.""

John smiles tightly. ""Yes, I think I do.""

""The Indonesian Indian cobra is the fifteenth deadliest snake in the world, and all the other fourteen are in Australia,"" Sherlock blurts, apropos of nothing. The other two men turn to look at him, frowning. ""Let's just say that given their survival skills, the Watsons will have a better time in exotic Brighton.""

John knows he's gone red, flushed from neck to cheeks. ""It was Mary's choice. She's never been.""

""Of course,"" Sherlock says, entirely inscrutable, while Rory nods amiably (""Brighton is very nice too, mate.'').

""So, a park ranger?"" John asks eventually, once the conversation dies down and Rory moves to pour himself another glass of lemonade.

""Yeah, right outside Brisbane.""

""How'd you end up a handyman in London?""

""Oh, you know how it is,"" Rory says. ""Got sick of all of those poisonous creatures. Snakes and fish and spiders. Couldn't stand them after a while. People getting bitten and coming crying to me about it, even though we tell them to be careful. They never listen.""

""Fair enough.""

""You know what the best way to avoid dying from a snake bite is?"" Rory asks.

John raises a curious eyebrow.

""Don't get bitten!"" Rory and Sherlock say simultaneously, exchanging a small, surprised smirk.

""Besides,"" Rory smiles, a charming, disarming, Australian smile that's very clearly not directed at John. His next words aren't, either. ""Always been good with my hands,"" he says before disappearing back under the sink.







There's a flurry of activity in Baker Street later that evening, with Mrs. Hudson bringing up dinner, Lestrade popping in to say hi and drop off a case, and even a client that scuttles away in a hurry before ever reaching the door when Sherlock makes himself quite clear he will not, under any circumstances, be ""aiding and abetting narcissistic Neo-Nazis.""

John barely registers any of it, what with the relentless alarm bells going off in his head.

There's a deep pit in his stomach, getting deeper with every passing second as his eyes bore a hole at Sherlock's nape. The detective sits on the floor with his back to John, gathering the last of the favours into the big carton box.

You're in trouble, a small voice whispers somewhere in the back of his brain. You're in deep, deep trouble, Watson.

""All done,"" Sherlock says suddenly with a lopsided grin, and John feels like a deer in a headlight. He hums, because there's not much else he can say in his current state, and watches as Sherlock gets up from the floor, walking away.

""I'm off for a shower. You can see yourself out?""

John can't feel his hands. He wants to say so many things. Pathetic, greedy, unfair things filled with feelings he should not be feeling, not a month before his wedding. ""Sherlock?""

""Yes?""


Listen, I know I'm getting married but could you please not flirt with the gorgeous Australian? 


(Oh God)


Do you ever flirt back?


(You should, you know. In another place, another time, I would have-)


Have you ever been with a man? 


(Bloody hell)


Have you ever been with anyone at all?


(Fuck)


Why now, Sherlock? Why him?


""John?"" Sherlock sizes him up, his eyes sharp and keen and curious.

""Nothing, nothing."" He swallows again. ""Good night, Sherlock.""








21 days before John and Mary's wedding


The next Saturday is Rory-free and the weather is a complete and utter contrast to the day of The Lemonade Incident, as John has since come to call it. Baker Street is freezing cold, despite the roaring fire in the old fireplace. Sometime last night the sky had opened up and it's been pouring rain ever since, dampening John's already-sour mood further.

He stares at the kettle, waiting for it to boil. While Sherlock and Mary have been obsessing over seating arrangements, he's been relegated to tea making due to his general moping about and grumpily voicing all the (apparently) wrong opinions.

The kettle boils, filling the flat with sounds of whistling steam and burbling water. Mary's hushed whisper travels from her place on the sofa.

""Did you ask him?""

""No, not yet.""

""Well, what are you waiting for?"" She asks in an urgent hush. ""Mrs. Hudson says he's lovely. I'm sure he'll say yes.""

John's hand freezes mid-movement; he half-turns squinting, straining his ear in concentration.


(I'm fine. It's fine!)


""He's in a committed relationship with a woman, Mary."" Sherlock whispers back. ""I don't think he much goes for that sort of thing.""

""You won't know till you ask,"" Mary says in that pushy sort of way she does that John had always found so lovely. ""And there's not much time left, you know. We'll need to know before we finalize everything. I'll ask him myself if you won't.""

""Mary-""

S""Please don't tell me the great Sherlock Holmes is too shy to ask-""

""Alright!"" Sherlock snaps, shushing her. ""Alright.""

""There's a good man.""

(It's all fine.)







John's not fine.








19 days before John and Mary's wedding


""I'm afraid I'm a bit under the weather today, Mrs. Hudson, Mr. Holmes,"" Rory says from the kitchen, wiping his dirty hands on a used flannel. John steals a furtive glance from his chair by the window as he types up their most recent case; an unsolved one, about a guardsman that nearly died in John's hands. ""Would you be very upset if I came back some other day to finish the sealing on the windows?""

""Oh dear, of course not,"" Mrs. Hudson coos, the same way she always does at handsome young men. ""I hope it's nothing serious.""

""You're too kind,"" he waves a dismissive hand. ""Just a little under the weather. Might be a bit of a stomach flu.""

""Yes, that's been making the rounds recently. John here is a doctor, you know,"" she says, dragging Rory into the sitting room. ""John, dear? Rory isn't feeling well. Any doctorly advice?""

""Probably best if you just leave."" John blurts over the static in his brain that seems to be ever-present in the presence of the handyman. When he looks up, he finds six pairs of eyes looking curiously his way. He clears his throat. ""To rest. And drink plenty of liquid, of course."" He huffs uncomfortably, slowly transitioning into incoherent mumbling. ""That's sort of a stupid thing to say, isn't it? 'Cause you can't drink a solid, can you?""

Sherlock's forehead creases in confusion. ""Soup?""

""What?""

""Soup is solids suspended in liquid,"" Sherlock says, ""so it qualifies as a liquid.""

John smiles sourly. ""See that? Sherlock here is a graduate chemist, so occasionally that's useful.""

""Occasionally?"" Sherlock turns his sharp eyes at him, affronted. ""I've built a thriving career thanks to it.""

""I should go. Thank you, Dr. Watson,"" Rory says, offering one last apologetic smile, bending down to pick up his hoards of tools boxes. Before he comes up, though, he doubles back, dizzy. ""Oh.""

""Boys, help him."" Mrs. Hudson commands them with a half-whisper that never fails to get them to do exactly as she says. Both Sherlock and John march quickly across the room. Sherlock picks one toolbox (the lighter one, of course, the wanker), as John picks the other. It's all fine until he straightens up, grunting at the weight of it, and-


Fuck.


He's betrayed by the telling sound of his back cracking like a twig, closing his eyes with a mixture of stabbing pain and embarrassment flushing up his body.

""John?"" Sherlock asks. ""Are you alright?""

""Ahhhr.""

""You're not alright,"" Sherlock says, and John hates himself for loving the hint of worry in the detective's voice.

""Oh, my."" Mrs. Hudson whispers, clutching her own cheeks. He thinks. He can't actually see her, what with his vision has gone black.

""Blimey,"" Rory says, quickly shaking off his own general malaise. ""Let me... take this from you, mate.""

""Mmm.""

Sherlock turns to him, admonishing. ""Always lift with your knees, John-""

""Mmmm-"" He grunts with pain as Mrs. Hudson gently leads him to the sofa.

""You're not a young man anymore-""

""Yes, thank you for the reminder, Sherlock-""

""Mary's going to kill you-""

""Shut up, Sherlock!"" John calls out through a haze of blinding pain and cold sweat.

""What should I do?"" Sherlock looks down at him hesitantly.

""Move the pillows,"" John grunts. ""And something for the pain.""

Sherlock nods obediently, turning on his heels with a swish of his robe.

""Wait, Sherlock, look!"" Mrs. Hudson tuts, pointing to a box by the fireplace. ""He might need that. You go on, don't let him go without it. I'll take care of this one here.""

""But-""

""Go!""

John listens to Sherlock's footsteps as he heads downstairs, shutting his eyes tightly.

""Here you go,"" Mrs. Hudson says, helping him sit up. ""Brought you some water, too.""

He takes the proffered pills and downs them, taking a big long breath as he lies back down. Mrs. Hudson sits on the table next to him, patting his hand lovingly. ""Is that better?""

""Mmmm,"" he croaks, his voice strained. ""Wasn't even that heavy.""

""Looked plenty heavy to me,"" she says kindly, and he can't help but smile at the goodwill. ""It's the wedding jitters, if you ask me,"" she stage-whispers, winking. ""You'll be as good as new in no time.""

""I hope so.""

""You men are too proud to admit that, but you must be nervous."" She says. ""I know I was. I was terrified. I kept thinking, 'Am I really choosing to spend the rest of my life with this man?'. Sounds mad! But he was the love of my life, Mr. Hudson was."" She hums. ""There was nobody else for me.""

John stares at the ceiling, his vision blurring with dread.

""You love Mary,"" she waves dismissively. ""You know what I mean.""

""Of course.""

""Of course,"" she nods knowingly, falling silent for a long, stretching moment. ""He's a nice young man, Rory is,"" she says with a side-glance. ""Isn't he?""

""Yeah,"" he says, his voice sounding unnaturally mechanical.

""He's been coming over a lot. I think he fancies Sherlock.""

John swallows. ""Imagine that.""

""It's nice, dear. So very good for both of you. You moved on, he moved on."" She smiles again, nodding. It's a warm, understanding thing. ""It's going to be a great wedding.""

John lifts his chin, his lips pursed stubbornly, holding back a deluge of stifled words; words he's been expertly pushing down for years. He looks up at her wordlessly and he wonders -- not for the first time -- if she knows.


Of course she knows.


""You rest, now."" She pats his hand one last time, covering him with a blanket. He resigns himself to the powerful wave of pain medication doing its job. Right on time. ""There you go.""











14 days before John and Mary's wedding


""Sherlock!"" Lestrade bursts through the street door to 221b, John in tow, rushing in from the mortuary after receiving a call that the Camden Lock Garroter (a locksmith!) was --to everyone's surprise-- found hiding inside a tree trunk in Hampstead Heath.

Sherlock, who'd spent the morning pestering Molly at Barts, had disappeared hours ago and hasn't been answering the phone since.

Lestrade is, understandably, fuming. ""Sherlock!""

""Sherlock!"" John joins the chorus, running up behind the DI; their adrenaline pumping through their veins, they take the stairs two at a time, excitedly.

""You'd better not be sleeping, you bastard!"" Lestrade says, ripping the door to the sitting room open; he stops in his place so abruptly John is left with no choice but to bump straight into the man's back. ""What the-""

""What..."" John recovers quickly, taking a step back. What he sees when he peeks over the DI's shoulder is so unexpected, so strange, he shakes his head like a dog out of water. ""Sherlock?""

""Don't you knock, Lestrade?"" Sherlock huffs indignantly.

There's Rory, and there's Sherlock, with his shirt sleeves rolled up and his robe thrown haphazardly over his shoulders. The two stand in the middle of the sitting room, all furniture cleared and pushed against the walls.

And they're standing... Close. Intimately close. It's then that John's other senses finally kick in, and everything suddenly makes sense. There's music. A waltz. And the cleared furniture, and Rory's flushed face.


Dancing.


Rory and Sherlock have been... dancing.

""Hello, Dr. Watson,"" Rory says, sending a cheery smile. Lestrade turns to look at John with an inscrutable smile that John really has to work hard to ignore, otherwise he'd have no choice but to punch the man.

Rory clears his throat. ""Looks like our secret is out, Mr. Holmes.""

""It would seem so.""

""What's going on?"" Lestrade asks.

""What do you think is going on?"" Sherlock says petulantly. ""Mr. Adams and I are rehearsing.""

""Rehearsing what?"" Lestrade asks, endlessly amused.

""John and Mary's waltz.""

""What?"" John frowns.

""Mary asked me to teach you how to waltz for the wedding, but I needed help road testing the piece before I take on that monumental, and dare I say impossible, task,"" Sherlock says. ""Rory's about your size and build. It was only logical to practice the steps with him first.""

""Oh,"" John blinks. Oh. Blinks again. Rewinding back through every second over the past couple of weeks. Oh.

""This is all very lovely, Fred Astaire, but we have eyes on Peters in Hampstead Heath."" Lestrade says.

Sherlock's eyes widen in surprise. ""I was right!""

""Of course you bloody were,"" Lestrade says. ""Go, for Christ's sake! Get dressed!""

""Excuse me!"" Sherlock says excitedly, tearing himself away from Rory who stands in the middle of the sitting room, shuffling his legs uncomfortably.

""I suppose I'll just-"" Rory points hesitantly at the door, moving past them on his way out. ""Nice to see you again.""

""Yeah."" John sniffs, watching the handyman leaving, perfect arse and all. ""Off you go.""







John spends the rest of the evening avoiding Lestrade's knowing eyes.







""You didn't have to punch him,"" Sherlock says, his voice deep and warm, as they reach the flat a few hours later, breathless and red-cheeked from exertion.

John giggles, a high-pitched, deeply satisfied thing. ""I didn't, but he's a murderer,"" he says, and a deep rumble escapes Sherlock. ""And a right bastard.""

""That he is,"" Sherlock says, removing his scarf.

""What are we going to call this one?"" John says, stepping into the sitting room.

""The Nestled Locksmith? Behind Trunk and Key?""

""Skeyletons in the Closet?""

""Good lord, John,"" Sherlock rolls his eyes imperiously and John can't help another bellyful of giggles.

""I'll figure something out,"" John promises and Sherlock hums contently in response.

John scans the room again, remembering waltzes and Rorys. He bites his lips. ""So.""

Sherlock perks a brow, curious.

""A waltz?""

""A fairly standard one."" Sherlock shrugs. ""At Mary's request.""

John rocks uncomfortably on the balls of his feet. ""You dance?""

""What if I do?""

John can't help a crooked smile at that. He straightens where he stands, eyes the man standing in front him from head to toe. Sherlock looks back, challenging, measuring. Of course you do, you bastard, he wants to say. You have the body of a dancer. A tall, gorgeous, broody dancer.

""Teach me,"" John says, spreading his hands invitingly.

""What?""

""You've been practicing with Mr. Handyman so you could teach me,"" John says. ""Haven't you?""

""I have.""

""Well, here I am. The real thing,"" he says, taking a step closer. ""Teach me.""

Sherlock eyes him for a long, tense beat, and John finds himself bracing for a brusque rejection, a cruel joke at his expense.

He takes another step forward, holding his breath, closing the distance. They're nearly touching now; almost, but not yet. There's a crease in Sherlock's forehead he can't seem to decipher, so he tries again. ""I've waltzed before, you know. I'm not a complete basket case.""

Sherlock swallows. ""Did you?""

""My aunt loved it."" He nods. ""Said I was her favorite dance partner.""

Sherlock's eyes narrow, sparkling mischievously. ""How old were you?

""Eight."" He says, pushing down a crooked grin.

""That's not very promising.""

""Shut your bloody mouth,"" John says, cupping Sherlock's shoulder blade with his right hand, reaching for Sherlock's hand with the other. ""And dance.""

""What do you think you're doing?""

John frowns, his eyes shooting up to Sherlock's. ""I'm- I'm leading.""

""No, you're not."" Sherlock shakes his head. ""I need to see how you follow first.""

""But-""

""Who's the teacher, John?"" Sherlock says imperiously. He gathers John into his arms, taking over the leading position.

John's eyes slide shut inadvertently, drawn to Sherlock's warmth, taken by surprise by his gentle grasp. ""You are,"" he croaks, all fight in him gone. Doesn't bloody matter, as long you stay right there.

""Ready?"" Sherlock asks, grabbing the remote control with a stretch of his arm.

""Hmmm,"" is all John can offer in return.

And then they dance.







He's downright bereft when Sherlock leaves his side mid-dance, taking with him the comforting wall of heat his body is.

He's left wanting when Sherlock moves to remove his jacket; has to pull his hands away to prevent them from balling possessively around the man's midsection as he steps away.

(He perks right up with the new sensation underneath the crispy-white thin fabric).

He finds -- rather quickly and unsurprisingly -- that he is yet again in very big trouble. He does not want to lose this precious access to Sherlock's body - not tonight, not ever. He definitely does not wish to yield said access to other people, namely bright-eyed Australians in snug, stone-washed Levi's.

The waltz is haunting and unfamiliar; there is something joyous in the melody, but every now and then there's just a tinge of sadness. It is a song of love and pain, a congratulation and a goodbye; it pulls at John's heartstrings, a perfect soundtrack for the beating of his traitorous heart. And Sherlock... Sherlock is a wonderful teacher and a beautiful dancer and he smells like sandalwood and freshly-cut Hampstead Heath grass and home and--


Shit.


Sherlock unfurls himself from John's grip again. He moves to the table, grabbing a pencil and marking something on a sheet of notes. John studies his back, using the moment to catch his wrecked breath. Sherlock's head tilts in concentration, and he scribbles another quick note.

John frowns in confusion. ""What are you doing?""

""An adjustment.""

""To what?""

""To the piece.""

""What piece?""

""The waltz, John,"" Sherlock says, and John's chest tightens.

""You..."" he starts, his face clouding. He feels dizzy. ""You wrote this?""

Sherlock's tall figure freezes at the question. He clears his throat and turns, scanning John's face in that way he always does when he can't be sure what sort of trouble he's got himself into. ""John?""

John wobbles, heart hammering in his chest. ""Did you?""

""Yes,"" Sherlock concedes, ducking his head. ""It's a... gift. ""

""Oh,"" John says. ""For... Mary and me?""

Sherlock hums. He steps back into John's personal space, coming closer and closer. ""Mostly for you. A... parting gift, of sorts.""


Parting?


""Oh. That's--"" He says, blinking hard against a hint of moisture there, slowly scratching his beard. Sherlock is close, so close it's intoxicating. John looks up, searching for the other man's eyes. Where are you going? His own eyes ask. ""That's--""

""John?""

He takes a deep, stuttering breath as his hands bunch a piece of fabric on Sherlock's waist, holding on for dear life. ""You're...""

""What?"" Sherlock frowns, shaking his head in confusion. Everything around John sounds drowned out, as though he has gone underwater and all he can think of is Sherlock's breath mingling with his. And then he kisses him - oh god, I'm kissing him - and Sherlock sighs (lightly, contentedly), and John's hands spread open, holding on tightly and pulling him down (he's kissing me back, he's kissing back).

The pull throws them off their feet and Sherlock sways, teetering forward (good, better, more, more). They kiss, and kiss, until last note hovers in the air, whittling out with a flourished finality that has no place in this moment, in this place.

The sound dies away, the moment gone. John comes up for air, rubbing his cheek against Sherlock's.

""John-"" Sherlock says nervously, breathing hard.

""Shhh-""

Sherlock's hands bunch just as possessively against John's back. ""This is-""

""It's perfect, Sherlock,"" John whispers, hugging him tighter. ""It's perfect.""

The words bring such relief to Sherlock, John feels his chest emptying of air; he leans his head against the crook of John's neck. They breathe loudly, raggedly together, both trying to catch up on the reality of the moment.

""Rory,"" John says, apropos of nothing.

Sherlock snuggles closely still. ""What about him?""

""I thought you two were..."" John says, attempting a smile and failing miserably. ""He's been all over you.""

Sherlock smiles nervously. ""He's not really my type, John.""

""Had to stop myself from punching his beautiful face,"" John says. ""Multiple times.""

Sherlock shakes his head. ""John, please. You know me better than that.""

""I've been so jealous, Sherlock."" He admits weakly, shame rushing through his veins.

""I know the feeling,"" Sherlock says, looking down and away.

The admission hits John like a lightning bolt, and he wonders if Sherlock will ever be able to pick up his remains from the messy heap on the floor. The decision (if there really ever was one) is made swiftly, like a band-aid ripped in one fell swoop. It doesn't hurt nearly as bad as it probably should, and later he will ask himself what his life would have looked like if he'd made another choice.

But that's all hyperbole, and in the past now.

John grabs Sherlock's hand, squeezing it. Sherlock's flushed and beautiful, and John doesn't want another minute wasted. ""I have to go.""

""John-""

""I have something to take care of,"" he says, looking at Sherlock meaningfully. ""I'll be back in an hour. Maybe two. Hopefully one.""

""We're..."" Sherlock says, worried-looking. ""We've not finished practicing.""

""We're... not going to need it,"" John says with a hesitant half-smile, shrugging into his jacket. ""You could write a new one while I'm gone.""

""A new one?""

""'A waltz for Sherlock and John',"" he says, grabbing the door. ""How does that sound?""

And Sherlock smiles, a smile John has never seen before, and he knows that for the first time in his lifetime of misguided, miserable choices, he's finally made the right one.

Usually, these days would be spent moping around the flat, having occasional mental meltdowns and the rare phantom hallucinations of his deceased flatmate moving along the premises of the flat, with his dressing robe dragging on the floor. John had to practically yell at his brain to stop all this nonsense

'God, I wish I had that memory-deleting ability of that bastard. Sure would be convenient to ease all of this'

The thought was accompanied by a vague gesture of both the blond's hands, waving at his surrounding, which was their flat. Despise cursing to forget all of this, forget his time with Sherlock, deep down John knew if he could, he wouldn't After all the memories were too precious to him, almost as precious as the man those memories were shared with. Bloody sentiments

'I guess this is why Sherlock always says - well said that sentiment was a weakness'

The doctor chuckled sadly, his left hand covering his face as he leaned against the wall of the living room. No sooner had he put his hand down than he caught sight of the smiled made by numerous bullets, courtesy of bloody Sherlock Holmes on one of his deemed boring days. Almost instantly, John felt his stomach twist in pain.

"" BASTARD, FUCKING TWAT"" He screamed, punching the wall in a fit of frustration, ignoring the pain slowly creeping in on his hand and the rattling of the wall decorations.

'This is fucking ridiculous. I was a soldier for fuck sake, I killed people, I watched my comrades die before my eyes, and none of that shit managed to break me and yet Sherlock Holmes with his bloody high cheekbones, icy blue eyes, arrogant attitude, mysterious black coat, snarky remarks, inconsiderate nature and that oh-so-damn brilliant mind of his did. I am supposed to be stronger than this. I am supposed to...

Before John could continue to battle with his mind, a sudden knock snapped him back to reality.

"" John, how are you today, dear."" 

It was Mrs. Hudson

"" No better than a man who witnessed his best friend commit suicide right in front of his eyes "" He replied, mustering a light-hearted tone to mask his real emotions, he even added to dismissive wave for good measure.

Unfortunately, Mrs. H here wanted none of that shit. Scrunching her nose up which made her eyes look squinted, looking like she was looking straight through his soul. Though not long after, her face dropped into one of sympathy and sadness.

John shifted his feet in discomfort and slight annoyance. He hated receiving looks like that, they made him feel weak and so exposed. Despite knowing the kind landlady just wanted to help him through his difficult time, it had proven impossible for John to ignore his rather negative emotions about Mrs. Hudson's expression

"" Oh dear boy, I know this is very difficult for you, given the rather intimate relationship between the two of you. Sherlock never had a lot of friends. Believe me, not many have that patience of yours to get to know him truly.""She started 

"" Mrs. Hudson, I have ready told you, I am not gay. Sherlock and I were never a thing"" John retorted. Truth to be told, He himself wasn't even sure if the words that had come out of his mouth were true. It's not like he was disgusted by the thought of being attracted to a bloke but this is Sherlock we are talking about, the one who always deemed relationship to be beneath him. The first meeting had proven and solidified this idea very well, to the point that to John, it was as blatantly true as the bloody solar system or other common facts.

"" Oh, an old lady like I can dream"" She responded playfully, waving her hand around in an attempt to lighten the atmosphere.

Not wanting to upset Mrs. Hudson and maybe himself, John only chuckled along with her.

"" Now since I have gotten you to lighten up a bit, here- she said as a bag of cookies was offered to John- I made a little too much . Might as well let you enjoy some goodies. And do remember to clean all this mess up, dear. I am your landlady, not your housekeeper, John""

And with that, she was out the doors, not without giving a last assuring glance at the army doctor.Closing the doors, John fell back to his robotic state, slumping against the wall

"" God if only you knew how people care about you, Sherlock. Always going on and on about being a sociopath, having no friends but you have friends , people who care about you. They care about you , bloody idiot .-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I care about you""


God, if anyone sees me now, they will think I am a complete nutter, mourning the death of my best friend more than necessary


 


 Ring ring  


John jumped a little in his position, before realizing it was his phone 

'Of course '

He clumsily reached for it to discover who would have the need to call him during the weekend . Definitely not his patients. The word "" Greg"" popped up brightly on his phone .Pressing the green circle  he bought it up to his ear, preparing to hear whatever that was coming

"" Hello Lestrade, what is it? "" He started 

"" Oh hey J-John"" The man on the other line responded  Despite not being as observant as Sherlock, John could clearly sense the shakiness of his voice and maybe a slight tiredness in it 

"" Lestrade ,have you been sleeping well?  "" The doctor in him started taking over. Really wish the doctor in John would also have the consideration to take care of himself 

"" Oh I-i am quite well - the sound accompanied that statement was a slurping one, which John concluded was Lestrade sipping on his coffee. He hoped it wasn't the coffee at New Scotland Yard as the coffee they offered there was disgusting  with its grainy texture and slimy sensation after you swallowed it. Sure it did its job well  providing the police with enough caffeine to get through the day but dear Lord , he was not going to have another taste of that solution that the officers of New Scotland Yard called coffee. He had tasted better in Afghanistan, even during the supply shortages. 

"" It's just that - Lestrade started again, albeit this time less shaky and more somber in a way - I have been having trouble with this case. My team have worked relentlessly on this shit for days and the progress are being made at snail's paceand we have just barely solved it . And now there is a new murder By God, I wish we had Sher- I mean him here . He would have solved this case in less than 20 minutes  I would even endure a damn lecture of his, telling us off as idiots Now with Anderson and Emalia gone , one due to family affair  one due to her child's accident, we are even more stuck on this case "" Lestrade stopped ,realizing he was rambling 

' Probably due to the stress ' John concluded and silently nodded his head in agreement  despite the fact that the detective inspector wouldn't be able to take notice of that 

"" So - John faked a cough - from what I am hearing is you want me to help you "" He suggested 

The one on the other line swallowed a lump down his throat. 

"" Yes ,I know this is hard for you. But I promise it will be quick  I just need to you to look around the case ,see what caused the victim death and anything strange. I can't afford to take another scolding from my supervisor. But I can't find anyone to stand in for the two at the moment and you're my best bet. I know this is a tad selfish  mate but I just need a few hours of your time "" Lestrade pleaded 

John was surprised for a moment, he never thought Lestrade would be this distressed to need help from him. Sure he accompanied Sherlock on a lot of his cases but he was always in the background, just a decoration, someone who could easily be forgotten. 

"" Lestrade,..  ..  I don't think I can-""

"" John please, I am begging you. You just need to stand in for Anderson and Emalia for one or two days ,only a few hours each. "" 

' Well it wouldn't be hard to help him ,he does sound desperate. I can't possibly leave him like this '

"" Fine , I will help Lestrade but don't come at me when I can't see anything more than you okay ? "" 

"" Oh thank god ,I won't ""

 

 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

"" Okay , Lestrade I will be there in an hour or so"" John bid his goodbye to Lestrade after the Detective Inspector had sent him the address 

' Well since I have nothing to do here, besides acting like a complete lunatic, might as well help Lestrade as much as I can. My therapist did say I needed to get out more often and not only for work' Thought John as he reminisced on his latest session


 [?] 



"" John, I believe some getting out of the house would most likely do you some good""  The sound of Ella's voice barely registered in John's mind



"" Believe me, I tried""  John responded, now rising himself up from the couch on which he had just been lying a few minutes ago to end his session. Bidding Ella a half-hearted goodbye, John took his coat from the coat hanger and walked out the doors. They had been having this conversation for three weeks now and it was beginning to drive him up the damn bullet punctured wall, but he wasn't going to lash out at Ella as she was trying to help him. It was her job and he was at fault for being a stubborn bloke who couldn't even get over these traumas despite having gone to therapy for months



 [?] 


'Maybe I am just too weak, too broken to be fixed'  The idea stung him sharply, more painful than the bullet that shot through his shoulder. Shaking his sandy blond head side to side to shut that idea off, he quickly changed to get ready to go assist Lestrade with a case , without Sherlock , and he was damn determined to keep all of his bubbling shit and turmoil together until he was isolated from the eyes of the public in the flat to break down in peace and weep his eyes till his heart was content, lest he be seen as weak or worse a bloody nutter. 

 

 

"" Here dear, some money for you to spend and have fun. "" A woman said with a sweet tone 

 almost too sweet  it was almost like those cheap candy handed out of obligation on Halloween and would soon be throw in the trash since even a kid would say it was too sweet, too artificial 

while handling a few crumbled bills of fivers and tenners to the young child, most likely hers. Having made the child accept the money, she put on a honey smile and pat his blond head before bidding him farewell

"" Just stay here and have some fun. Mommy will come get you soon after she and her boyfriend have had some private time together "" She said and then walk back to her car, not even bothering to wait for a response from her precious child or find out why he was carrying a backpack a little too big for his size and another bag currently residing in his small hands 

' Like hell you will' The boy thought bitterly ' I can obviously see through your lies, running off with your boyfriend while leaving me behind. How typical ' he finished thinking, wiping off the tear from his left eye but he wasn't going to beg mother to let him stay by her side

As much as he hated the idea of being left behind, he was definitely not going stay with his mother any longer. 

As the car speeded off, he didn't bat an eye at it and quickly went to sit near one of the benches of the entrance of the park, whose location was unfamiliar to him so he concluded that he was probably too far from his house so walking home was a no no and even if he could, there could still be a possibility of the house already being sold off to fuel mother and her boyfriend's addiction. 

Face turning into a grimace, he silent vowed to stay away from those disaster-causing things that can reduce humans to just a bunch of mindless, brainless thugs looking for their next hit .Unlike his once-was-brilliant-but-now-a-dimwit-due-to-drug mother, the boy was bright and mature for his age, too mature - well technically, he had to if he wanted to survive and not get taken advantage of by corrupted and vile adults 

'Honestly if mother is this far gone, I wonder how father is doing? What if he isn't even alive? Great another bad thing added to cons of being an accidental drug baby  '

' And the school taught me that a mother would never abandon her child. Yeah right, those sugar coating jerks' Lamented the boy as he looked out to the scenery of the park with people all going on with their lives so peacefully, so carefree. He envied them. 

' I might as well map out a plan since mother decided that this child is too worthless and expensive to keep, and she needs more time for her boyfriend and her"" Happy pills "" '. His pale hand started to rummage through his bag, pulling out a small paper. 

' good thing I managed to nip a map of London from school before summer break started. Never thought I would one day need this though. And the phone I stole from Mother should come in handy. But calling Mr and Miss police now will be risky and I don't think they will believe me, a child. I need to solve this before summer ends, I need to have a good education if I want to get out of this. I hope birth certificate would come in handy ' 

He remained still for arguably thirty minutes, just observing the scene and the people, taking in every detail of them, connecting the invisible dots in his head. It was a good stress relief, he admitted 

A loud sound interrupted his thinking progress. Turning his head around, the imagine of a police car came into view. 

' Brilliant ' He thought, optimistically for once 

' I can request them for help. Everything is going to be fine. I will be safe . I already packed up everything I would need.Honestly , If mother had wanted to leave me, she should have made more effort to hide that desire from me '

Packing his stuff like lightning, he leaped off his seat and followed the car's trace. The following didn't last so long as the car soon came to a stop before the middle of a street known notoriously for being busy, only that it wasn't today. And the large puddle of blood and many various others of lesser size splattered around may have contributed to this 

Despite the many people stepping back from the bloody scene, the boy just felt compelled to get closer and so he did, ever so carefully. 

 

If anyone has anything to suggest or criticize, please put it in the comment section, I am always game for some improvements, especially in this work as it is my first one

"" Okay Lestrade, I am here "" John greeted the silver-haired detective . And his eyes widened in surprise. 

Dear Christ and Satan's left pierced nipple, he looked horrible, like a piece of tuna drenched in sewage and then eaten and regurgitated by a wolf and then finally mixed with mud . Okay it was a bit exaggerated but you get the idea. 

' Hair messy as a crow's nest, insanely heavy eye bags, look like he is at brink of a bloody breakdown. AND DEAR GOD IS ACTUALLY DRINKING COFFEE FROM THE YARD ' 

John knew that Lestrade was stressed but he didn't know he was this stressed. 

"" Lestrade, mate are you really okay? "" John asked, once again his inner doctor Watson making a spectacular return

It took Lestrade a moment to acknowledge John's existence, let alone register the doctor's question but he soon got to it. Fumbling with the cup of disgusting coffee in his hand and a report file in the other, he went up to John to greet him

"" Hey John, y-yeah i'm fine. Just bloody dandy. "" He said, faking a cheery voice which was no way convincing and definitely didn't require a genius to look through that 

"" Lestrade"" John growled, activating his doctor voice, the one he always used when his patient was worrying too much about their pride and not being honest about their conditions and life habits, which was too many times to count, not even mentioning the times he had to use it force Sherlock to eat or else he would faint right after solving the case and you can guess who had the honor of carrying the world's biggest overgrown toddle back to the flat. 

"" oKay - Lesstrade finally fessed up - no, I haven't been fine. It's like all the crime imaginable just started to rise up the bloody damn roof after Sherlock's death . Don't even get me to mention the pricking damn scandals his death has caused, the yard is having a bad reputation for it and several officers have been put off duty due to bad conduct , which leave the remaining ones, including me to deal with all of this shit. And my record these day has been shut and Dearest god everything is so damn shitty with everything. The cases, the scandals, the news, the paparazzi * shudder* "" By the time Lestrade had finally finished, he was out of breath and was breathing heavily like a one of those genetically bred to be insanely cute but also ended up with breathing problems flat faced cats. 

John didn't know how to deal with this subject so all he could do was offering some condolences to his friend. 

"" I am so sorry for that, Lestrade. The news of Sherlock being a fake has really affected you badly, eh"" John nearly choked when he reached the Sherlock being a fake part. There was no ways scientifically or realistically that Sherlock was a fake. It angered him to see people think so lowly of his best friend.Sure he had a lot of shortcomings,. Sure he was , most of the times, an arrogant git who claimed to be above all emotions , But he was a brilliant man, who hadn't done anything intentionally bad in my life and he did care in his own way. Like the way he would always looked out for Mrs Hudson. 

After the fall, he began to despise Anderson and Donovan even more, knowing that they too had had a part to play in his dear friend's suicide. Sure they were just pawns in the sick psychopath 's demented game of chess but they were willing pawns so John's resentment towards them was, in a way ,justified. But he wasn't going to act out on his anger. From what he learnt, doing that always seemed to bite him back in the arse. And he had already had enough baggage to deal with, thank you very much 

"" Yeah"" Mustered Lestrade as he took another gulp of coffee, to which John internally cringed 

' How do the Yard even stomach that? '

"" Anyway I will lead to the crime scene, unlike others, this one is out in the open for all to see so we had to make sure no civilians will get close to it, especially children, They will be traumatized "" 

Lestrade said, gesturing for John to follow 

The crime scene was, as Lestrade had said, out in the damn open for all to see. Three people, one woman and two men, were found dead in their puddles of blood. The scene was discovered by a elderly woman who were walking her dog in the early hours. 


oh poor her 


"" Well pretty brutal. Any comment, mate? ""

John crouched down to the cadavers, examining one of the men first. Wearing the gloves the Yard had provided, he slowly lifted the head up, careful as not to disturb any other part of the body. The body had started to enter the stage of rigor mortis but not completely so the death could have occured only around 4 to 5 hours prior. He did the same to the other two, and found the exact same result , through the woman's cause of death was hard to determine as she had bruises, stab wounds , head injuries and also marks of strangulation around her neck. The woman was dressed rather lavishly, but the old age of her clothes told John that she was nowhere near wealthy, this couldn't be a case of robbery as their wallets were all there, through none of them had their IDs unfortunately . 

"" Well, the death of the two blokes were most likely caused by the stab wounds,made  antemorterm . The woman ,on the other hand , is hard to determine as she has so many injuries of various kinds . This doesn't seem like a case of burglary as their wallets are still there and the woman 's jewellery is still on her.

' Though I don't think they would be much in value as they look fake '

"" Honestly Lestrade this seems like a case caused by violent impulses more than anything, "" 

"" I see "" Lestrade responded almost disappointedly. John felt bad that he couldn't be more helpful. 

"" I guess we- 

Lestrade's speech was cut off by the sight of another person who was definitely not one of his team staring at the corpses at the pavement. 

' A KID???? ' Lestrade internally screamed 

The kid was starting at the corpses almost in a trance. 

Feeling worried that the kid had just been traumatized, he rushed to pull the kid away from the crime scene to both preserve the scene and the poor child's innocence. Dragging the kid to where he and John were, he held the kid in place, hand firmly on both of his shoulders, already to give out a shock blanket. 

' How did a kid even get in here ? ' he wondered, hadn't his team already blocked out this area to outsiders ? 

"" Kid, are you okay.? "" He asked in a concerned manner, shaking the kid in an attempt to get him out of his presumed shock-induced trance

Surprisingly, the kid looked almost unfazed. He just stared keenly at Lestrade 

"" I'm just fine, Mr Policeman "" He started, almost too calm for a kid his age, glancing again at the slaughter in front of him, taking in all the details. 

"" I was just wondering if it was possible that the culprits were among the dead bodies over there "" He continues, pointing at the scene. 

"" What? "" Lestrade and John started, looking at the kid like he had just grown a third arm and a second head 

"" Well, I'm sorry for overhearing what the two of you were discussing earlier, Mr Policeman. But you said that nothing of value was stolen so burglary is out of questions. I think this would be what they call a crime of passion. Judging by the lady's lavish yet quite obviously old and worn clothes, we can see that she wasn't quite wealthy but liked to keep up the appearance that she was. Her death could have been caused by many things but I think strangulation is out of the way as the mark is not very deep in colour so maybe she got it while doing bedroom wrestling, judging by some of the light and nearly healed bruises on her waist. "" He proved his point by directing the two adults' eyes on the lady's waist and sure to his words, there were some bruises there but they were most definitely not made during the struggle. 

"" Which made me think that perhaps this was just a murder out of sheer jealousy. Maybe she was leading two guys on and one night while she was with one of her sweethearts, they bumped into the other and a jealousy fit ensured, ending with all of them dead. There were some traces of skins and blood on both men's fingernails , Mister. I think if you get it examined, it may shine some light on this "" 

For a moment, it was like the whole world had collapsed, that reality was no more than an illusion. 

The silence seemed to put the kid in a uncomfortable situation. Clutching his bag, he looked up in worry 

"" I d-didn't offend you, did I, mister? I am so sorry "" He said in a frantic voice

Being the first to regain his grasp on reality, John shook his head and smiled at the small kid in front of him 

"" Oh no - little lad, this theory of your is brilliant but how can you be so sure? "" 

Beaming at the accident compliment and further inquiries on his theory, the boy cheerfully continued, forgetting the anxiety he felt earlier. 

"" Oh, I found something near the alley there "" He pointed to the alley nearest to where the bodies were discovered, which wasn't even ten meters away and tugged at John's sleeve to guide him to the place. And guess what they found there, near the alley entrance , a switch blade and a knife, all covered in dried blood. 

Still smiling, the boy continued in a gleeful  manner 

"" I found them and thought that the murderer couldn't have possibly be dumb enough to dispose of the weapons here and why would they need two weapons anyway. So I came to the conclusion that the two weapons were used by two different people and were left here quite recently , seeing how new they are. The lady and one of men 's stab wounds were much wider and gappier than the other man's so I thought that the lady and the man were attacked by the other man with the knife, the lady was the first to go down and then the man pulled out his switch blade, which he must likely carries for self defense and started to defend himself, unfortunately both of them died in the process. And maybe during the struggle, their weapons got knocked out of their hands and flew into the alley.And for the lady , obviously she died due tothe loss of the blood and one of the wounds was over her lung so it wouldn't be a sketch to conclude that her lung got puncturee and she couldn't screamed for help "" The boy rambled like a mad man 

After he was done, both John and Lestrade were flabbergasted . Did a kid just solve a case for the Yard? 

' How the hell did the Yard not check the vicinity for the murder weapon? ' John thought, now realising that maybe Sherlock was right about how most of the Yard was incompetent. 

"" Wel- well thank you for your help and enthusiasm,lad. But where are your parents? "" John asked, almost too eager to meet the parents of this great child and give them a pat on the back for being able to create a kid like this, although he would give them advice on how maybe some teaching social norms would be beneficial. After all, the kid probably gave Lestrade a damn heart attack, if his face was any indicator. 

"" Lestrade, close your mouth, you are trying to catch flies, mate ? "" To which Lestrade did, but that didn't mean that he was over the shock. Turning back the boy, John cocked his head and repeated his question, this time more friendly, even crouching down to make him seem smaller and less intimidating to the young lad. 

"" I don't have one anymore "" The voice was so innocent and matter-of-fact that it took John a few moments to register it and gave meaning to the sentence. 

As though understanding the two men's confusion, the boy elaborated further 

"" Mother left me, I was going to head to the police station and then I saw you and curiosity kinda took over "" He said, somewhat embarrassed . 

"" Okay then"" Began Lestrade"" Will you give us some time please, lad "" And he pulled John aside, leaving the boy to wait.

"" I think we have a lost child situation "" Both men started at the same time 

"" And John don't you think this kid looks familiar to a certain someone? "" 

"" What do you mean, Lestrade? "" 

"" Uh, nevermind. We need to get back to the Yard to file up the report and examine the blood on the weapons ""

"" And the skin under the fingernails"" 

"" Yes that too "" 

 

 

 

 

"" And about the kid? We can't leave him here "" 

"" Well of course,we need to get him to the Yard and we will figure it from there. We try to find his relatives, if it's unsuccessful he would need a place to stay,although I don't think many of the yarders would want to let him stay with them for the night. A great deal of us don't have even a decent flat . Lost child cases have never been common here "" 

Finishing their conversation, the two men walked back to where the kid , who was now staring at the other police officers collecting evidence, was at. 

"" Kid, can you come with us to the Yard ? "" Lestrade asked, well it was more an order than a request. 

"" The yard? "" 

"" New Scotland Yard, it's where us officers hang out and file paperwork when we don't have to running around chasing criminals"" 

"" Okay, but can I sit near the window, Mr Policeman sir? "" 

"" Sure, kid and call me Lestrade "" 

The trip back the Yard was rather uneventful, aside from the unexpected kid sitting near the window, nothing was out of the ordinary. As John and the boy sat at the back, Lestrade was trying hard to focus on the road ahead of him but occasionally would glance at the kid. 

' Why does this boy look so similar? ' he ponder. An explanation hit him right in the head but he quickly shook it off 

' No, it's impossible, but then again considering his history. Is it really impossible?  I need to make sure ' 


At the yard 


While Lestrade was busy with getting the report and examination of the evidence done, John was left with the task of babysitting a kid. Not that he was complaining though. The kid had been quite well-behaved, just sitting beside him reading a document that John had given him to entertain himself. 

Remembering what Lestrade had said earlier, John took a good look at the kid. He looked strikingly similar to Sherlock, only that this little guy was blond , his face was rounder and with a smaller nose decorated with a few freckles. He looked like what Sherlock's kid would look like if Sherlock had had any interest in reproducing to continue the Holmes linage. But that was unlikely  ,this is Sherlock "" I'm married to my work "" Holmes. Even thinking about the possibility that Sherlock might have a secret love child was ridiculous , even for John. Whatever woman that managed to get him on deserved a standing ovulation  but then again seducing a corpse buried six feet underground is a bit far-fetch, hell even when said corpse had been alive , the idea was still too ludicrous . 

So caught up in his thought , John didn't even notice the two little eyes that was eyeing at him for the last two minutes during which conspiracy theories were being concocted in his head. 

Snapping back to reality, he found two blue-green eyes staring at him. 

"" Your eyes are pretty ,Mister "" The boy exclaimed gleeful, with a wide smile. 

"" W-what? "" He could only muster  usually no one paid any attention to his eyes, or him in general. He was as plain as vanilla ice cream.Usually it had been his arrogant detective that had caught everyone's attention,   whether enamored by his aloof beauty or frustrated by his sharp tongue and even sharper attitude, hell ,in many cases it had been both. 

"" Central heterochromia , I read about it on the Net when Mother was gone. It is condition where the centre of one's iris has a different colouring compared to the border, due to the uneven distribution of uh- what did they call it again - 

The boy put his hand to his chin, almost into a thinking position. John chuckled, contrasting sharply to the calm and almost unsettling impression he had had on John earlier, the being sitting next to him now was just a kid, no less than thirteen, eager to share what he learnt to anyone willing to listen. John almost couldn't believe this was the same one that nearly gave him and Lestrade a heart attack when he showed up at the crime scene  ,almost like a phantom. He almost thought he was in the movie The Shining. 

"" M-me-melanin, yes, it is caused by the uneven distribution of melanin, causing the eyes to have different color within themselves. I have never seen them in real life, aside from my own ."" Pointing at his own eyes,which were a mix of blue and green, depending on the light,with a sense of pride like any child would when discovering something unique about themselves.

"" Yours have a ring of gold shade around the irises. They are so cool"" The boy finished with a gesture at his own iris to empathize his point. 

John questioned how it was possible that anyone would abandon a bright child like this to fend for himself . People could be so cruel , even to their own kin

"" Y-yeah  I guess they are. Say, what's your name  little lad  ?"" 

' Might as well get to know him better ' he thought fondly 

Almost in a instant, the boy replied

"" My name is Arthur Miller , Sir "" 

Seeing a child so happy at a chance to talk with someone really tugged at his heartstrings  ,John always had a soft spot for children. They were , at their core,  innocent like a white sheet , whether the sheet would be painted with bright colours or drenched in black ink and then stomped is unclear. In the latter situation, there was a chance the cycle would continue 


Hurt people hurt people


He hoped Arthur wouldn't become like that. No children deserve to suffer at the hands of anyone , less so their parents 

"" Well Arthur, I am John Watson, you can call me John .Mind telling me something about yourself? Like age or whatnot ?"" 

' Yeah that is a good enough conversation starter '

"" Well I am eleven year and 4 months old, Mr John


' So young '


-. There is not much about me "" 

The kid was beginning to tense up. John had seen this more than enough. More often than not, when he was examining children or asking them about how things had been recently  they often had a hard time answering, whether it was because of interrupting parents always putting words in their children's mouths or just general anxiety a kid would have when facing an adult . Fortunately  he knew how to handle situations like this. 

"" Well let's start out small. Where are you from? "" John reassured. When faces with such a broad question, some kids can be a bit tensed so it's best to start out small with casual question to create a familiar atmosphere first. And asking where the kid was from would give them  ,at the very least , an idea on how Arthur's home life was. This was very essential. 

"" I was born here sir, in London, have been here all my life "" 

"" And what do you usually do in your free time ? ""

"" Not much, when I get bored, I try to keep myself entertained,reading books from the library, researching things on the Internet. I tried to keep quiet so Mother wouldn't get cranky "" The last part was said in a lower, but quieter voice ,which made John's face drop but he quickly put it back on as not to distress Arthur even more. 

"" What about you , Mr John? "" 

"" Well, I usually just go about my day . Reading books is also an interest of mine, though nowadays I don't really have much time . ""

' Since these days I have been too busy mourning my flatmate and been going insane from the bloody hallucinations ' that part was left out for obvious reason

"" Is it really true that being a doctor is hard,  Mr John? "" 

The question caught John off guard a bit 

"" Well it depends. And how did you know I am a doctor "" 

Arthur tilted his head a bit to the right

"" You have the smell of medicine but not the kind that used to preserve cadaver but rather the type used to treat common illnesses like headache, indigestion,... The tone you use reminds me of how some doctors try to cheer up children before an injection. Also there is a chemical stain on your jumper. It smells like disinfectant used in hospitals "" 

At this point, John didn't know if whether to laugh or to cry.He could only managed a choked chuckle .The kid was like Mini Sherlock, only more polite and definitely less walls built around him. 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

"" That was amazing. Brilliant even. You're a bright kid "" John said, suddenly remembering his and Sherlock's first meeting. Those were the good old days.Hearing the compliment, Arthur's eyes lit up like fireflies in the dark, a smile beaming on his face, making him look more like a kid his age rather than the kids with the unblinking eyes that came straight out of horror movies. 

Seeing the kid up close now, John noticed how weird his clothes were,an old t- shirt clearly meant for thirteen-year-olds and above , an equally worn pair of brown trousers, topped with a pair of brown shoes and a knitted cardigan, all of which looked a bit oversized for the boy and frankly speaking, they all looked so worn , with some of the colour already starting to fade from his beige T-shirt. All of that made him look so small, couple with the fact that he was a tad bit thin for a boy his height. 

John felt his fist tighten. 

' What kind of parents would abandon their children? Why did these people even have kids in the first place? Could they have bloody bothered to put a damn rubber on or maybe pull out in time or better yet have birth control on hand? At the very least take responsibility for what you did ' .

So many anger-fueled thought were filling John's mind . He should be desensitized with this by now. Back in Afghanistan, it was not uncommon to find dead mangled, even blown up corpses of innocent children. Sometimes, you would be hanging around in a village, chatting with the locals, giving the kids there piggy back rides, making small talks and then BAM the little lads you were just playing with were now dead, gone. They had had their lives taken away at a young age, most had their eyes wide open and their faces twisted into an expression of fear and pain. When this happened, you just had to suck it up and grab the nearest thing to make a make-shift weapon and head straight to battle, sometimes even stomping on the exposed guts or brain matter of some innocent villagers. It was quite literally bloody hell.

No matter how hard he tried, John couldn't get the images  of those children's faces out of his face , twisted in pain and their body mangled beyond recognition, with guts oozing out like spaghetti and organs littered near the place they died.

By and large, John should be unfazed by this and yet here he was, worrying about an unknown kid ( who looked suspiciously like his deceased flatmate, who he may or may not have seen as more than a friend. Had it not been for his sandy blond hair and round small nose , the yard would be swearing up and down that he is Sherlock's kid.Like just put a black wig on him and the whole yard would think there is a secret love child of Sherlock walking around in plain sight and surprisingly not deducing and insulting people simultaneously) and getting all riled up about the possibility of said kid being mistreated. 

"" Mr John"" The voice bought him back to reality 

"" D-did I offend you? "" Arthur asked with worry in his voice 

"" Uh yeah, I am fine , just got lost in Memory Lane, nothing important, lad. So anything you want to ask about me, lad? I take it that the conservation have been a bit one-sided so we might as well mix things up "" 

"" Well I do want to ask something  , Mr John. How come that curly- haired lady over there keeps staring at us? "" 

Okay that was not a question John was expecting 

Looking towards the direction Arthur was pointing, John quickly located the mentioned being, which was. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Donovan. 

' Great ' John thought unenthusiastically

As if noticing that John and Arthur were staring back at her stalking arse, Donovan cautiously approached. 

"" Lestrade needs you "" She said bluntly

John merely gave a hum in response , stood up and gestured Arthur to follow him. 

Just as they were entering Lestrade's office, a distinct sneer came from Donovan 

"" Didn't know Freak had a child? "" 

It took John all of his restraint as a soldier and his good conscience not to turn around and verbally assault Donovan. The urge was tempting but he knew nothing good would come out of this and God's sake there was a child here. 

Entering his friend's office, they were instantly instructed by Lestrade to have a seat , which they did. 

"" Okay lad, I will just ask ya a few questions okay? "" Started Lestrade, already with note in hands

Gaining a nod from the young boy, he began . 

"" What 's your name? "" 

"" Arthur Miller, sir "" 

"" Age? ""

"" Eleven ""

"" What school do you go to? "" 

"" Chester middle school, sir "" 

"" What grade are you in? "" 

"" I will be starting Year 7 after summer ""

And so on, so forth, questions were answered. Personally to John, the process was too mechanical and bleak, not to mention too much pressure being forced on a kid. He could tell that Arthur wasn't feeling too comfortable being interrogated like a suspect of a triple homicide. 

Fortunately, the interrogation was short . 

"" Well, that's enough for now. Thank you, lad "" Lestrade said, reaching into the nearby bowl of candies , grabbing a few pieces and gave them to Arthur who accepted them, though the look on his face indicated that he didn't like the lemon-chocolate favoured hard sweet that he received. 

"" John, can I have a few words with you, mate "" Lestrade said and pulled John outside, leaving Arthur who was looking at the sweet with a disgusted look, which was understandable, I mean who even had the idea to combine lemon and chocolate as a candy favour. 

"" What is it, Lestrade? "" John inquired, a bit done with being pulled aside to have a private conversation twice this day. 

"" Well, remember how I said that if we can't find the kid's relatives, he has to stay at someone's place for a night or two and how I said most of the yarders can't let him stay with them. "" 

"" Wait - you don't mean ""

"" Yes ""

""Lestrade, I am not even part of the police. How can I? Why can't you do it? "" 

"" John, please, I know this is all too sudden for you, well, us but you're basically the only one I can trust on this. To be frank, I don't trust most of the officers here and the ones I do, I doubt, they have the space and time to look after a child. And we can't leave him  "" 

Much as he hated to admit this, but Lestrade was right. Leaving Arthur here was a no no and John didn't think that he could trust the yarders with the kid seeing how Lestrade remarked that they had never had this type of case before. Normally lost children got reunited with their families within hours of arrival, but what can you do when said child's family didn't want him. 

And it's not like John couldn't handle a kid for a few days, sure he needed to work but the kid seemed to be able to look after himself for a few hours. But John feared that he may have a breakdown while at the flat and scare the kid away. The last thing he wanted was to be seen as a lunatic by a child. 

After a good while battling his turmoil, his inner goodness and inability to watch a child be left alone won out. 

"" Fine, I 'll do it "" John said, letting out a sigh

"" And for the love of God and everything holy Lestrade, rest for bloody hell's sake, mate. You look like utter shit"" 

After John left with Arthur, Lestrade took a sip from his cup of coffee. 

' Taste awful but it does it's job ' he thought and then rummaged through his trousers' pocket to pull out his phone, dialing a series of number 

"" Hey Myc, yeah I know, miss you too, I need a favour, something surreal happened today... 

If you told John a few hours earlier that he would be taking care of kid for the next few days, he would have laughed it off as a bad joke and yet here he was at the entrance to the building where his flat resided, with a eleven-year-old child. 

"" What am I going to tell Mr Hudson? "" He whispered to himself 

 

I can't bloody believe that I have made it this far. Thank you beautiful darlings so much

Arriving at Baker Street, John fumbled to get his keys. Holding onto Arthur's hand to guide him the way to his temporary home. The boy looked around the building, eye changing director like the spin of a helicopter to take in the new surroundings. 

"" It's okay Arthur, you will be safe here. No one in this building bites, well there may be a few noise now and again but nothing too much "" John reassured the small child beside him, who seemed to still be on edge despite his reassurance. This was reasonable, John remembered how shy and nervous he had been as a child, especially when in a presence of a new environment. The sense of the unknown had always gave him anxiety. 

Opening the door to the flat, John guided Arthur inside, looking at the oh-so familiar place, yet it wasn't the same without the world's only consulting detective. And somehow this was made even intense with the appearance of a small being that looked  so similar to Sherlock

' Funny how human genetics work' John thought as he rubbed his shoes against the doormat, removing all the dirt and filth, before placing them in their rightful place. 

Seeing this, Arthur seemed a bit confused but decided to mimick John nonetheless , first getting rid of the filth and then setting his shoes next to John's. 

"" Well"" John started in an attempt to break the awkward silence between them 

"" You want a cup of tea, lad? Or juice? "" Said John as he reached into the fridge to find the bottle of orange juice he had bought a few days earlier. Since now there weren't any organs or heads, of any species, lying around in the fridge, John was able to easily locate the bottle of orange juice. 

"" Tea, please Mr John "" Arthur  replied""  Can I sit here please? "" , pointing at one of the chairs in the living room, John's chair to be specific. 

"" Yeah sure, go ahead, Arthur."" 

Hopping on the chair, Arthur tried to make himself comfortable. All the walking had made his legs a bit tired , but that didn't mean that his mind was. Far from it, his mind was spinning around, taking in the details of the flat, connecting the clues to better understand his new environment and his new supposed caretaker. 

Despite still having some uncertainty towards John, he didn't think he would be much of a threat. To be honest, he thought John was friendly and nice to him, maybe even more than his Mother had been to him, even if he was dangerous, Arthur wouldn't need to worry, he had already mapped out an escape route and the pocket knife he had in his cardigan would come in useful. He may not be able to defeat an adult but with his small size, he could inflict some damage to his legs and then make an escape. 

' Of course, I am not going to do anything to harm Mr John, after all he seems nice ' but Arthur knew people can be deceptive so he had to be careful. 

' Better safe than sorry '

While John was waiting for the water in the kettle to boil in the kitchen, Arthur looked around the flat. 

' Seem spacious for a man to be living alone. Maybe Mr John has a flatmate or maybe a wife ' 

Moving his head around, Arthur looked up and noticed the room upstairs had had its door slightly open, enough to reveal that it was a bedroom. Lowering his head , he noticed the door to one of the rooms on the floor he was on was locked. 

Getting up and carefully stepping to peer through the keyhole, he could barely make out the outline of a bed in the dark

' So a flatmate then '

Quickly returning to the chair, Arthur sat down, pretending to have nothing to do. A minute later, John returned with two cups of tea in hands. 

"" Milk and sugar, lad? ""

"" Yes, please Mr John"" 

Nodding his head, John added a little milk and sugar to Arthur's cup 

"" You know that you don't have to call me Mr all the time, right? "" 

Arthur seemed confused before opening his mouth once again

"" Isn't calling someone significantly older than you Mr or Miss a polite gesture? "" He asked, scratching his head, ruffling his hand through his curly blond hair. He liked his hair colour, it wasn't like Mother's and from what he had heard from Mother about Father, it was the same case with him. Arthur felt a sense of relief, as ridiculous as it was, that he was , at least, different from his parents in that aspect. He couldn't have imagined turning into a junkie like his parents.He had already had enough defects from being a drug baby. He didn't need more. 

"" Well yes, but sometimes it can be a bit too formal "" John replied. Arthur liked the way he didn't treat him like a little kid unable to have a single coherent thought or worse, a pest or a mistake. He hoped that there weren't some deceptions involved . It would be a pity if there were 

"" But I want to show respect "" Arthur replied , slightly pouting . He always felt uncomfortable referring to people older than him without stating Mr or Miss or Mrs. It showed respect and a level of unfamiliarity, which was perfect. 

"" Alright, lad "" John chuckled, settling a cup of tea in front of Arthur. It smelled nice, unlike the bitter solution he had made with the cheap tea packets he had found at home. 

Lifting the cup to his nose, Arthur inhaled a lungful of tea, feeling a bit relaxed thanks to the calming smell of tea. From what he had learnt, tea has a calming effect on the nerves but when he tried to make it, the taste was so horrendous that he had to spit it out. That was probably due to the cheap and probably expired quality of the tea packets, plus his limited knowledge on how to make tea. 

' I need to learn more on this ' Arthur thought to himself. ' It doesn't smell drugged ' he thought as he took another whip of the tea . Taking a small sip, it tasted good, very aromatic and didn't taste funny. 

' Then again why would Mr John try to drug me? He seems respectable. Though I have heard that human trafficking can earn one a lot of money but again he doesn't look like the type of scum to do that. He actually seems a little sad , if his aura and the slump on his shoulder when he walks are anything to go by. Perhaps he has lost a loved one ' Thought Arthur as he drank the rest of the delicious tea. 

"" It's delicious, Mr John"" Complimented Arthur as he set his cup down. 

John let out a small smile, it was nice to be able to smile genuinely after months of possible insanity caused by his hallucinations and his thoughts. 

"" Thanks "" He said hesitantly 

"" No really, Mr John. It's better than what Mother made. Despite being so proud of being full British, she is never able to make a decent cup of tea or even cook"" 

John felt as if he was about to choke. The kid in front of him was talking about his less than ideal home life like it was nothing, which made him wonder what kind of shit Arthur had gone through to be so... unfazed. But he wasn't going to pity him. Sometimes pity can make a person feel even  worse than they already have. He could say that from experience. If anything , he admired the kid for being so strong. Not to mention how aware of the situation the kid was. Not many kids know where to head to when they are abandoned by their family. 

"" Y-your mother was not a nice lady  , eh? "" 

At least he could offer an ear to listen to the other's problems. An sympathetic ear can make one feel better by being able to let out their frustration. 

"" No, I mean she used to be but she got messed up. She used to care about me but not anymore. All about her boyfriend and "" Happy pills "" . 

' Stopping rambling, you idiot. You're over sharing ' The voice in his head shouted but his mouth just kept going. 

"" I hate her, I don't want to see her ever again. I WISH SHE WAS DEAD "" As soon as the words were out, Arthur covered his mouth. 

John looked so shocked, his eyes wide and mouth slightly agape. 

' Shit, he's going to get angry ' The irrational fight or flight response of Arthur was going into overdrive. Why did he have to share that unnecessary detail. 

' Oh god, he is going to think I'm a psycho, a demented freak. Why mouth? WHY CAN'T YOU SHUT UP FOR ONCE ? ' 

Arthur started shaking, held his hands to his face, ready to cry out a string "" I'm sorry- I'm sorry -I'm sorry "" over and over. 

Instead of shouts or hit that he was expecting to receive whenever he dared overstep his boundaries, John gently parted Arthur's hands from his face, which were clawing at his face so hard that blood was threatening to leak out. 

Seeing the bright kid who had been smiling at him so preciously a hour ago curling up in a ball , begging like he was going to be beat up and mostly likely having a full on panic attack, it made John feel even more angry about the kid's situation, he didn't do anything wrong and yet was abandoned by his family. Oh how he wanted to give his mother a piece of his mind, he wouldn't even hold back on the swearing. This was full on child neglect and abuse. John felt horrified and furious how people can do this to their kin, their kid nonetheless.

It's like they were less than an animal.Sure there are some animals that would kill or abandon their young if stressed or endangered but human were above that, they developed morals, sympathy. That's probably why they are so advanced compared to the rest of the Animals Kingdom. 

Finally succeeding in keeping the kid from literally clawing his face away, John quietly sat beside the kid

"" It's okay, I won't hurt you, you are safe. Keep breathing. Yeah that's good. Breathe in, breathe out, you're doing great  "" He reassured the little soul that he was safe, no one was hurting. It's what John wished people would do for him whenever he had war flashbacks, but after an accident where his colleagues had been too scared or disgusted to even approach and just acted like nothing happened afterwards, John decided it was better to deal with this in solitude. 

Slowly pulling Arthur into a hug, John gently pat his back, rubbing small circles on its middle to calm the young kid down. Despite the initial flinches, Arthur gradually sunk into the hug, his breathing slowly calming down till it was at a normal rate. After a while sitting still, the young boy's voice broke the silence. 

"" W-why aren't you mad ?"" He croaked, his voice all hoarse and dry from all the crying. 

And seeing this just broke John's heart, he knew the world was a cruel place, and sometimes it's the innocent ones that suffer, not the bloody tossers that always prey on the weak. Looking at the boy's scared, tear stained freckled face, somehow John saw his child self and many other children who suffered from mistreatment. He understood the helplessness and irrational thinking progress that everything was about to get them, harm them, torture them. It wasn't death that they most feared, but rather the long and likely painful way it would be delivered . 

Struggling to push through the painful sensation at the depth of his stomach, John began to open his mouth, ever so gently and carefully, in order not to distress the boy even more. Panic attack is a terrible, irrational thing, it 's a caged, scared animal, ready to lash out and attack or run away from any hands that approach it, be it a amiable or a malicious one. 

"" No, Arthur, I am not mad. Like I said earlier, you're safe, I won't hurt you"" His words, soft and steady, really had a calming effect on the young boy, or at the very least, had stopped him from falling deeper into the panic attack and risking hurting himself. That was the last thing John wanted. 

Still hugging, Arthur clinged to John more, almost like this was the first hug he had ever received, which was true, as least from what the young boy was able to remember. Mother's hugs were never for him, they were always for her string of boyfriends whom she would bring home and have bedroom wrestling or do happy pills. That were what she had told him to keep him oblivious but Arthur wasn't stupid, at least he hoped so, praying that whatever damn drugs his Mother had put into her body while carrying him hadn't affected his mental development . The thought of being mentally underdeveloped had Arthur sick to his stomach. He , definitely sure as damn bloody gutted hell itself, didn't want to be one of those drooling, brainless kids unaware of the world around them. In some fortunate cases, people would just take pity on them, some less unfortunate ones , however, those kids would be perfect target for child trafficking , which either resulted in them being labour slaves or sex slaves. Or get their organs ripped out and sold on the black market. 

' It's a miracle that Mother didn't abandon or kill me sooner. Good grace, what am I doing? Being a damn weakling, who breaks down at the slightest sign of misinterpreted danger. How can I survive being so weak? ' 

So caught up in his thought was the boy that he didn't notice that John had let go of the hug, leaving Arthur to start to cling to his own limbs. Pouring a new cup of tea, John held the cup up to Arthur, who was starting to tear up again.

"" Here, drink up, Arthur. You need to replenish fluid "" John said, knowing fully well that it was a lie just to get Arthur to drink the tea. It was a trick John had accidentally stumbled upon during one of his times researching as a med student. It is said by researchers that evolutionary psychology dictates that humans only drink or eat when they feel safe, whether it is about the things they are consuming or their surroundings. By making people have a drink or eat something when in distress, it can help trick the brain into thinking everything's okay, which can help a long way when one's brain is always screaming that you're in danger. 

John may not be as intelligent as Sherlock but he still knew many useful knowledge to aid him through his life, whether it was about being a soldier or a doctor. It's amazing how his medical knowledge could come in so handy when being a army doctor during his tours. Guess it's quite easy to defeat an opponent when you already know what a human's typical weak points. Sometimes it stunned John how a human body can be so fragile in some situations and resilient in others. 

Staring at the cup of tea, Arthur accepted with hesitation, his hands still a bit shaky, eyeing John almost in disbelief, his facial expression similar to the one John himself had made when this brilliant child had managed to speculate a possible story behind a case, while the Yard hadn't even bothered to check the vicinity for the blooming murder weapon. 

As the young boy slowly drank the tea, John noticed his sniffling had stopped, so had his hiccups. After having drunk the tea, Arthur lowered tea cup, which John carefully retrieved  and placed it on the table , before pulling out handkerchief to wipe the tears from the boy's face. While doing so, he couldn't help but think that the boy was so like Sherlock and at the same time wasn't. The boy was bright and clearly had a bit of deduction skills, yet he didn't seem - how should John put it - so aloof, so emotionally constipated, which was good because as much as John admired Sherlock, he really didn't approve of the late consulting detective's way of dealing with emotions. 

"" W-why? "" The boy started, a expression of disbelief and confusion plastered on his freckled face. 

John only managed an equally confused ""uh? ""

"" I don't understand Mr John. Why are you so kind to me? "" 

At that moment, John wondered what kind of hell had Arthur gone through to make him believe that he was undeserving of kindness. John hoped he wouldn't meet the kid's mother or else there would be another kill hanging over his head. 

Clearing his throat, he responded. 

"" Because you deserve it, Arthur ""

A simple response but enough to convey the meaning

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

After comforting the young boy for a good half an hour, just reassuring and telling him he was worthy of being treated with kindness just like any other beings. 

That is, until a noise startled them both,it seemed that Arthur was getting hungry, if the growling of his stomach was any sign. 

"" Want something to eat, lad? "" John asked, although he was pretty sure he already knew the answer. It was getting late, around 8pm and he was sure that Arthur wasn't eating well, given how thin he looked, especially with those clothes that were simply a tad too big for someone his frame. John decided the best action now was to get him fed and make him more comfortable for the time being. 

"" Y-yes, please "" Arthur muttered, a slight blush on his face as the embarrassment seeped in, clutching his stomach. 

Going to the fridge, John pulled out some eggs, cream , tomatoes and leafy green before reaching up to the cupboard to get the dried pasta and some herbs and seasonings. 

"" Is pasta okay for you, Arthur? "" John asked, to which Arthur just nodded, still a bit embarrassed about earlier. Starting up the stove, John bought the pot of water to a boil , dropped the pasta and brought out a pan to make the sauce. First cream, then garlic, egg yolks for richness, chives, salt and pepper and finally a little bit of mozzarella to add texture. For the tomatoes, he simply grilled them to get them caramelized , thus more juicy and easier to eat. 

"" You're really good at cooking, Mr John "" Arthur commented, standing near where John was finishing the sauce and draining the pasta. 

John jerked up a bit, wondering how had he managed to move so quietly. Maybe that was how he had sneaked through the yarders at the crime scene, either that or the New Scotland Yard officers were more incompetent than John gave them credit for. He hoped it was the former rather than the latter

' Honestly, this is impressive ' John mentally remarked, in his mind he was already forming theories on why Arthur moved so quietly

' He did mention that his mother gets cranky easily . Could it be -' thought John before shoving those ideas to the back of mind, where they sat along side his complicated feelings for the late detective, although some curiosity still managed to resurface. 

'Now it's not the time to question him, I just need to focus on getting food on the plate. He needs time to slowly open up.' Concluded John as him dumped the freshly boiled pasta into the sauce and stirred for it to cling to the pasta. While doing so, he couldn't help but wonder how the yard would handle the boy's case. If they are unable to find any relatives to take the boy in, he will go into foster care, which has like a 50-50 chance of it being better for him than his previous home. He felt his hand tremble as the imagine of Arthur going into a foster home where he is ignored, treated with indifference, only kept for the sole purpose of financial gain and good popularity. It was hard to laugh at the irony of the situation, how he had just met this boy for less than 24 hours and already cared for him, similar to how a parent would. John attributed this to his doctor nature, his need to take care of people, not to mention the subject of his worry bore a eerie likeness to the person that he used to spend time caring for, most often after cases involving fights. 

' Maybe I can take him in ' the thought appeared as abruptly as the acnes on a teenager's face. It was simple but there were too much things to consider. How can John, a single man living alone,be deemed as better for the job of taking care of a kid than ,said , a couple consisting of two people. Not to mention taking care of a child means making sacrifices. What if the boy grows to resent him. 

After a while lingering at that thought, John's mind decided to advance the ante and had him wondering about the boy's origin. 

' He has only mentioned his mother and not his father. Maybe he is absent. If so where and who can he be? '

A speculation popped into his mind but John quickly swatted it away like one would normally do to a fly, quick and forceful. It was silly and blatantly ridiculous to even consider that idea as no way would someone as married to his work as Sherlock would ever have had the desire to do it. Even if he had, not like Sherlock would be heartless enough to do something like this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, ? 

' No , he wouldn't. Sure the wanker had his own shortcomings and "" high-functioning sociopath "" status but he wouldn't be cruel enough to.. ' the thought was cut short by the smell of the dish being done. 

' Dear god, I am going insane '

Turning off the stove, John divided the dish onto two plates. If  in the near future his most terrible and abhorrent speculation is proven to be true , then John really needs to reevaluate how good he is at choosing candidates on whom he places his trust. But that was another matter for another day, right now his only concern was to make sure his little guest feel welcome. 

"" Food's ready, lad. - John said as he set the two plates on the table , before realizing he had forgotten to retrieve the utensils and turning to Arthur- Could you be so kind as to grab the utensils near the sink, Arthur "" 

To which, the boy quickly obliged, running to the sink to get the utensils and returning back to the table before giving them to John who organized them beside each plate of pasta. 

"" Well dig in, Arthur. ""

The rest of the dinner was a bit weird to John, mainly because he hadn't eaten with someone for months now, so he was a bit unsure about how he looked while eating, though he soon realized he didn't have to worry much as his company was only a kid, so no need for any too proper table manner. 

"" It's delicious, Mr John. You're a really good cook "" Said Arthur, who was devouring the pasta with much vigor. Kid ate like he hadn't eaten for days. Chuckling lightly, John pulled out a tissue to wipe the sauce that got on the boy's face. Despite the initial flinch, Arthur let him. 

"" Thanks ,Arthur ""

Despite thinking it was just an attempt to break the awkward silence, John accepted the compliment nonetheless. It's not everyday that he gets a compliment, given how plain he seems. After all, it was Sherlock who got all the attention  with his good looks, brilliant mind and equally dickish personality. Plus,it was good that Arthur was willing to talk and possibly open up more to him. In order to help the kid , he needed more information on him. 

 

After dinner and the washing up of dishes and kitchenware ( with the help of Arthur, who insisted that he help, despite John's numerous assurance that he could handle it himself) . After a minute of discussing, John gave in to the boy's insistence, deciding that this was probably his way of showing thanks. John admitted that it was endearing. 

After that, it was already 9:30 pm, which was a bit too early for him to hit the hay but he was too tired to wait another hour and Arthur, being a kid, probably needed his sleep by now, seeing how he had been yawning and rubbing his eyes for the past 10 minutes while holding his bags. 

"" Well I guess it's time to go to the bed "" John said to Arthur, who was halfway to dozing off while standing, jerk up. 

"" O-okay "" Arthur half-said, half-yawned, and started to walk towards the sofa, settling one of his bags down, before proceeding to hop on the sofa, using the other softer bag as a makeshift pillow. 

He was halfway to lying down on his back when John said 

"" What are you doing, lad? You're not sleeping here "", which seemed to startle him enough for him to sit up 

"" O-oh - his eyes looked down at the cold, hard floor - then am I going to sleep on the floor? "", his tone a bit sad but no trace of surprise could be found. It's not like he couldn't get a few shut-eyes sleeping on the floor, he had had worse. 

"" W-what- John quickly retorted to clear the misunderstanding , he looked disturbed at how Arthur came to the conclusion that just because he was told that he wasn't sleeping the sofa,he would be sleeping on the floor - You're not sleeping on the floor. J-just follow me""

Holding Arthur's small hand, John guided him to the bedroom upstairs, his bedroom. 

"" You will be sleeping here for the time being, lad. So get comfortable "" said John before walking to the closet to pull out a pillow and a spare sheet. 

"" Well you best go to bed now. The bathroom is downstairs and if you need anything, I will be downstairs too. "" With that John was out of the room. 

Staring at the decently furnished bedroom, so different from the thin dirty mattress at home that had been his ""bed"" ever since he could remember. Reaching towards the bed, he could feel the soft, bouncy material beneath his palm. 

' It feels nice and comfortable ' 

Sitting on the bed, he could feel how bouncy it was, unlike the deflated one back home. There was also no foul smell or discoloration that could make him rather sleep on the floor. Letting his body lay down on the bed complete, Arthur felt like he was dreaming , that any seconds he was going to wake up and be back at home, smelling the putrid smell of vomit, sexual intercourse and alcohol and hearing all the grotesque noise and the sight of the white mind-destroying powder and colourful pills. 

Grabbing his wrist, he pinched it hard in an attempt to "" wake up"". It had been nice, but if he were to stay in his dreamland any longer, he might end up crying for something that isn't even real when he wakes up. 

' Maybe the pain isn't enough ' thought Arthur as he bought the back of his right palm up to his mouth and bit down hard , enough to leave a slight mark but not enough for blood to leak out

Letting go and wincing at the pain, he saw that nothing had changed. He was still in a bedroom with a comfy bed and he was safe, at least for the next few days. 

' So it's real and not my wild imagination '. Lying back down on the bed, he succumbed to the softness of the material and dozed off to dreamland. 

Meanwhile, John was downstairs, pondering what kind of hellish life did Arthur go through. Remembering his expression when he had thought that he would be taking up residence on the hard and cold floor of the flat just made John want to punch the kid's parents even more. Who would even do that to a child? A monster that's for sure. 


She used to care about me but not anymore. All about her boyfriend and "" Happy pills""


'Drugs' concluded John, letting a sigh of exasperation. Oh how he despised this side of humanity. 

As a doctor, he had heard about many stories involving drug addictions of all kinds such as heroine, morphine, acid, hallucinogen, etc,.. within the medical community, but none of that compared to seeing the damage it caused for the innocent with your own eyes. Drugs, the illegal and extremely dangerous kind, can turn a kind human into a raging savage who would do anything to get their next hit to the point that that is all they care about, ignoring everyone else, even one's own children.Coming from a not so happy home life himself, John could sympathize with Arthur. The boy was strong and bright but abuse and neglect like that can affect anyone, especially children whose mind hasn't matured and so can be easily led astray. Children who grow up with drug addicted parents are said by researchers to have a high risk of committing substance abuse when older. The thought of the cycle being repeated in the future sickened John so he decided he was going to deal with that tomorrow. Right now, sleep was what he needed. 

 

 

 

Hello there, sorry for not uploading, schools in my country just started again so I am going to be a tad busy for next coming month. Apologies beforehand for the slow updates. I will make it up in length, hopefully

As the light of the sun shone through the uncovered window, Arthur groaned and rolled over. Instead of the short transition from the mattress to the floor like he had anticipated , he received a rather pain-inducing fall. 

"" Ouch what the hell ?"" He grunted, rubbing his side to ease the throbbing. At least that wasn't the only one he had. It took him a moment to clear his foggy mind and register that he wasn't at his home. 

"" Oh yeah"" He muttered, rubbing his head as he recalled the events of yesterday. To be honest, it was still a bit shocking for him that his mother would abandon him. As much as he hated his mother now, it was hard to deny that a long time ago, there had existed feelings for his mother ,other than hatred and resentment. Standing up, he reached for his bags, joyful to find that nothing was lost. Reaching into his knitted cardigan, he let out a sigh of relief that his pocket knife was still in place. 

' I wonder who thought of the idea for pocket knife. Did that person just one day think "" Hey, I want a knife that can fold into itself so that I can surprise my enemies. You think this is a piece of wood, bam a knife."" Maybe I will look into that later '

' People may think I am a deranged psycho for carrying around a knife but better have some protection than none, right? Especially in my situation ' thought Arthur as he settled the knife back into one of the pockets on the inside of his cardigan. which all seemed to be of a different material than the rest of his cardigan. They were worn pieces of scrap fabric cut and neatly sewn onto the cardigan for better holding ability , they even had  buttons used to close the pockets to ensure further that none of the contents slipped out.

' Good thing I know how to sew. I will have to admit I really outdid myself on these , thought I did pricked my fingers a great many times ' he smiled at the result of his meticulous and patient sewing while shuddering a bit from memories of the sharp pain experienced when sewing, feeling a sense of pride and like he was one step closer to proving Mother that he wasn't useless. 


 But what if you are??  


Honestly he thought it was weird how people were so adversed to carrying knives as self-defense weapon. I mean would be inconvenient for someone to accuse you of being a murderer just because you were carrying a knife. He hoped the officers wouldn't that gullible. But then again he had managed to sneak through a bunch of official police officers, all with badges and other authoritarian stuff, to get into a murder scene. Even Mr Policeman there - what was his name again - L-lestrade, yeah, even Mr Lestrade, a likely trained professional that had been working the job for years, indicated by his age ,posture and general familiarity with gore, had looked like he had just seen a ghost. Reminded of the event, Arthur couldn't help be feel proud for having been able to fool several police officers. 

Realizing that it was still early in the morning, Arthur decided to look around the room. 

' Dog tags, polished frequently, probably hold some sentimental value , so Mr John was in the military. No wonder he always walks like the soldiers in military documents' 

The though frightened Arthur a bit. Now knowing that he was in the same house with an ex-military, he needed to come up with a different strategy to fight back and escape if need be. No one knew Arthur had a knife on him so maybe he could aim at a vital organ or maybe go for the legs and slice the tendons. Humans can be so fragile if you know where to inflict damage

He knew that his thinking of ways to kill anyone that came close to him was a bit ridiculous and if not all but demented, deranged, psychotic and insane from a sane person's view.Not like he was in any potential danger, even if Mr John had wanted to hurt him, he would have done it in his sleep. And what use would he make of killing a child, especially when said child had been reported to the police about his abandonment. If Arthur were killed, his murderer wouldn't get off scot free easily. 

' Still it can't hurt to be careful ' the voice inside his head illustrated. The voice was annoying at times but it had saved his arse more than once so he didn't have much complaint about his anxiety for now. 

After all, Arthur essentially had no one to lean on. If he is going to be put into foster care, which is muchly likely, adoption, on the other hand, not so much, as few would want a child his age, too rebellious and stubborn, then he will run the risk of being used a tool for good population, a trophy that his "" caretakers"" flaunt to prove to the world how they are good-hearted beings to have the courage to take in a deranged child. 

Unfortunately, seeing how disappointing human kind can be, the public will, most likely, eat up those lies like a pack of hungry wolves spotting a juicy piece of meat. 

' Mr John has an a large amount of jumpers. He must love wearing them' Arthur commented as he spotted the arrangement of neatly folded jumpers in the closet. 

' I can't argue with that. Jumpers are comfortable and cozy, they are like hugs personified as clothes. I wish I had one '

Awakening from his restless slumber, John stretched his arms over his head and arched his back. Sleeping on the couch wasn't exactly comfortable but he still managed to get some rest, despite the minor nightmares. John was surprised that he hadn't waken up screaming like a madman during the night, which would be very awkward for him and Arthur. 

' I wonder how he is doing ' John thought as he slipped out of the sofa and walked upstairs. 

Opening the door to his bedroom, expecting to see the blond boy still sound asleep, to his surprise, Arthur wasn't asleep, in fact, he wasn't seen anywhere within John's vision. 


oh fuck


""Where the fuck is he? "" The doctor muttered, turning his head in all directions in search of the blond-headed boy, any signs of the head of curly blond locks. 

Scrambling around, lifting up the bed sheets and  pillows, opening up the closet and looking under the bed, John basically checked every nook and cranny for the boy. 

' oh bloody hellish fucking tossing shit of the motherfucking Lord of the damn above ' Cursing out every kind of profanity John had learnt during his army time, he realized that Arthur wasn't even in the room. Rushing out of the room, John was just, quite frankly, moment away from turning the flat upside down. 

' HOW THE FUCK DID I MANAGE TO LOSE A KID ?' 

Fortunately for him and quite possibly the flat , the sight of the blond curly hair came into view. 

' Oh thank god ' John let out a sigh of utter and utmost relief. That was like the second near heart attack he had had in the last 24 hours, and they were all caused by the same individual. What an accomplishment!! 

After the relief, John noticed someone was standing in front of Arthur. 

It was Mr Hudson, who frankly looked puzzled as to why there was a small child here in John's flat.

' Knew I would have to explain sooner or later ' 

Pinching the bridge of his nose, John approached to resolve the awkward and puzzling situation that was definitely causing both parties to feel very confused, although on Arthur's part it was more uncomfortable and uncertain. 

"" Hi Mrs Hudson "" John started, showing a smile to increase the chance of this going smoothly

"" I can explain "" he continued , pulling Mr Hudson aside to have a chat with her while telling Arthur to go freshen up in the loo and that he could find a spare toothbrush in a bag hanged on the door. 

After explaining Mrs Hudson the reason why Arthur was staying with him for a few days at least until they could locate any of his relatives.  He only talked about the accidentally solved a case vaguely as he didn't want another one making the comparison between Arthur and Sherlock.(*cough cough* Lestrade)His slowly going mad brain had already been doing a wonderful and fantastic job at that. 

' Honestly the kid's looks are similar enough, had not been for his hair and some facial features . Maybe I do need to go the loony house.'

"" Poor boy "" Mrs Hudson said, eyeing Arthur who was sitting on the couch, reading one of John's medical books. He was probably too absorbed by the book to notice the worried stare of Mrs Hudson, which was good. 

John only nodded in agreement with Mrs Hudson. 

I am back, my lovelies. Thank you so much for supporting me through the story. I appreciate it, hope you enjoy the rest of the story as well if not more than what has already been posted.

After having explained the situation of Arthur to Mrs Hudson, John might as well get the two acquainted. It might help ease the discomfort now being made by Arthur's relentless and unblinking staring, like that of a doctor preparing to perform a surgery or a pathologist doing an autopsy. 

"" Well Arthur- John started, pulling the two face to face, well more like face to chest or collar since Arthur's height was still that of a child- this is Mrs Hudson, the landlady- Mrs Hudson glanced at John- also not the housekeeper. Mrs Hudson, this is Arthur, the one who will be staying with me here for a few days. ""

Looking down at the small boy, Mrs Hudson flashed a friendly motherly smile

"" Oh aren't you just absolutely precious, dear boy "" She said, cupping Arthur's two cheeks still full with baby fat, thus making them extremely impossible not to pinch or in Mrs Hudson's case, squish. 

' Soft like marshmallow'

"" Nice to meet you too, Mrs Hudson""  Arthur replied, struggling to get his words out due Mrs Hudson's hold on part of his face. He still wasn't used to people being .............................................. kind to him. Being touched normally meant incoming hits to the body part being touched. 

The egg donor had suck awful taste in boyfriends. 

'Perhaps Father or maybe I should call him sperm donor, after all I have never met him and possibly never will, is even worse. God knows if he is even alive and has not, by some miracle, overdosed or landed himself in prison. '

The thought amused Arthur and he felt a bit too ecstatic for imagining his biological life giver's suffering. 


What if he is doing well and doesn't even know you exist ? 


That really got on Arthur's nerves, leaving his hands tighten into fists and his teeth grinding like he was chewing through a newly mauled prey . The thought of being essentially forgotten, it is even worse than being a mistake who only existed due to two people being horny and didn't think thing through, and also drugs. The idea that the fucking sperm donor was out there living life, hell, what if the fucker already had a family, partner and kids and all of that shit. If Arthur were to show up saying"" Hi, I am the accident that came from your one night stand with your fellow drug addict when you were high off your bloody mind "", the results wouldn't be good, not in the very least. 

' Can the word really be "" forgotten "" when your existence means nothing to them ? ' thought Arthur, that was another thing to add to the list "" Reasons why I may have parental issues""

Snapping back from his mind, he heard 

"" And you're so thin, we need to fatten you, boy. Put some meat on your bones"" Mr Hudson said, eyeing Arthur's appearance and deeming him to be in need of some good nourishment. That made Arthur look down at himself. His choice of clothes was off, but what could you do when you hardly had any clothes to alter between? And he was a bit on the thin side, though not enough to make his ribs poke out but it was still a bit concerning. 

It's not like he was picky about food, it's just that he couldn't stomach the nearly spoiled mush at home. 

' Poor boy needs to be fed ' Mrs Hudson thought and decided that she was going to bake him some goodies to fatten him up. 

"" As a matter of fact, Mrs H. I was just going to make breakfast for us. Would you like to join? "" John offered , already on his way to the fridge to get the ingredients. 

"" That's a delightful offer, John but I can't. "" Mrs Hudson politely declined. "" Still got some work to take care of. I only came here cause you have been so quiet yesterday. I thought-"" She closed her mouth before finishing her sentence 

John knew what she was going to say, he couldn't blame her for worrying too much. One of her boys had already died, so she couldn't afford another tragedy to happen. 

Saying a farewell, Mrs Hudson went off to continue her business, leaving only the two blonds in the flat. 

""Come on Arthur, let's go make some breakfast "" 

"" C-can I help, Mr John? "" 

"" Of course, lad""

After having breakfast (bacon,eggs, buttered toast and caramelized veggies), both of them sat on the couch , both trying to get used to the other's presence.

Arthur was feeling a bit uncomfortable, he never had breakfast often.

The conversation Mrs Hudson and John had had earlier had piqued Arthur's interest. Despite the lack of social skills, he could tell that the topic they were discussing was a bit on the sensitive side, due to the fact they intentionally lowered their volume so that he couldn't hear. He knew that he shouldn't get nosey but curiosity eventually got the best of him. After all he needed to better this new environment to avoid risking any provoking the people around here. 

' Now I think about it, I haven't seen Mr John's flatmate anywhere. And he looks like he slept on the couch yesterday ( indent on the couch, and the pillow and blanket on it confirm it). Why didn't he choose to stay in the other bedroom? Maybe he and his flatmate aren't close. '

Glancing at the furnishing of the living room, all the books, decorations, especially the skull that sat on the fireplace. It looked real and Arthur had to resist the urge to go and touch it to confirm his suspicion. 

' Impossible, the mingling of the furniture proves otherwise. Normally, people won't let their possession comes into contact with those of someone they don't trust. Insecurity, fear of thievery and being taken advantage of and the like. Then again the door to the bedroom is locked so maybe Mr John can't get in, even if he wants to. '

Recollection of the glimpse he got into he bedroom flashed before his eyes. 

'WRONG,  disastrously wrong. 'His mind shouted

' The inside was dusty.Even in the darkness, I could make out some of the dust on the floor and the other side of the door. So that bedroom haven't been used from some time now. What happened to his flatmate? They didn't move out that's for sure, the furniture and personal belongings were still there, in the bedroom. '

If you hasn't before then you maybe thinking that Arthur was peculiar and too aware for a kid. 

Due the lack of social interaction and loneliness, Arthur had developed this habit of keeping himself busy. Sometimes it was reading the books that hadn't been sold off with the intention of fueling mother's addiction, sometimes it was researching things off the Net in the local library, sometimes it was just going to the nearby park,  and see if anyone had left anything behind. Sometimes he would do that at school. ( he actually got his knitted cardigan that way and also a couple of jackets lying in his bags).

He never got caught, which was good. 

' Maybe the flatmate is dead ' the idea popped up in his head. 

' It's logical, and would like explain the aura Mr John is giving off, like someone who is in mourning'

Quickly enough, it was time for John to go to work. Seeing Arthur who had been sitting silently on the couch for a little too long, with his hands slightly raised and his finger tips touching each other, John decided to take one of his books off the shelves. The book was "" The hobbit"" , one of John's personal favourites

' I hope the kid likes this one, he seems to like reading ' 

"" Arthur, i'm going to go to work. Stay here and behave, okay lad? ""

Arthur nodded

"" Oh and here's a book to keep ya company. If you finish it early, you can grab another on the shelves . If you grow hungry, food is in the fridge. The telly remote is over there. OH and your clothes, I don't think I have any your size-""

"" I have a few in my bags, Mr John. ""

"" O-okay, well bye""

"" Goodbye Mr John, thank you for the book""

After John left, Arthur looked down at the book

""The hobbit"" He muttered 

"" Seems interesting "" And started to open the first page. 

On John's part ,  the work was as usual. The common cold, sprained ankle, sore throat, the like. The work was boring but fulfilling in a way, knowing he was doing some good curing the ill.After examining one of his patients,

' Stomach indigestion, typical '

John sat down at his table and lean back to get some rest.

Feeling his phone ring, he pulled it out. It was a text from Lestrade. 

It read:"" Bring the kid to the Yard at 3pm today. We need to do a DNA test "" 

"" Weird how they have already got a possible candidate "" John said under his breath. 

From what he knew, this type of cases usually didn't end with a relative being located. Being put into foster care was the normal outcome for case like this. 

Standing up , John headed to see Sarah his boss, to ask for an early leave. When she asked for the reason, John explained the situation vaguely, only telling the outline of thing, leaving out the fact said child in his care accidentally solved a case. 

Being kind and understanding, Sarah allowed him to leave early by two hours. John thought part of it was because they were low on patients today so what's the harm in allowing John to leave early to do some good. 

 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

As for Arthur, he was  back at the flat, nose deep in the book, reading each word with much vigor. 

It was more interesting than he expected, although he wished there had been more elaboration on the characters but this was a children book. 

Finally finishing the book after three hours of continuously reading, minus the time he had to close it temporarily to digest the knowledge that was dropped on him like a bomb. 

"" I kinda like this Bilbo fellow "" He muttered, a bit sad that the story had to end but then again, what didn't? 

After finishing the book John had given him, Arthur was, with all honesty, bored. Usually he didn't have any free time like this. He wondered if he asked nicely, could he go outside to gather some plants to observe. Back at home, there was a poison ivy bush growing near his house, he would pick some leaves( using a piece of paper as a barrier between his hand and the itch-inducing leaves) and make potion out of them, mostly just boiling them in an attempt to extract the substance inside that caused the itching and rashes

It had been silly but he had been only 8 or 9 at the time so his knowledge on chemistry had been rudimentary.He wondered if he had left them to dry out, would them still be as effective. If they were then it would be hard to distinguish them once mixed into dried tea leaves.

' That's a neat little idea' he thought, wondering if poison ivy would be strong enough to kill a person if enough was used 

There had also been mushrooms growing from the floor of his house. He knew it was due to the unhygienic circumstances, but they were still interesting to him nonetheless. 

He would pick them up, clean them, smell them, cut them open to observe the squishy inside, tries to see if he could grow more by planting one into the soil of the nearby park. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. 

It had been unclear to him whether they were poisonous or not. He had been tempted to pop one into his mouth. 

' If it's not, I will have something to eat, if it is, then I can escape this hellhole' was what he had thought at the time. To him, it was basically a win-win situation. And so down the mushroom went to his stomach. 

Fortunately ( for us of course ) , he only had a nasty urge to regurgitate, and he did. 

"" Maybe I should have put them into mother's food "" He said subconsciously while placing the book back on the shelf, considering the action seriously

  He decided it was best to move on to something else. No use thinking about the past

His mind wandered to the thought of all his new academic books for his year 7 in his bags, which were  gifted to him by the school since he was among the list of students living in poverty.

' Honestly we wouldn't be so bad off if she actually had some brain cells in her drug filled skull'

' Maybe I should get a head start in studying but it's so tedious sometimes. All the bloody formulas of mathematics. '

Despite being very capable of remembering those pesky formulas, he still groaned at the thought of doing things that were, in his opinion, not his cup of tea. He was more interested in human anatomy, biology, chemistry, medicine and lastly history than mathematics. 

He knew that mathematics is the very thing that helps human advance to this point of almost having mind-numbing conveniences. He knew the basics and everything required to work out everyday problems, how weird phenomenons can be explained with science and basic logic. 

"" Well that's enough over thinking for a day "" Arthur said, jumping off the couch and walked off to find something to do.

Back to John, he still had an hour left till he could leave, which was 1pm . Now was 12am , he still had about one or two patients left so it wasn't too hard. 

' Maybe i should seek out other place to work' he thought since this had become quite boring and mundane for him. 

' God that bastard rubbed off on me ' he thought, wondering how the dead could have such an impact on the living for being...........well dead. 

After all patients had been examined and diagnosed, he bid his colleagues and his boss good bye and gathered his things. 

On his way, he kept thinking of how he could get Arthur to share more of his home life prior to being abandoned. 

' He seems to be unaware of how devastating this kind of treatment is' John thought , remembering the tone Arthur had used when talking about his mother. It was cold, without any warmth, like when talking to a stranger. 

' Children coming from abusive or neglectful household generally don't grasp the full extent of their mistreatment, especially those who have endured this since young '

At least that was he knew about the subject. 

There were cases of the abused growing to become abusers themselves. It's ironic , in John's opinion, to become the one you once hated with every fiber of your being. In worse cases, they can have a complete breakdown, breaking their fragile psyche permanently

It's understandable that emotions can be unpredictable, it's the thing that can make us or break us. Emotions give us motivation to do things, but they can make us feel so crushed to the point of losing ourselves and grip on reality. 

John once heard a story from one of his military friends. When she ( the friend) was a teenager, a string of murder started happening in the neighborhood. The killer targeted women with blond hair, blue eyes, basically girls that were considered attractive. The bodies were mutilated, their skin ripped off their face, their vaginas stabbed with a, what the police assumed, kitchen knife,their breasts cut clean off and laid beside their bloody cadavers.

Turned out the killer was a girl, who was always shamed by her mother and father for not being "" perfect "", at school she was ridiculed for being one of the ugly ones. Due to this, the first time someone showed affection for her, she leeched on like a leech. Unfortunately for her, the guy only took advantage of her and then left. 

All of this broke her and she started to have the illusion that she could kill these "" perfect girls"" and get their most best assets, which were faces and breasts. She only left the breasts behind because they weren't good enough, in her broken mind. 

When the police caught her, she killed herself. 

The case was sad in John's opinion. It just made him feel both sorry and not sorry for the killer. Though he still leaned towards the idea that she should have been responsible for her horrible actions, a thought still lingered in his head 

What if they had gotten the girl help? 

What if she hadn't gone through all the mistreatment? 

So on and so forth, but it was quite useless to worry about the past now

And yet you're still hung up on him .His annoying mind taunted him. 

He quickly swatted that  input away, locking it in a chamber with lots of locks and chains in his mind dedicated to unwanted things, where it sat alongside some of his war memories and other complicated feelings and thoughts that couldn't be said. The chamber always had whispers and screams emitting from it but John could brush them away easily enough


"" First time? "" The other emotions and thoughts that John had previously locked away greeted the newcomer


 

 

Arriving at Baker Street, John walked up the stairs leading to his flat. He hoped Arthur didn't get bored being in the flat all day. 

Opening the door, John could still see the hallucination of Sherlock, just standing there in all his glory, trench coat, suit, scarf and all, staring through his very soul. He had been having these for a few months now. At the beginning, he would find himself waking up, carrying out an entire conversation with fake Sherlock, nearly forgetting about the suicide, until reality kicked in and Sherlock would vanish, leaving John behind questioning his sanity. Mycroft had revealed his supposed "" concern "" about John's condition. John wondered why the governmental official even bothered with him. His brother was dead, John had no uses anymore. Why choose to keep helping him? John would never understand that.

He even threatened to admit John into a mental asylum, which wasn't something that John took to. 

He was already considered pathetic enough, in his view, he didn't need another reason to hate himself. To please the ginger demon and possibly get some peace, John had decided to ignore all his hallucinations. Sometimes it worked with fake Sherlock slowly fading away, sometimes he broke down crying, mumbling incoherent noises and reaching for something sharp. 

Watching the vision slowly fade into nothing, like many times before, he called out for Arthur

"" Arthur, I am home. Where are you? ""

Sure enough, a head of blond locks immediately came into view

"" Ah, I see you have freshened up, lad ""

Arthur was now wearing a pair of dark grey trousers, a cream coloured wrinkled shirt. On the sofa, he could see the clothes Arthur had worn yesterday. Walking over to the sofa, John carefully picked up the pile of clothes, Hearing Arthur audible gasp and the hesitation to let him come in contact with the clothes, John said :

"" No worry, lad. I am just going to put them in the laundry basket for a wash"" 

Arthur maneuvered his raised hand down, feeling a bit red in the cheeks for having reacted so rashly, despite the fact John didn't seem to mind.

"" Well good news, Arthur. Lestrade managed to locate a possible relative of yours."" John said, taking off his beige overcoat to hang on the coat hanger. 

"" Though it is weird that you will need to do a DNA exam "" He continued 

"" Well mother never was close to any of her family members "" Arthur said, remembering all the time mother would drunkenly reveal a lot of her issues to him during her high, with profanity , sex, trauma and all. 

"" I won't be surprised if they try to deny my existence. ""

"" o-okay "" John let out, not knowing whether he should proceed with the conversation. In the end, he decided to push forward with it

"" Anyway, you are always about your mother. Mind if you tell me more about your father? "" John said gently

"" You don't have to, if you don't want to, Arthur "" He added, seeing Arthur's hesitant expression. 

"" No I want to "" He replied, after a minute of contemplating. 

"" Well - he started, a bit nervous, he had never had to to talk about father , he didn't even know what he looked like - I don't know much about father, he has never been in the picture. ""

Well, John's speculation was confirmed. 

"" I only know that he was mother's one-night-stand or one-night-fuck ""

John was a little surprised at how Arthur knew that word, okay maybe not much considering the kid's home life but it was still startling to hear that word coming from a kid. Maybe it was not that fact that he knew the word rather than how he discovered the meaning and the situation in which he learnt it. 

"" Whenever she was drunk or high or well both,- the images of numerous beer bottles and pill containers flashed before John's eyes, he wondered if this imaginary imagery of his was any close to the real one - she would cry and lament and blame everything in existence, blaming father, blaming me, despite the fact that I am sure that part of it was because of her horny arse "" The last one was said in a mutter but John still caught it. 

"" Sometimes she would force me to listen to her lamenting about how her passionate night with father was, how she should have used me to pin it again him and force him into marriage. She said he came from a rich background. 

Fortunately for the sperm donor, she never found him ""

Finishing his story , Arthur added a flick of both his hands, as if this was just a normal topic to come up in conversations. John 

John opened his mouth to speak but closed it again , rethinking his question again. Finally he said 

"" So, do you have any idea what he looks like? "" 

"" It would help with our investigation "" He added quickly. 

Arthur seemed to believe it

"" Well, Mr John, I only know what mother described to me. If I remember correctly and mother wasn't deliriously making things up, he has black hair ( though I doubt that will narrow anything), is tall and lean. But that could be anyone. "" He said, trying not to remember all the graphic depiction mother provided about his lower region. 

"" And what about demeanour? "" John asked subconsciously, honestly he didn't even know why he would be asking such a question. 

"" Oh mother never mentioned it, that's how she is, always saying how much of a bloody looker he was and how she should have trapped him to the old balls and chains. Though I do remember one time she said that he wasn't such a gentleman, but he made up in - Arthur shuddered at the exact words of his mother - other ways "" He said, hoping that John would get the meaning without him having to outright say it. 

And he did, indicated by his wide eyes and slight redding on the face

Can't believe I am already on chapter 11.Hope you all like the development of Arthur's character.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Looking at the time, John saw it was time for them to get going , can't keep Lestrade waiting. Putting on his overcoat again, he helped Arthur put on his cardigan ( it was cold out today despite being summer,and John's doctor instinct wasn't having a kid go out without any things to keep him warm). John didn't have any spare scarf for Arthur so he took a deep breathe and walked to his bedroom to grab a dark blue scarf that once had been in the possession of the world's only consulting detective. After his death, John had taken the scarf to his room. There were times he would cry into it until he fell asleep, times he would wrap it around his neck, pulling a tad too tight and contemplate whether he should do it. 

The option was so tempting. But he hadn't gone through with it ( lucky us), only because of his stupidly stubborn belief that Sherlock was alive. Another thing to keep him going is to see the day when Sherlock's name was cleared and he was in fact innocent.

Walking back downstairs, John pulled the scarf around Arthur's neck, wrapping it neatly and snuggly around the young child. 

And off they went to New Scotland Yard, catching a cab and instructing the driver about the location. 

Arriving at the Yard, they hopped out and came in the building. 

The place wasn't particularly crowded that day and most, if not all of the officers, didn't exactly bat an eye at the two blonds, few would give a quick glance, the more unsavoury ones would openly snarl, knowing how John had worked together with Sherlock on many cases. 

"" Hey it's the Freak's little dog again, look like he has got a mini Freak with him? "" One of the annoying officers whispered to his other colleagues, who all giggled, not knowing that John had heard every single bit of it. They only mentioned the mini Freak part because of the fact Arthur was with John, not because of his appearance. Those fuckers weren't able to get a good look at him, partly for the long scarf covering a portion of his face. But the single fact that he was with John was enough for their fat, greasy, donut-eating mouths to start moving. 

Glancing at the group of officers shit talking, he could see among the members there were Donovan and Anderson. 

' Go figures'

' Calm calm, peace and damn gutting quiet, just calm down John, you can do it. You're better than these fucking tossers' John reassured himself while simultaneously swearing in all the languages that he was fluent in, which was surprisingly lots for someone deemed as so painfully average and forgettable. 

' Honestly how did they even get this job? Those wankers!! Bloody fannies '

John was starting to understand why Sherlock had always complained of the Yard being filled with"" idiots with less intelligence than a primitive amoeba "" . He hoped that Arthur hadn't heard any of that. 

They quickly their way to Lestrade's office. 

They met Lestrade at his office, who was actually looking better than yesterday, he no longer had the crow nest of a head and bloodshot eyes. 

'Well he doesn't look like total shit anymore ' thought the two blonds. 

He guided they to where Arthur would take the DNA exam

"" Where's the candidate? "" John asked, seeing that there was no one in sight beside them and another person who would be taking Arthur's blood sample to send for examination. 

"" Oh- he is busy, he has already given us his blood sample. "" Lestrade answered, scratching his head. 

' he? ' John thought

"" Who is this guy supposed to be in relation with Arthur? "" He asked. 

"" Well he is speculated as his uncle but it needs to be confirmed "" Lestrade quickly replied, almost as if he had expected John to ask

"" And what can he do for Arthur's situation ? "" John pressed forward, honestly not trusting this supposed uncle, especially if the wanker couldn't even come here and see his nephew's face for himself. 

"" Well-well, we're looking into it "" 

And no other additional answers were provided for the rest of the procedure. No matter how he asked, Lestrade would just clam up, saying that they were still looking into it. 

After the procedure was done, they were informed that the result would come in after a few days, so in the meantime it was decided that Arthur would keep staying with John. 

""So do you wanna to go anywhere, lad? It's still quite early "" John asked, looking at his watch and realising that it was only about 5pm.

Looking up in the sky, Arthur thought for a moment. 

"" Can we go to the park, Mr John? "" 

"" Of course""

Arriving at the park, John sat down on a nearby bench while Arthur went around , taking in the view. He had never been to this park before. It was greener than the one he had gone to. 

Meanwhile John looked around the park. It had been a while since he had been out this much. Truth to be told, he had been burying himself in work and in his extensive  mourning to even find the energy  and motivation  to go out. His mind began to wonder what would happen when the DNA result came. 

He didn't trust this supposed uncle of Arthur at all. I mean who would even not bother seeing the face of unknown close relative. Not to mention that Arthur had said that he didn't know any family members besides his mother. 

' Surely this can't be one of those human traffickers. One can't simply be that stupid. It's like be willing to get caught by the police ' John thought, glancing at the small frame of Arthur, making sure he hadn't gone so far. The young boy was poking at the ground with a stick he had found nearby. 

' And if the guy really is Arthur's uncle then can he really help him? What if his whole family is fucked up? What if his family doesn't accept him?' 

Ah yes the caretaker's instinct was kicking in yet again. 

Standing up, John started walking towards where he last saw Arthur with the intention of checking up on the boy, after all he hadn't seen a sight of the blond head for the last 25 minutes now and he was beginning to feel anxious. 

Turning around the trees with their uneven branches and overgrown roots , he searched for any signs of the boy, occasionally yelling his name in hope of catching his attention. To everyone else, he probably seemed like a dad looking for his overactive son that managed to slip out of his sight when he had least expected it. 

If you paid attention, you might even see some parents nearby chuckling sympathetically , with the "" Yeah we all have been there"" look on their faces. 

John, however, was too focused on the task at hand to notice it. 

Arriving at the less populated area of the park, John finally found Arthur leaning against the trunk of a large tree. 

""Arthur, there you- John stopped when he registered the soft whimpering, bruises and scratches on the boy's face. His cardigan had been made worse by the appearance of some brown spots, most likely caused by dirty, other than that he seemed alright. 

He quickly got closer, worried that Arthur was hurt. Crouching down to Arthur's level, he slowly reached for his face, cupping it gently before slightly raising it up for easy examination. 

' Face slightly bruised and scratched, still some evidence of dirt, probably from face colliding with the ground. Dirt got in eyes. Slight dirt and leaves in hair'

Next to check were his arms and legs. Trailing his eyes downward, John noticed a little bump rising up from the midsection of Arthur's cardigan. It was moving, wiggling upwards. 

A yelp startled John and out popped a little kitten, full black with the only exceptions being a third of its face, on the right , being orange and its front paws being white(as least from what John could see since it lower half was still nested in Arthur's cardigan)making it look like the creature was wearing tiny socks. Upon closer examination, he noticed the small feline was bleeding a little from its left front leg. 

' So the whimpering was from the cat ? ' thought John, a bit relieved that it wasn't Arthur  

Reaching for the cat, John was caught off guard when his wrist was soon held in place by Arthur's hand. 

""Don't-don't hurt i-it, please"" He pleaded, in his eyes John's image was beginning to fade out and be replaced by that of someone less merciful of small unexpected creatures appearing in front of them. 

"" P-please, just d-don't "" He repeated

 

 

Writing this has made me realize how fucking wild my imagination is .You may realize this by now but I just love having the characters' thought process and inner turmoil be heard. The narrative is a mirror, reflecting the characters' inner thoughts.I hope this doesn't get on your nerves.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          






Mother was never kind to him these days or ever. 



"" What the hell do you have there, brat? "" She spat out venomously, almost like one would to a convicted felon, eyes once intelligent now were nothing but dimwitted 



"" A dog"" Arthur replied, managing not to choke on his own words. He had only wanted to help the poor canine. Eyes widened in anger and reddened from all the drugs and alcohol, the woman yanked the dog out of Arthur's clutches, still yelping and weeping in pain, and threw it out of the door. The poor dog landed a bit harshly but was lucky to still be able to run away, albeit with a noticeable limp



' No broken bones ' noted Arthur, glad that at least the dog would live another day, in peace at least. Unlike Arthur, who was about to face yet another onslaught by the hands of the being that was supposed to care for him. 



"" You listen you fucking dirt face, we already have a pest in this house- she said, pointing her long fake nails accusingly at Arthur, almost making contact with his face, especially the freckles he was quote-unquote "" cursed"" with, and then pulled away a mere second later like he was evil reincarnated



'Narrow-minded fanny.Don't even know that freckles are a natural occurrence, not some bloody voodoo magic of the damned ' 



' Well, maybe you shouldn't have been such a cock sucker and should actually have taken birth control. And better yet, not have sex when high as a damn kite on a windy day. But no you had to get your bloody cunt filled with bloody fucking sperm, eh? ' was what Arthur wanted to retaliate with but he knew better. He had to keep the facade of being oblivious lest he get beatened and starved, more often that is. It's great he didn't stand out so much and could easily blend in the background when needed. 



' Probably think I am retarded or some shit ' he thought bitterly. Despite not showing any signs of mental underdevelopment and always getting good grades in school (' not that the egg donor would care ' thought Arthur, remember the fact that she had never attended even one of the many parent-teacher conferences) , the woman would always call Arthur"" stupid"", ""idiot "", "" retard"","" brainless"", "" fucking mistake"", "" dirt face""



' Impressive how she manages to pronounce all of them right and yet always slurs when she speaks.Must be the drugs getting to her brain. Honestly, it's like all the pills and drugs have sucked out all of her brain matter' he commented. His biological birth giver was no more than a damn ditzy, brainless whore going through a string of boyfriends in the span of one night. 



 He shuddered at the thought of being anything like her or the sperm donor. The egg donor was once a brilliant lady, with a bright future



' Too bloody bad she gave it all up for drugs '



Sperm donor, on the other hand, wasn't known much by Arthur, other than the fact that he fucked egg donor, thus resulting in him being born into this barren, loveless household



' I would rather die than become like them' Arthur concluded strongly



' Hell, I don't even know what that dickhead looks like' 



And Arthur didn't intend on finding out. Sure he like mysteries but this was no interesting one, just a plain and sad one. Two people shagged, the lady got pregnant, birthed child, the child got neglect. 



' What will come next? Me becoming a damn serial killer ? ' he lamented his own fate 



By the age of 8 maybe even 7, Arthur already had known all the swear words and profanities there were in the book. He liked using the terms "" wanker"", "" tosser"","" fanny "", "" bollocks"".He still knew some of the more offensive ones,sex-wise and race-wise, but he didn't like using them much due to their severity.



After the verbal bashing and a few slaps to the face, Arthur quietly walked back to his small room, not able to find a silver of emotions for the woman that wasn't hatred, bitterness, or resentment. He had long stopped caring about her. 



 Cleaning the floor the best his then little 9-year-old hands could, he proceeded to prop his body down on the floor, not bothering or wanting to get on the dirty mattress less than a meter away from him. He closed his eyes, used his hands to try and shut out the moaning going downstairs. He really hoped he wouldn't be getting a half-sibling. They didn't deserve the same fate he was enduring. 


This is why some people just shouldn't be parents.

Now back to the present

Arthur, still holding John's hand in place, ( he was surprisingly strong for a kid of course but John could easily overpower him if he wanted but then again he wasn't a heartless bastard, plus, he actually had morals ), continued pleading John not to hurt the poor creature, that he would just help it and then it would be out of John's sight, all the while holding the little kitten close to his chest, fearing for the little creature's life and also his own. Seeing how John's fists tighten sent him more into a panic attack. He was dealing with an ex-military man, who knows what he was capable of. 

In actuality, John wasn't even mad or upset at Arthur. All his anger was directed to Arthur's ""parent"".

' Hell, that bitch doesn't even deserve such a damn title ' deemed John, honestly wanting to punch the living daylight out of the kid's parents. The mom was sure to receive a sock in the face for neglecting her child to the point of abandoning him in broad fucking daylight. Despite being raised to always respect women, that women were never able to do any harm( what bullshit) , John was still a firm believer in the lifestyle of "" Don't care what you have in your pants,mate if you're a dick, you deserve a kick, preferably in the face or crotch "", though in this situation it should be ""kicks"" 

In the midst of his rambling, Arthur didn't notice that the curious little furball in his care had dropped out of his yellow cardigan. Rolling down the track that was Arthur's legs, the kitten uncurled itself from its ball-like position and looked up at John with its forest green eyes. 

As the little bundle of softness reached for the doctor, he instinctively picked it up, first sliding his hands under its armpits and gingerly lifted it up to his eye level, getting a small ' meow' aimed at him. 

No sooner had John lifted the little creature into his arms than Arthur opened his eyes wide, realising that the kitten was no longer snuggled up in his cardigan.

""Don't- began Arthur in a shaky voice, toe the line of being almost jelly-like. 

"" Lad -John started with a gentle voice, lowering himself more in a subconscious attempt not to frighten Arthur more - I am not going to do anything to the kitten, except nursing it back to health of course "" He finished with a light chuckle, glad to see that Arthur's expression was lightening up.

"" Come on, Arthur. Let me get you cleaned up first "" John said, pulling out a handkerchief ( glad he brought it along) and rubbed the dirt off Arthur's face till he could clearly see the little boy's freckles once again. Next up was pulling the leaves and twigs out of his curly locks, which unexpectedly didn't take so long. Padding off any dirt on his cardigan and trousers, John helped Arthur stand up. 

"" Now mind telling me how a kitten managed to land in your care, lad? "" 

Looking down in slight embarrassment, Arthur began:

"" I-i was looking for plants to observe- Arthur scratched his head in embarrassment. At school, he was considered weird because of his fascination with collecting, observing, and dissecting, fortunately, he often blended in( just another figure in the background)so well that most if not all would just forget that was him. It was one of the many ways he had avoided bullies- I was picking up some snails near a bush and then I saw a bunch of kids, more precisely four- he raised four of his fingers for greater emphasis-, about twelve years old to fourteen years old, throwing pebbles at the poor kitty. I asked them why they were doing that. They said the cat was bad luck and why anyone would miss bad luck. I couldn't let them kill it so I snatched it off the ground and ran off, diving into a bush to hide from the kids.- looking at the ground, he grinded his teeth together- Why those morons would believe in such superstitious gibberish is beyond me "" He said the last sentence in a mutter but still audible enough for John to make it out. 

' Well I am starting to lose hope in humanity ' John thought, absolutely baffled as to why anyone in this time and age would still believe in such nonsense. 

"" I didn't do anything wrong"" Arthur quickly added as if he would be blamed had he not done so. 

"" No, you didn't, Arthur. You did the right thing, lad. Now let's go, we need to buy some stuff for our new little furry guest "" John exclaimed, ruffling Arthur's hair into a puffy mess and letting him take hold of the kitten once again. 

"" Hold its injured leg out for me, please lad? "" John said, pulling a small piece of cloth from his handkerchief. 

"" Okay Mr John"" Arthur replied, doing as he told. 

The small kitten hissed a bit in pain but allowed it nonetheless. 

Looping the cloth around its bleeding leg, John tied a moderately secure knot in hope of not causing it much discomfort. 

"" There, that should do until we get back home and fix the fella up for good ""

Thankfully, a local pet shop was nearby. Walking into the shop with Arthur walking closely behind, John requested a small bottle of disinfectant made for pets and a bag of cat food. 

' I already have bandages and cotton back at home so no need to buy that '

"" Having some father and son time, eh, mate? "" The shop owner asked, a fond smile appearing on her face, giving her a motherly vibe. 

"" U-uh yeah "" John lied, knowing that doing so was better than risk saying no and causing any suspicion on why a grown man was being accompanied by a child that wasn't related to him. Misunderstanding can lead to some very disastrous situations and John wasn't in the mood for any of those. He figured that it was the hair and nose that were making them seem related. 

"" Well make sure to make the best use of these years, kids you know, they grow up so fast, "" The shop owner said fondly, packing up John's purchase before giving it to him with a warm smile

John breathed out a thank you, giving her a friendly smile before bidding her goodbye. Arthur also waved back a goodbye to the lady who waved gleefully. 

' The kid really inherited his dad's smile' she thought before turning around to help another customer who was looking for the perfect brand of food for her picky eater of a parrot. 


Bonus part: a doodle I made of Arthur( i tried guys but at last I am no artist)



 










Hope you enjoy the little flashback, I hope to include them more to give all the characters more depth. It will be a while before Sherlock shows up so buckle up for the ride, my lovelies. And also hope you like the little doodle I made after finishing my exam early

' I hope Mrs Hudson won't mind having a cat roaming around the flat. She has never mentioned any policies against having animals in the flat. ' John thought as he recalled when he first moved into Baker Street. 

Arthur was looking down at the little feline all snuggled up in his cardigan, purring and kneading at the fabric of Arthur's clothing. The creature looked no more than 3 months, its long tail all curled up around its torso. 

On their way home, the kitty would occasionally get a little antsy and start to climb out of the cardigan, either to claw its way to Arthur's head or onto the pavement. Fortunately, they managed to tuck it back to safety before its small head hit the cold, hard concrete underneath. 

Arriving at the flat, John dug through his belongings to pull out a med kit. Reaching into said item, he pulled out some cotton balls and bandages. 

'First, disinfect the wound' 

Soaking the cotton ball in pet disinfectant, he gently dabbed it on the kitten's wound, earning a light hiss from the creature's pink mouth adorned with small yet piercing fangs and a few thrashes in a vain attempt to wiggle it's way out of Arthur's hold. 

After a few minutes and an near assault straight to John's face later, the two of them managed to patch the kitty up, which was now sitting on the sofa ,innocently licking its paw, like it hadn't been an absolute menace to deal with a few moments ago. 

"" You prat "" John said jokingly to the cat taking up residence on the sofa with Arthur sitting beside it,scratching its soft underside.

"" You nearly did a number on my face ""He added, feeling his face for any scratches that he was made unaware of 

Relieved that was none, he relaxed. 

' Injuries on the torso and limbs are easier to cover than ones on the face ' he thought, clutching his right arm. Still stung a little. 

"" Arthur, can you go to the sink and grab a bowl for me, lad? "" To which Arthur gladly obliged, nodding and letting go the soft puffball and heading right to the kitchen. 

John pulled a specific brand of cat food that the shop owner had recommended to him. 

He figured that from an outsider's perspective, this would look eerily domestic, like father and son adopting a pet. 

While he did admit that he liked taking care of people, he feared this would all be temporary. That in a few days, everything would go back to "" normal"" , with John coming home to an empty flat and having to face the illusion of Sherlock that his mind had made, with no one to remind that the Sherlock standing in his flat was not real, that Sherlock wasn't telling him he meant more to him than in actuality( oh how John wished), that Sherlock wasn't telling him to follow him, eyeing the window of the flat or the drawer where John kept his gun and looking back at John, with that bloody knowing grin, showing exactly what the doctor thought the madman was hinting at. 

"" Look at you now John. Taking care of a dull child. How boring "" Fake Sherlock sneered, standing in the hallway in his dressing gown, hair and face looking like he had done an experiment or two. 

' Sod off' John thought, ignoring the abomination that his deranged mind had projected. 

He feared one day he might listen to what fake Sherlock had to say. 

Fake Sherlock was as much of a dick, if not more than the real one. 

"" I am real, John.You know it "" The illusion scoffed back, crossing his arms 

John honestly didn't

He shook his head lightly, relieved to see that when he opened his eyes, Sherlock was gone. 

' Guess I get to keep my sanity for another day' he thought humourlessly 

Seeing Arthur returning with a bowl, John tore open the bag and poured it into the bowl. The rattling of cat kibbles landing into the bowl caught the feline's attention and it started charting towards them, meowing its head off. 

"" Here you go, kitty"" Arthur said, placing the bowl, whose content was quickly being devoured by the cat. 

""Mr John, what is going to happen to kitty? "" Arthur asked 

"" Us nursing it back to health "" He replied, putting the kettle on the stove. He was in great need of a cuppa. 

The rest of the night went on as well as it could. 

In morning, John was up making breakfast when Arthur came down, still a bit sluggish and dozy after awakening from his slumber. 

"" Why didn't you sleep in the other bedroom, Mr John? You look horrible."" He asked absent-mindedly

John froze, he never told Arthur about Sherlock's bedroom. 

""W-what? "" Managed John

"" Your flatmate's bedroom, I am sure he wouldn't mind "" Arthur replied, still a bit too sleepy to acknowledge the fact that his mouth was slipping too much

His response astonished John even more

"" How did you? "" 

Still sleepy and not hit by self-realization that he was showing his other side that he rarely put on display. It always managed to freak people out. 

"" The flat is too big for you, a man living alone, to need or even want, given your humble appearance and personality,not to mention it is in the centre of the city. I assume you have a flatmate. Yesterday morning, I noticed you had slept on the couch, indicated by your hair,posture, pillow and blanket on the couch. At first I thought it was because the two of you weren't close but the style and arrangement of furniture here said otherwise. One would never want their belongings to mingle with those of a being they don't trust. The inside of the bedroom was dusty so perhaps he hasn't been home for a while .-

Looking around the flat, John realized that every one of Sherlock's belongings were still here, every single one taunting him about the death of the detective. 'Yesterday I noticed a dressing gown, made for male.It was too big for you so I concluded your flatmate was male -'

As if his brain had finally flipped on the emotional intelligence switch , it dawned on Arthur that he was getting too comfortable around John, letting out useless speculations like that. They were correct, going by John's reaction.But it was basically asking for a ridicule or worse, a beating. 

Arthur managed his best not to tremble, reaching into his cardigan to catch a feel of the pocket knife. Despite knowing he was safe, his body just decided that danger was near and he needed to go paranoid. 

"" Brilliant"" was not the reaction he had expected, even without the additional anxiety. 

"" W-what? You're not mad or annoyed"" It was Arthur's turn to be confused. 

"" Of course not, well surprised yes - John began, walking towards Arthur and crouching down- but I am not angry, I told when you came here that you would be safe ""

"" Sorry, Mr John"" He said instinctively, he always made sure to apologize for whatever it was that was upsetting anyone. No one ever bothered to tell what he did wrong.

John's glaze softened

"" You don't need to apologize, Arthur. ""

"" Do you want to talk about your flatmate, Mr John? "" Arthur asked, noticing the choke John forced down, like he was going to say something and then decided not to. 

"" It's too sensitive for you, lad ""

A bit indignant, Arthur said back:"" Mr John, you have already witnessed me having two breakdowns. I know more than the average kid should ""

The man had done so much for him these last few days, the least he could do was offer a sympathetic ear. 

' Maybe he loves the flatmate ' thought Arthur. ' that would explain so much. Maybe he died and Mr John never had the opportunity to confess his feelings. Unrequited love perhaps? Seem possible ' 


 I don't want you near any of those filthy sinners 


The egg donor's voice echoed within the premises of his skull

' Wrong'

He always thought the hatred was unnecessary and frankly disgusting. The world was overpopulated enough as it was, with all the accidental babies here and there, him being one himself.What was wrong with letting people love freely? To Arthur's mind, who you shag didn't matter nearly as much as your personality. 

John let out a chuckle , one he hadn't had the privilege of having for some time now. Arthur thought he should laugh more. 

"" Well you ask for this, lad. Just don't blame me when you get traumatized "" Setting up another chair to sit on, John began:

"" His name was Sherlock Holmes and he, despite being an arrogant dickhead, a genius with no people skills whatsoever , was the best thing to happen to my life""

"" How does one be arrogant and still be considered in good light by anyone? "" Arthur muttered but going by John's uproarious laugh, he probably overheard it

"" That's what I thought too. But he just made me feel alive again, he saved me in a way. I wish I could have done the same. "" John began to choke up, Arthur tried to comfort him like he had done for him, placing his hand on John's forearm, to which John immediately jerked back due to the sharp sting

"" So-sorry lad, I got startled. That's all "" John lied through his teeth. 

"" Now eat up your breakfast before it gets cold""

A meow interrupted their conversation

"" I guess kitty is also hungry "" John remarked as he saw the little furry head popping out, stretching its petite body,its claw on full display. 

"" I will take care of it, Mr John "" Arthur said, snatching the cat food to go feed the hungry knife retractor. 

He wondered how long this would last 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Getting Mrs Hudson to agree with the cat staying here wasn't as trialing as John had imagined. Once she saw the puny little puffball popping out it's head and meowing at her, showing its tiny squishy toe beans , Lord knows she couldn't resist such cuteness. 

"" Fine, you can keep the little fur ball in the flat but remember to take care of it. I am not your housekeeper, dear "" She said, pointing a finger in a teacher-like manner to John, who was nodding sheepishly, just glad that he managed to overcome this trivial trial. Turning back to Arthur, she pulled out a small bag of cookies. 

"" Here dear, have some goodies, you need some fattening up "" She said, pinching Arthur's soft cheek

"" Thank you Mrs Hudson"" Arthur replied, practically beaming. 

Something about this scene just warmed John's fractured heart. 

"" Why would you take such an interest in such a dull and predictable pest? Surely I am much more fascinating"" Echoed the illusion taking the imagine of the dead as he stood near the innocent kitten napping soundly, face twisted into a snarl, before averting his attention to Arthur already with a chocolate chip cookies hanging from his mouth

"" Absolutely dull and idiotic "" He scoffed, accompanied with a dramatic flick of his hand. 

' Well this Sherlock is probably even more of a prick than the real one.

Probably '

Taking in a deep breath, John told himself that once Arthur and the cat were relocated to a safer place, he would have all the time in the world to break down ,cry and relieve the stress within the walls of confinement, without any judgement or pity from any living beings 

"" It's terribly dull, John.It's simply not interesting to be alive anymore . Everyone is an idiot compared to me. They would bring you down to being ordinary- Disgust immediately got plastered on the detective's face - Why don't you follow my guide and join me already? We can be together again"" The baritone voice spoke again, still as rich and velvety as the first time John had heard it.

' Look mind, if you arsehole is going to recreate an illusion in the shape of Sherlock bloody Holmes, at least make it accurate and not based on what I damn bollocking feel about the madman ' John thought,muttering to himself that the real Sherlock "" married to my work "" Holmes would never say the last part, that sentiment to Sherlock was basically what dead body parts kept in the fridge was to ordinary people disgusting beyond comprehension, except in Sherlock's case, it was with an addition of hatred, indifferent and inferiority. 

Even if John had had the balls to confess before all this, it would most certainly have just ended up in John being mocked and ridiculed for his "" idiotic and superfluous feelings "" by the mad genius himself. Hearing that would probably devastate him. 

' Though maybe I should have told him, better getting hurt and then having my feelings rejected than whatever the damn tossing hell this is .And Sherlock would forget about it in a day or two, at most, given how he always deletes useless memories '

John honestly thought it would have been better if he had just got rejected by Sherlock. It would be better to just bear some hurtful ,sharper than a knife and sting worse than a bullet wound words , put on a smile and move on.It would have helped him get over this turmoil of his faster and get some closure. 

Killing one's feelings is always so much more manageable if the object of your affection wants nothing to do with you. What is better for your feelings,a quick death or a slow one dragged out unnecessarily long and painful that it lefts a massive hole in your chest and makes you wonder what is wrong with you. 

"" So what is her name, John? "" Mr Hudson asked, having two handfuls of fluff in her hands, tickling the kitten's soft and pump tummy. 

John stopped for a moment, he hadn't thought of keeping the cat indefinitely. Pets take a lot of responsibility and mental stability, something that he wasn't even sure if it was still in his possession or not. 

"" I... haven't gotten that far yet? "" He admitted 

"" Typical of you, John "" Fake Sherlock remarked in a huff , brows furrowed together, face grimacing ,teeth baring, still glaring daggers at the two new guests of the flat. 

Glancing quickly at the deranged hallucination that his broken mind had conjures up with all his guilt, grief and doubt 

"" I am real, John. Do stop being an idiot "" He retaliated as if knowing what John was thinking

' Then again, Sherlock always did so kudo to you brain for getting that right, you prick '

"" CLAWDIA "", a child-like voice boomed 

"" Her name will be Clawdia. "" Arthur added, eyes looking at the little ball of cuteness nomming on one of her paws. 

"" Is that okay, Mr John, Mrs Hudson? ""He asked, looking for affirmation. 

"" That's a good name, Arthur"" John responded with a smile 

"" It's lovely, dear"" Mrs Hudson followed, patting the boy's curly head of hair, amazed at how soft and fine it was. Then again blond do general have finer strands of hair. The rest of the morning and afternoon was the same old thing, going to work, dealing with incompetent patients who apparently couldn't even tell the truth about how they forgot to take their medication on time. One even had the audacity to accuse John of giving her cheap medicine and one particularly unsavory man was just boasting all about his nights of passion with all the young, hot curvaceous ladies

' Yes, Mr Harness the story of your carelessness leading to you getting AIDS is so inspiring that I am about to drop down and cry .Oh bloody blimey the inspiration!!' was what John had to resort to biting his tongue to keep from spilling out. Last week, one of his fellow co-workers had slipped up and made a comment on a patient's health,which was no doubt true in every sense of the word and was just made in attempt to show concern but the patient just threw a damn hissy fit, threatening to sue the clinic for "" defamation of her character "" . 

' Rich considering she insulted one of the sweetest janitors there is in the whole clinic the moment she walked her diabetic arse in here ' judged John as he finally was done listening to the bastard's conquests and sent him off with a dry smile and an indifferent goodbye which were hard to distinguish from his real ones, something he was immensely glad for.

Finally time for his lunch break, John let out a sigh of utmost relief, thanking all the holy beings in the damn universe. 

Reaching into his bag to pull out his wrapped sandwich and tea thermos, he was about dig in when Sarah walked into his office. 

"" Oh hey Sarah, what brings you here? "" John greeted, putting his lunch down. 

""Can't I just want to chat with a friend,John? "" She said playfully

"" Fair enough. So what's up? "" John replied, unwrapping his sandwich and opening his tea thermos 

"" Oh I'm fine. And you, John? "" 

The stiffness in her voice and the undoubtedly strained smile made John's eyebrows raise. Finally a lightbulb lit up above his head and he frowned

"" Sarah, you don't need to unwillingly talk to me just cause I look lonely ""

The fake smile immediately got washed off her face. 

"" John- her voice softened, fill with pity and..... maybe concern, John wasn't sure - I am just worried about you. Ever since that day, you have been.... down. You rarely speak to any of us unless necessary. ""

John was about to open his mouth but Sarah was fast. 

"" I know that your work performance is just as good as always but you should know that I am not just your boss, I am your friend and i'm worry about you. In fact all your co-workers are. You know you can tell us if anything bothers you"" 

' Can I really ? What if I told you that I have been having vivid almost eerie illusion of my dead flatmate that is always urging me to follow him? Would you still look at me with those sympathetic eyes? Would any of you do? '

"" Sarah, I appreciate your concern over your employee but really, I am fine. I'm a grown man, not some small fetus, I can take care of myself ""

"" If you say so, John but promise me that if anything happens, you will seek help "" Sarah's eyes pierced through his soul. Oh how he hated those looks packed with so much pity, it was like he was some broken thing that would break at the slightest touch of the wind. 

"" I promise "" He said, forcing a lump in his throat

And with that Sarah was out of the door, leaving John with an utter loss of appetite. He quietly wrapped back his uneaten sandwich and took a large gulp of his tea, trying hard to keep it together. 

The rest of his shift continued as normal, thankfully his last patients were sick children, accompanied by their concerned but not so aggressive parents. The kids were well-behaved, albeit a bit shy, which was something John understood given how much children are afraid of doctors with all their needles and bitter pills. 

After bidding the patients and their parents goodbye, John packed up his things, took of his lab coat and went home. 

 

Finally after a fuck ton of mid term exams , I am back with some more final mid term exams but no worries I will try to update as soon as possible ( thank you my school allow students to use their phones after they finish work) , . Anyway hope you enjoy the latest chapter, I am astonished as how far we have come but there is still a long way to go so buckle up my dear. Remember to comment, give kudo or bookmark my work you want to see more


Two days later 


' I wonder when the DNA results will come? ' John questioned( for the fifth time these past two days) while reading the newspaper with Arthur sitting beside reading one of his medical documents on the topic of cancer and Clawdia in the doctor's lap. It was 10 am already and normally John would be at work dealing with his first or second patient of the day ,fortunately for John , he didn't have to go to work today. 

Putting down the newspaper, he looked over to Arthur 

"" Hey Arthur, I'm going to Tesco to get some grocery. Would you like to go with me, lad? "" 

"" Can I ? "" Arthur asked, not used to being able to go anywhere far from home. Mother said that she couldn't bear being seen with him

"" Of course lad "" John chuckled, letting Clawdia jump off his lap before standing up to grab his overcoat. 

Entering the dairy aisle, John picked up three bottles of milk and rested them in the basket before getting every else that they needed. Bread, butter, vegetables, pasta, rice, some chicken breasts,.. 

Turning over and seeing Arthur eyeing the candy aisles

"" Arthur, time to go, lad ""

"" O-okay, Mr John ""

Exiting the shop, John reached in one of the plastic grocery bags

"" Here, lad "" He said, letting the chocolate bar land in Arthur's hands

A look of confusion appeared on his freckled face. 

"" Consider it a little treat for all the help with the meals these past few days"" 

Having walked for a few minutes, John noticed that a certain slick black car had been following them for a while now. Wanting to confirm his suspicious, he glanced back at the car. 

' Oh bloody course ' he thought, recognize the iconic design of the car sent by the Ice Man himself. 

As the car got closer to them on the empty street

' Prefect place to kidnap someone ' acknowledged John. He wasn't going to get involved in any of this. 

Holding Arthur's hand tighter in fear of getting the boy involved whatever that the government usually encountered, John picked up his pace and consequently Arthur's. 

"" Mr John- he wheezed at first, a bit confused but catching a glimpse of the car approaching them closer by the passing second made him realize at least part of the reason why John was suddenly anxious to get home. 

They were being followed. 

As they were about to enter a busy street in hope of losing sight of the car, a voice caught their attention. 

"" JOHN, LISTEN TO US "" It was Anthea- well at least that was what she wanted John to refer to her as, with her head poking out of the car. 

"" So the bloody British Government is so lazy that he can't even oversee a kidnapping committed in his personal interest "" retaliated John, turning around to get a good look at his supposed kidnapper. ( or kidnappers - after all Mycroft's minions never worked alone) 

The hard, stoic glare he had was mixed with a bit of confusion after witnessing the assistant's expression who actually looked...................................................................... worried and a bit shocked 

' It's a trick ' his brain shouted 

"" I'm not getting in the car "" John stood his ground, awaiting for the next persuasion from the assistant, putting himself in front of Arthur, who was clinging onto John's forearm,to create a barrier between the boy and the car. 

"" John, please just listen to us. I beg of you "" Anthea pleaded, still wearing a distraught expression. Either what she had to say was true or she was a damn excellent actress. 

' Or it could be neither and I'm just a damn fucking idiot ' John reprimanded himself

Ignoring the sharp sting that emitted from his forearm due to Arthur's clinging ( it wasn't the boy's fault anyway. Only John's) , John was about to open his mouth to tell Anthea to fuck off and leave them alone. 

"" Please, John. This concerns Sherlock "" 

That line made John freeze, every single muscle of his suddenly forgetting how to relax. 

"" H-has his name finally been cleared? "" He asked, not vocalising what he really wanted to ask

Anthea shook her head sadly "" No, we're still looking into it. But I beg you, John,just get in the car "" . A hint of desperation could be detected in her voice. 

John considered for a moment, before glancing back at the young boy currently in his care. 

"" No."" He said sternly "" I'm not getting Arthur involved in whatever you government officials do "", a vague gesture of his hand was added to emphasize his point. 

"" Please, John. It's a matter of utmost importance to Mycroft"" 

Covering his face with his free hand, he took one last look at Arthur, who simply wore a look of confusion but otherwise no visible signs of fear. 

Cursing under his breath, he finally gave in. 

"" Fine but if anything happens to Arthur here, I swear to all the holy deities in the bloody universe, I will strangle all of you tossers with my bare hands "" Threatened John as he and Arthur got escorted into the fancy black as night car. 

"" Thank you, John "" breathed Anthea before ordering the driver to keep driving. 

"" Mr John--Arthur said, finally managing to get back his voice -- Who are they? "" 

John let out a long sigh of exhaustion. Where would he even begin. 

"" People sent by a nosy, overprotective government official"" John informed before pulling Arthur into a hug to ease off some of his anxiety

"" Don't worry, lad. I won't let them hurt you "" John reassured, thankful that he still kept his gun close to him today 

' Thank god for oversized jumpers ' he thought, reaching down his waist to catch a feel of the butt of the gun. 

Arriving at Mycroft's manor , they were let off and escorted to his royal Umbrella himself. 

' Posh git ' thought John as he took in the fancy decor of the manor. He admitted that it was beautiful and elegant but personally it was a bit too flamboyant for his taste. Then again the Holmes brothers were known for being drama queens. 

He swore if there was a sniper awaiting their arrival at the end of the escort, he would find Mycroft and murder him using the man's precious umbrella. It didn't matter if John would make it out alive or not, he was still going to murder that bastard. 

"" Mr Holmes awaits you, Dr Watson"" The escort said, opening the fancy carved wooden door to reveal none other than Mycroft Holmes himself , sitting in his designated chair, with a "" Don't be afraid, be terrified "" look on his thin face. 

' Look like the tosser hasn't slept in days ' John noted, taking in the man's heavy bags and haggard face,usually the doctor in him would rise to the occasion but he couldn't exactly muster a care now. 

"" What's it now, Mycroft? Oh let me guess. You're going to kill me to erase every evidence of Sherlock's suicide. If it is then just do it you fucking bastard. Just leave the kid alone. He isn't involved in this, you heartless tosser "" John spat, signalling Arthur to get behind him. He knew he wasn't making much sense now but honestly he could care less. 

"" Rest assured, John. I won't do such a thing. It would be like going against my dear brother's wish-- John rolled his eyes -- This is a difficult time for you. I understand why you would hold such animosity for me. I truly love my brother, there is simply no doubt about it. I devoted a great majority of my time to making sure of his well-being-- His voice stiffened for a moment before continuing-- Yet I am partially to blame for his........ permanent departure from us. However, I understand that your companionship with him, though shorter than the number of years I spent knowing him, was more directly emotional than my fraternal, and somewhat paternal, affection for Sherlock. Whatever turmoil I am suffering now is only a fraction of yours"" 

John struggled to stop the burning of his eyes and the lump in his throat. 

"" Now you're just pulling my leg. Look. If you're going to start getting sentimental about his death then you should have done so during his funeral. If this is all you're going to do now then excuse us but we're leaving"" John said, holding Arthur's hand gently , ready to guide him and himself to the exit. 

"" WAIT, DR WATSON "" shouted Mycroft, "" This isn't what I had you come here for. Like my assistant has informed you, this matter concerns Sherlock ""

"" Unless it's about his name being cleared, I don't want to hear it. Damn sake, Mycroft, I have a child in my care "" 

"" Why yes I can see that, as a matter of fact he is why we're having this discussion "" Mycroft said, glancing at Arthur hiding behind John, like a scared duckling hiding behind momma duck, only that this duck wasn't scared but rather upset and angry, with a clear grimace plastered on his face. 

Clearing his throat, Mycroft continued:"" You see, John, before meeting you and consequently getting back on his track, my brother did some unsavoury deeds, many of which are kept as secrets shared only between us. Since your arrival, I am sure you have heard a good deal of said secrets. However, I am afraid that there are some deeds with serious consequences that I was unaware of and , thus, couldn't take action in time--

"" Oh just get to the point, you twat "" John snapped, patience wearing thin with every passing moment spent listening to him. 

"" I believe that in cases like this, seeing is preferably better than hearing"" The government official responded, unfazed, before reaching into his drawer to pull out a file and handing it to John, who looked at it suspiciously, as if there was going to be a bomb popping out 

Opening up the file , it was revealed to be a DNA result, in particularly, a paternity one. John traced over the information ( just all the standard conclusions of a DNA test)before his eyes landed on this one particular part. 


Child : Arthur Miller



Alleged Father : Sherlock Holmes 



Probability of Paternity= 99.999%


The floor seemed to shake and come to a stop simultaneously the moment the two blonds got hold of the information. It all made sense now, it was a truth John had been denying for the past days .Suddenly, for once, John was dead on correct and he wished he hadn't been. Looking at Arthur, all he could see was Sherlock's face. 

Honestly if the high-functioning sociopathic bastard was still alive now, John would probably kill him with his bare hands and then use his gun to shoot the bastard's face off. 

And for once in the history of being inconsiderate to other's feelings, his royal  Microsoft, oh great powerhouse of Great Britain actually and graciously gave the two of them time to process the shock. 

After a few minutes, Mycroft continued with the discussion

"" As you can see, it seems that my brother, Sherlock ,made yet another mistake during his drug-ridden foolish years ""

' Mistake'. Oh how that word made Arthur want to rip out the man's throat, if only he could get close enough and dip his pocket knife deep in his throat, ripping out the windpipe.

 ' well hello there violent thought . Glad to see you're up ' he thought. 

Clutching the DNA results in his hand, John felt like he was being torn in two different directions. Adding to the already as complicated as a twelfth grade geometric equation feelings he harboured for the detective was anger and a hint-- NO a fuck ton of disappointment towards how careless and bloody irresponsible Sherlock had been. 

HELL WHY SHOULDN'T HE? The tosser's action led to a child, a living being with emotions and feelings, being born in a loveless household. It amazed John how the boy even survived to this day to find out about his sperm donor of a father who was never in the picture and never would be because he was dead now, buried six feet underground with his name being tainted by rumours and quick arse conclusions. What kind of kid deserved this? 

He hoped --no prayed that Sherlock hadn't been aware of the existence of Arthur during his time of living. Because if the wanker had and had chosen not to do anything for his child then John really had to consider his sense of judgement and his taste in potential love interests. 

' Maybe I should scratch the ""potential"" part out ' echoed John's mind

"" John, as much as I know that this news is rather................................ jarring. I myself was also taken aback by the result. Never thought there would a day that I would become an uncle, at least from a genetic standpoint. But we must move forward to other matters, in particularly Arthur's accommodation . Now I don't think you would mind introducing me to my nephew "" Mycroft said, looking at Arthur( who was staring right back at him with those those big round eyes of his, unlike the Holmes brothers' cat-like ones) his glaze suddenly softened , as if reminiscing of a simpler time and the imagine of a once small exquisite child. 

"" I do have to say, he is much more well-behaved than my brother was when he was young "" Crouching his ridiculously tall frame down, finally able to take a good look at his newly discovered nephew. 

"" This is truly ironic "" He added in a whisper, almost wearing a sad smile, noticing Arthur's hair ( a sandy shade of blond similar to John's) and nose ( small, round ( just like John's) , giving his face a more good-natured appearance rather than the sharp and ethereal one of his father and uncle)

Would he even see them as such? 

' Eleven years ' that was how long Mycroft had remained ignorant of his existence. Frankly, even he ( as arrogant and prideful of a Holmes he was ) had to admit that all of this was unexpected and shocking to say the least. Trailing his eyes down to Arthur's clothes( old, worn and simply didn't fit him), he noticed some tell-tale signs of the boy's rather unhappy home life. 

' That simply won't do ' he made a tsking sound in his throat. 

' Never thought he would  do something so reckless like this, even taking into account his drug addiction at the time ' he thought sadly, a bit of disappointment on his face 

Unfortunately, in Arthur's eyes, the disappointment was directed at him, the mistake that should never have happened, a drug baby whose existence only came to be because of two individuals' horniness and carelessness, a creature that was well on the way of getting rejected by his sperm donor 's side of the family. 

' At least I can figure a way to survive in an orphanage or in foster care. Well it was nice knowing Mr John' he thought melancholically, accepting his fate. What else could he, a powerless child with no rights, do? 

"" I will arrange for all the essentials for him to be sent to you "" Mycroft said, breaking the silence. 

"" W-what? "" John inquired, honestly expecting less of the government official. Maybe he really did have a heart under all that ice and fancy suits. 

"" All the financial support and materials for him to grow up, of course. With you as his guardian"", elaborated the umbrella carrying man. 

"" Yeah I get that, Mycroft, but why me? "" John asked, already having deemed himself as unqualified. 

Arthur hoped John wasn't hinting at the fact that he disliked being with him. 

"" I am afraid I will be unavailable to take up that position for the upcoming period. You see, John, the government has caught wind of my breaching information about Sherlock's suicide, I will soon be up for an examination. Should I prove to be more of an inconvenience than an asset, I will be terminated "" He answered, taking in John's look and what he was thinking. 

"" It is exactly what you think, John. To make this matter worse, every individual, no matter what age, that is involved will also be dealt with, leaving no trace whatsoever. That's why I can't take Arthur under my wing "" 

John's face paled and twisted in disgust

"" You heartless bastards would murder an innocent child? ""

"" Unfortunately, that how things work in my profession "" said Mycroft sadly, his eyes slowly looking down. 

"" I acknowledge that it's a hard favour to ask of you but if you can't do it for me then at least do it for Sherlock's child "", pleaded the Ice Man

' He isn't just Sherlock's child . He's more than that' thought John

"" I will do it "" He replied determinedly, not too keen on the idea of an innocent life being taken . 

"" Thank you John. You must know that I, by and large, don't want to put my newly discovered nephew in harm way. I have already lost my brother, I can't make the same mistake again. "" 

"" I know, Mycroft "" was John's only response. 

Before he could stand up right and walk back to Arthur, he heard a small whisper from the government official 

"" You might want to do a check up on the boy, John"" 

Before he could demand a further explanation, the two of them were already in the process of being escorted back to John's- well their home. 

"" Well Mrs Hudson is going to be baffled "" said John as they returned to Baker Street, with a great piece of news to tell the landlady and the fact that Arthur was going to stay here longer than initially intended. 

' What has my life come to? ' he said, flopping himself down to the sofa. 

"" Hey lad, you're alright? You have been a little tad quiet "" John asked, concerned about the fact Arthur had been non-verbal through their entire trip home. 

It took a moment for John's question to register in Arthur's mind

"" I-i just didn't think I would ever find out sperm donor-- no father's identity, let alone his death. "" He said, with his legs pulled up to his chest and his arms wrapped around them, too uncomfortable to even say the word ""father"" without feeling repulsed yet he still pulled through with the intention of not making John upset,clutching his hair in an attempt to make sense of something, anything. It was like the fabric of reality was collapsing in front of him. He wished he hadn't seen Sherlock's picture, at first he was puzzled as to why the two of them looked similar , but now , knowing the truth,he couldn't look into the mirror without the thought of becoming like him plaguing his already messed up mind. 

What if they're just keeping you to fill his place? A Sherlock Junior? 

That thought haunted him. He could already feel another the urge to peel away his face in order not to look like him. 

' Maybe if I pull out my eyes, I won't have to deal with this ' thought Arthur darkly, deeming his issues as messed up and ridiculous. Normal kids didn't have these thoughts poking at their minds, tearing them apart and yet still leaving enough for them to acknowledge how fucked up they were. 

"" You don't have to call him that if you are uncomfortable to do it, Arthur"" assured John softy, feeling the tension in the boy's voice. 

"" B-but you love him, don't you? Disrespecting him means disrespecting you "" whispered Arthur, not even understanding his own emotions.  He hated, resented the sperm donor for years, maybe even all of his life. He hated how he existed because of him, hated the fact he was messed up because of them. He hated the fact he was nothing but an accident, a mistake made in the high heat of the moment by two individuals who weren't in their right bloody mind. 

' Why couldn't the egg donor just have a damn abortion back then? Did she really want to see me suffer? ' lamented Arthur, thinking how easy it would be to just wrap his hands around his own neck and squeeze hard. It would hurt but the pain would be worth it in his mind. After all the pain, there would only be silence, a forever state of slumber. He frankly thought it was tempting

John stopped for a moment. Was his love for Sherlock that obvious? He always thought of Sherlock as not being interested in sex or romance, but now the proof of how Sherlock had been completely able to get it on just fine was sitting right before his eyes . 

' Idiot, it was just a scratching of a biological itch to him. He didn't love anyone. Even if he had, that person wouldn't have been you ' his brain reprimanded him. 

' No  this isn't about me .This is about Arthur ' decided John , mentally punching himself for being so self centered. After all  he was nothing but a puppy following the genius ,stroking his ego with praises and making him feel so superior to others. 


That was all he had been, no more no less


"" Come here ,lad-- he said  pulling Arthur into a hug , letting the boy cry all over his shoulder, -- it's okay, everything will be fine, I promise. What's in the past is in the past, I know it's a lot to take in. But there's no need to worry , as your guardian, I will help you through it ""

' But then who will help you ,Mr John ? "" thought Arthur, whose throat was too clogged up with all the crying and hiccuping to voice out his thought. 

 

 

I am back, my darling, please let me know what you think of the latest chapter.

 

For the sake of confidentiality and protection of Arthur, for the time being ( at least until the news about Sherlock's suicide died down), the news wasn't disclosed to anyone( otherwise the poor boy would be bombarded by the press within hours) ,aside from John, Lestrade( due to him being the one to suggest the DNA exam)and Mrs Hudson. 

Speaking of telling Mrs Hudson the news. 

The next morning was when all the stuff needed to take care of a child that Mycroft had arranged for was sent to the flat. There were clothes, study equipment, toothbrush, footwear, books, even toys such as a teddy bear and among many other things that John thought was simply too much. He wasn't even sure that all these would fit in the flat without removing some of his own things.............................................. or Sherlock's. 

' The wanker really thought it through ' John facepalmed, a bit amazed at how fast the transition was. 

' It's like he expected all of this and prepared in advance, although it's more likely that he just had a bunch of people buy everything at the child section of the mall. ' 

Before John was able to think further into the working mechanic of bloody Mycroft Holmes, he was met with a confused squeal. Walking upstairs taking two steps at a time, he was soon greeted with the appearance of Mrs Hudson, who were trying to nudge through the crowd of Mycroft's minions while wearing a puzzled expression as to why there were people carrying boxes among boxes of things into John's flat. The other tenants were equally baffled, whispering to each other and asking what was with all the people wearing all black entering John's flat while carrying boxes. Honestly to the outsider's view, it looked like a bloody FBI raid or rather aid in this case ( complete with people wearing all blacks and covering their faces with masks). 

Delivering the news to Mrs Hudson was.........., in a way, like reliving the shock for John. 

At first, Mrs Hudson thought it was a prank ( oh how John wished ) but one look at John's expression and the recollection of Sherlock's history had her no longer doubtful. To make sure of getting rid of any lingering doubt the kind landlady might still cling to, he produced the daunting DNA result, now wrinkled due to him squeezing it in his trance , from his drawer and handed it to her. 

"" Oh poor thing - she exclaimed, raising her hand to cover her agape mouth, with which John could only silently agree - First abandoned by his mother and now he found out his father is dead. Oh if Sherlock were still alive and I could find that nasty woman, I would strangle them both "" She continued in a hiss, angry at the sweet boy's misfortune.

"" Oh you and me both ,Mrs H "" John replied, waiting for the crowd of people to be done with their job so he could proceed with his mundane routine. He hoped the people wouldn't bother Arthur who was in the living room playing with Clawdia last time he saw him, which was only 10 minutes before all this aid came in. 

After all the ruckus, John was glad to see the backs of Mycroft's people. Entering the flat, he first saw Arthur sitting on sofa with Clawdia sitting contentedly on the top of his curly head. John felt an amused grin creep up on his face. 

"" The people were moving around and she got scared so I let her rest on my head "" Arthur explained, feeling the feline jumping off his head to resume her daily mischief, before starting to stare off into the distance again. 

' The lad really has got a staring problem'

"" So- how are you taking this, lad? ""John asked, not exactly expecting an answer. The kid was doing significantly better than he imagined. Not everyone could stay calm after being abandoned by their mother and then discovering that their father was dead through their government official of an uncle, at least that was what they were to him biologically. But being biologically linked doesn't always ensure a close bond

"" Better than the standard kids my age, I guess "" He replied bluntly, before looking down, looking he had to ask something but was too afraid to do so.

' Fingers fidgeting in an attempt to get hold of something,eye slightly twitching, legs shifting in discomfort. ' the doctor noted. 

"" Ok, out with it,Arthur "" John said, crossing his arms, his face soft but firm. He wasn't going let the kid bottle up his emotions just like Sherlock. 

' You think he had emotions. You are pathetic ' John quickly shoved that into his chamber of unwanted emotions, adding more locks and chains to further ensure its entrapment. He didn't have the sanity to deal with this for the time being 

"" W-what? "" Arthur responded in a defensive tone, fingers curling together, eyes staring piercingly, just like Sherlock when he had been in one of his dark moods. 

John sighed at the resemblance. 

' Not now, you bloody loony ' he thought, reprimanding himself. He could almost hear the tone Sherlock used when insulting him. 


  You're an idiot, John  


' Dear god, maybe in my next session, Ella will put me in the psych ward if I disclose this to her. Next thing I know, I may be wearing a straitjacket and locked in a padded cell ' he lamented, a bit torn between telling or not telling his therapist about his vivid hallucinations. The first time he had told her, she had advised him some methods and tricks to get rid of the visions. And they had worked .............................................................. for a while before the visions had gotten more vivid and more convincing. It was unbearable, everyday waking up and being expected to act like you're still okay in the head when you are clearly not. At this point, he might as well be considered clinically insane and depressed. In spite of the desperate attempt at humour,John feared one day he might believe them, the dreaded visions of Sherlock that were always telling him how much he meant to the detective and that with just one pull of the trigger, they would be together again, as if no one had never left. 

' Oh never mind with these thoughts and visions, I have a child to take care of ' 

Once again repressing his emotions, John cleared his throat before speaking in a soft voice. 

"" Arthur, I know you want to ask me something. It's okay to do so, you have the right to know about him"" He said, expecting the boy to inquire information about his biological father. No matter how much the boy resented his parents ( which was understandable, taking into account his circumstances), he must be interested in knowing what kind of person Sherlock had been during his living time, maybe in order to validate or invalidate his resentment towards the dead. 

It was like an eternity had passed when Arthur decided to speak. 

"" I don't want to make you upset. "" He said, before lowering his head down

"" This is ridiculous, utterly ridiculous"" said the boy in whisper.

John was a bit taken aback. "" W-what? ""

"" Six days, not counting today, that was how long you have known me and I have known you, Mr John. It's hardly enough time for anyone to form attachments to anyone and yet you have done nothing but showed me kindness. I just don't understand, I can't comprehend why you would do this. You even helped me take care of a stray cat I found. - He slowly reached for his face, the one that he was slowly growing to hate, despite knowing how illogical it was to do so ( Am I that insane and illogical ?) - Is it because I look like him that you treat me so well. You think I am going to become like h-him, don't you? That I will become a Sherlock Junior."" His hands were starting to shake and move like he was trying choke something. Why was it that he cared so much about making John upset? 

' Nice job, stupid. Now he will truly think you're fucked up, you soon-to-be-serial-killer' 

"" I don't want to become like him. I don't want to become like either of them "" Pictures of white powder, colourful pills contained within bottles and the rattling of the containers of alcoholic drink were bombarding his senses. Why couldn't he be a normal kid with a happy home life? Why was he so sacred of becoming like his parents? What if his father wasn't so bad and he was disrespecting him in front of the person who loved him? 

He was going to get into trouble

' Maybe I am just being a lunatic, there are other kids who have had it worse than me. So why am I like this? Why am I such a freak, a weirdo, a mistake?'

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"" Just forget it, please Mr John"" Arthur suddenly said, standing up to walk to his room- well it was John's but it was being used as Arthur's for the time being. It was an attempt to shut off the conversation to avoid spilling out bottled feelings. 

Reaching out to hold Arthur's arm, to hold him  back from furthering his plan of bottling his feelings ( he couldn't let him do that, not after Sherlock ), he was surprised to receive a sharp hiss of pain coming from Arthur, who was trying hard not to let John know but did a rather poor job hiding the pained expression painted on his face 


You might want to do a check up on the boy, John


' It can't be ' he thought  despite knowing how absurdly likely it was for this to be true. 

He quickly brought Arthur closer, pulling up the sleeves of his oversized shirt ,in spite of the boy's protest. His stomach dropped like a large boulder sitting on top of an unstable platform when the sight of the bruises and cuts littered on both of Arthur's arm caught his attention ( greenish brown, happened about a week prior ,showing signs of healing but seem to still cause him pain ). Some of the bruises were in shape of a hand, a woman's to be precise. John hurried checked the boy's torso, only to discover that it was in similar state. There were signs of healing but risk of infections was not negligible. 

"" Sit down now Arthur "" John said, pulling the boy toward the sofa, before going to fetch the med kit. Arthur only silently obliged. 

"" You should have told me earlier, lad. "" He continued upon returning. "" It may be a little painful. Bear with it a bit, okay? "", bringing up a ball of cotton soaked in disinfectant to more recent wounds. Arthur hissed at the contact but remained well-behaved nonetheless. 

"" Don't worry, it will soon pass "" reassured John, doctor mode activating. After cleaning all the wounds properly and applying medicine to them, he moved on to his torso. 

' No broken ribs ' relieved John

 

 

Arthur's torso had suffered some wounds, similar to his arms, but thankful none of his ribs were broken, although there were some cuts and scratches that needed to be cleaned and bandaged to prevent future infections. Tracing his fingers across the boy's torso, John was a bit horrified to how malnourished he was ( not to the point of ribs poking out but he was close). John was glad that his mother had abandoned him sooner than later. He wondered how much longer Arthur would have survived if he had still been in his mother's care. The image of an emaciated Arthur on the verge of being beaten to death flashed before his eyes but he quickly shook it off, resuming his task of tending the very much alive and on the way of getting better boy before him. 
"" There ya go - John said, finally finishing patching Arthur up - the injuries should heal in about a week or so"", he added before putting away the med kit.
"" Usually it takes me only 5 days more to heal from this "" Arthur said, admiring the skillful wrapping of the bandages around his torso. ' As expected of a military doctor ' he thought, wondering if he could master this given enough time. Maybe John could teach him?
""U- usually? "" John breathed, sad to know that this had been such a daily occurrence to Arthur that he would simply disclose it without a bat of an eye.
' But then why was he so insistent on not letting me check on him? Oh , of course subconscious reflexes ' John thought
"" I can stop spilling these details out if you feel uncomfortable, Mr John"", offered Arthur, noticing the sudden silence from John. It would be awkward to keep creating this tension between the two of them. Might lead to difficulties in their cohabitation.
John quickly declined the offer.
"" No, you don't have to, Arthur. It's okay. I was just-
"" Feeling sad about my condition? "" He inquired
"" Well yes - John trailed off, having trouble trying to find the right way to say - but I also admire how strong you are""
A look of confusion flashed onto Arthur's face.
"" How can a child like me be strong? --He said, tilting his head to the side and gesturing at John's shoulders-- I don't even want any defined muscles like you. I can barely lift anything more than 20 pounds "" 

John let out a light chuckle, sitting down on the sofa beside Arthur. 

"" Lad, strength isn't just about the physical kind, strength can be about how mentally resilient you are. The ability to go through something terrifying and still come out strong is admirable and not a trait that everyone has. ""

"" But I didn't come out strong. I came out unstable and illogical "" Arthur said, staring at his hands, remembering all his thoughts about how it would feel to strangle the people he hated( oh how he carved to see their faces twisted in anguish), namely his mother. 

"" Trauma can be a bitch,you aren't at fault for what happened to you. Anyone would be a bit messed up after what you have been through, of course it doesn't excuse any potential detestable actions in the future but you shouldn't be too harsh on yourself,lad. What's in the past is in the past. It's maybe hard to move on but don't worry, you'll have me alongside you--"" John said, pulling Arthur face to face with him--"" And you're not like him, Arthur. Just because you're his son biologically doesn't mean you're bound to grow up like him. --""

"" B-but--

"" No but, Arthur. You're not bad, lad. Hell, I think you're more compassionate than most kids I know. You risked getting hurt just to save a stray cat. You care about my feelings.These things aren't actions that Sherlock would have done when he was alive. Believe me when I say you are not like him. And don't worry if you feel more comfortable calling him ""sperm donor "". After all he isn't here anymore to hear it "" He added, guessing that Arthur probably felt more better if he could feel a sense of dissociation when it came to his relation to Sherlock. He didn't blame him. Even he himself didn't think Sherlock would have been a good parent, especially in his druggie years. The man after all had seen all sentiments and emotions to be beneath him, scoffing at the sheer sight of anyone catching any hope of forming a bond with him. John's heart cracked a little more at that fact (? ) but he would rather face the truth as soon as possible and get this over. Right now someone needed him. 

"" B-but you love him, don't you? Why would you bear my disrespecting him? ""

"" It's complicated. Arthur. I will tell you another day when I am ready "" John let out a sad smile. 

Despite feeling a bit impatient  , Arthur knew not to press forward on the matter. He knew what it feels like for someone to keep pressuring you to tell things you're not comfortable telling. It's a weight is on your chest and your ears are ringing with sound of "" Tell me! Tell me! You're being difficult. Why are you so dramatic? "".The ringing won't stop no matter how hard you try,it won't cease until you break down crying and they accuse you of being emotional and then laugh at you or accuse you of being the one who is mean when you decide enough is enough and lash out. 

' Thankfully that took place outside of school. I can't risk my record being tainted ' Arthur thought, vividly remembering how much he yearned to tackled those kids to the ground and sink his knife into them.

' But then did them really deserve that? ' he thought again, knowing fully well those kids hadn't known any better. Not like everyone had endured traumas and forced to mature quickly like him. Nonetheless the thoughts still persisted, filling his head with increasingly dark ideas, whenever they were about ending his or others' life. 

Returning to reality, Arthur asked "" But you will tell me one day right, Mr John? "" , to be on the safe side. He needed all the information to validate his feelings and to distinguish which were his trauma-induced ones and which were not. 

"" Of course, lad. You have the right to know who he was. But maybe not now, it can be a lot to take in. How about we talk about something else for now? ""

John really didn't know if he was saying that for Arthur's sake or his. Maybe both? 

"" Can you teach me how to bandage wounds? It would be a useful skill later on in my life "" Arthur requested. He had always been interested in the medical field. There are simply so much usefulness in knowing these knowledge. He couldn't comprehend why more people didn't care to learn more about medicine. The information could save their lives one day. 

"" Of course, lad "" John smiled, grabbing a roll of elastic bandage. 

"" Now put your hand forward. The first lesson will be about the basic first : how to bandage an injured hand. I will make an example and then you try to replicate it , okay? ""

"" Okay, Mr John ""

The first time wasn't prefect, like at all. And Arthur was a bit disappointed ( am I that incompetent? ) .

""It's okay, Arthur. First time is never the charm. It's okay to make mistakes. Let's try again "" John reassures him, unrolling the clumsy bandage from his own hand. In spite of that, the boy's expression was still a bit sour 

"" I will let you in on a secret lad. When I first tried to learn how to bandage, I accidentally bandaged my hand so tight that I couldn't get it to unwrap for nearly half an hour. ""

"" Really? ""

"" Yep, I nearly tripped myself trying to unwrap it in a hurry""

A muffled huff could be heard from Arthur. John reconsidered this a mission accomplished. 

"" Okay, now, let's get going with our lesson. Time doesn't wait for anyone"" He said, ruffling Arthur's blonde hair. "" Remember to pull just tight enough and make sure the bandage is secured -....... 

The next morning, Lestrade decided that it was time to pay a visit. 

"" Oh hello Lestrade "" John greeted

"" Just call me Greg, John. I am not on duty right now "", Greg said, entering the flat and turning his head around

"" He's fine, mate "" John replied, noticing his friend's actions. 

"" O-oh yeah, thanks, I was just-  ""

"" Worried? Shocked? Yeah I know, not everyday you discover that a sociopathic consulting detective has a lovechild. "" John said, putting the kettle on the stove. He needed his morning cup of tea. "" Honestly Greg,I wouldn't have thought that just because of his appearance that you would urged a bloody DNA test. "" 

Greg made an offended face

"" John, the kid literally walked into a crime scene guarded by official police officers and managed to sneak in without anyone noticing. Not only did he not get traumatized but he even stared at the corpses in fascination. And he even made a damn deduction. How was I supposed to NOT make a connection? --

"" True "", John said amusingly, pouring hot water into his mug of tea "" Would you like a cuppa too, Greg? ""

"" Yes, thank you -- But seriously when Arthur showed up out of nowhere, I nearly got a heart attack. I think that it was one of my crazy ideas. But when the result came --

"" Yeah I know, Greg, not everyday we discover that the late only consulting detective in the world has a lovechild ""

"" I know that he was low during those years but I never thought that he would do something this reckless. Oh bloody hell eleven years, John. Do you know how that can affect a child? ""

John nodded, having read a good deal of psychology books during his medical student years. He still did now. 

"" But he's strong, Greg. With enough help, I am sure he can overcome this""

' Unlike me '

"" If you think so, John. You're the one with good judgement "" Greg sighed. 

' I don't think so considering how I trusted Sherlock ' John thought sadly, remembering all the time he should have just given up on ever confessing his feelings, killed them off and thrown them off a river to rot into nothing. It would hurt but at least it wouldn't be as slow and agonizing as this. 

Catching a glimpse of his deranged replication of Sherlock, in his trench coat and suit,John turned his head away and shut his eyes but not before he saw the vision mouth"" I love you, John "" 

When he opened them, the vision was gone. 

' At least this time, the vision isn't such a dick.'

"" You okay, John? "" Greg asked 

""Yeah, just haven't woken from sleep yet. I have been sleeping on the sofa for the time being. Maybe I will move into Sherlock's room after this. My back have been killing me.""

Greg 's face turned into a sympathetic one. 

"" John, this must be hard for you, with no doubt. I, just, hope you will get better soon. In the meantime, I don't think it's time to rush anything "" 

"" Really? A currently sleep-deprived detective with blood shot eyes and a hair messy enough to rival a crow's nest is giving me advice on being healthy? "" John teased

"" Oi you arse, I just have too much cases on my plate these days. After this, I will probably sleep for a whole weekend "" 

"" Sleeping too much can cause harm, Greg ""

"" Whatever, doctor ""

"" Mr Lestrade "" 

It was not an exaggeration to say that Greg nearly jumped off the floor two feet from where he stood. 

"" Jesse Chris, Arthur. You scared me there ""the inspector said, wondering how the hell could a child move so quietly without making a sound. But then he did have Sherlock's genes 

""Sorry,i didn't mean to ""

' Well he is more polite than Sherlock '

"" It's okay,kid.Anyway what do you want to ask?"" ""How was the result of the case, Mr Lestrade? ""

"" Well you were right, Arthur, although we did find out that the attacker had actually planned this out beforehand. Too bad it didn't work according to plan for the bloke ""

"" But i was still right 90% , right? ""

"" Give or take, kid ""

"" YES "" Arthur said excitedly, doing a little happy dance of his own, which just involved tapping his feet on the floor to a make-up rhythm

She plants it on your lips and steps back as you both break out into giggles.

            'I want to kiss John too!' you hear a voice cry, and you turn and see that it's Simon, his lip trembling and his eyes watering. Bethany rolls her eyes at the sight and you laugh louder before grabbing his hand, small but still bigger than yours, and pull him close.

'Here, Simon,' you say as you place a kiss on his trembling lips, watching as Simon's eyes and smile grow wide and Bethany's giggles grow shrill, her plaits swinging as she doubles over.

The bubble of childhood innocence bursts as you feel a hand - much, much bigger than your own this time - grasping your arm, pulling you from your reverie. Bethany quiets instantly, and the tears reappear in Simon's eyes.

You spend the next hour in the headmaster's office, his droning voice teaching you what's appropriate for a young man to do. You're not a young man, you think, you're five, but you say nothing until your dad arrives to pick you up. His blue eyes are cold, and you make sure you stay quiet.

Tears well over as your dad shouts himself hoarse on the car ride home and he gets even louder when he spots them trailing down your cheeks. You're disgusting, he says, a shameful poof, and where did he go wrong in life to have a pansy son? You don't know what these words mean yet, not really, but you will soon and you can feel an anger settling in under your skin, a vibrating mess that you itch to let out.

The next day at school you push Simon to the floor when he asks you to play, and you look the other way when you see his expression of betrayal, heartbroken.

You wish it were yesterday, when you were both laughing so hard your ribs ached.

 

You're eighteen years old and holding your acceptance letter into King's College whilst trying to ignore the way Harry's shouting is getting louder and higher, the way it does when she's truly distressed. The paper is thick between your fingers, probably the best quality paper you've ever touched, and you brush your fingers over where your name is printed. Mr John Watson.

            You're going to turn that Mr into Dr even if it kills you.

            Harry's boots stomp down the stairs for the last time in this house and you wince as the front door slams against its hinges, your dad swinging it back open and shouting at Harry in the street. You put the letter on the bed and move to the window, shifting the drab net curtains to the side. Harry spots you and aims a quick, watery smile up at the window before slinging her stuffed rucksack over her shoulder and running to the car where her friend Emma is waiting. (You know they're more than friends, but you can't find the words to use for the way Harry's cocky grin turns shy when she talks about her, and your heart jumps into your throat when you go to ask. It's only later that it becomes easier to call them girlfriends, and it only happens when you've moved into dorms.)

            'Bye, Harry,' you say to the banged-up Ford as Harry pulls the door shut.

            Your dad stays in the street, still shouting, until the car squeals out of the street, and you find yourself mirroring his squared shoulders and clenched fists and feel bile rise to the back of your throat. It's good Harry got out and it's about time somebody did, but you can't help but feel a little betrayed that she left you here with him. You turn and your gaze falls to the letter on the bed, the back type and cream paper stark against the greying sheets.

You won't be here for much longer, and you won't be coming back.

 

At twenty-five, the roiling pot of anger inside you has quieted to a simmer, too exhausted from ward placements and essays to feel anything other than a fatigue that's only kept from consuming you by a steady buzz of caffeine, thanks to the tea you drink.

            Your uni mates have already begun their plans to move cross-country, to their hometowns where they'll be pediatricians 'til they retire. You'll miss them, of course you will, but it's easier to breathe now you're getting closer to a time where you don't have to meticulously plan bathroom trips. You've done your best to avoid bumping into half-naked housemates in the hallway, their hair still dripping and towels slung low over angular hips, but it's getting harder to ignore the way your mouth goes dry when you laugh it off with them.

            You're not gay. A steady stream of girlfriends over the years has confirmed to you that, yes - you still like women. A lot. Your mind drifts back to memories of Siobhan's soft curves and small-but-wicked hands sometimes when you're in the hospital break room and your brain actually has a chance to slow down and think, and Kathy had been a good girlfriend for the three months that you went out. (It was the longest relationship you've had, but your head wasn't in it. It's been too busy with work and ignoring slurred voicemails from Harry.) So you don't understand why that can't be enough for you.

            You don't understand why you can't just be normal.

            Running through the corridors of the hospital keeps the questioning at bay, keeps it under the skin where it's happy to lie quiet, but you dread the day that your studies are over and you have to face the real world. There's no way you're following in your mates' footsteps, you'd rather gnaw off your leg than go home, but with no girlfriend and no specialty lined up - though you're good at emergency surgery, very good, with the steadiest hand that the rest of your placement envies - you're not sure what you want to do with the rest of your life. You've made something of yourself, and that's all you've ever wanted to prove, but there's no plan there.

            Which is why when the Army asks, you say yes, and you fall into the rush of St Bart's and eventually, Afghanistan.

            That's where it falls apart.

 

You're thirty-fucking-five and you can't keep still. The Foxhound's engine rumbles as you cross the desert, swaying in your seat as you ride over divots and craters in the dry earth. Some are probably natural formations. Others, you know, are all that remain of days and nights of endless bombings.

The squad sat with you in the back are your family now - good men and women that you stitch up and send off running again with a clap on the shoulder. You squint through the sunlight to look at Peter sat opposite to you, his legs wide and exuding confidence and familiarity. He looks at you and raises an eyebrow, smirking, and you lick your lips before looking to the horizon. It's not a good idea. But it's an idea, and you know that it's not just your own. You can feel the weight of his gaze lingering on your mouth before he turns to joke with Jackie. It's her you should fancy, she's all steel eyes and take-no-shit attitude, but there's something about Peter's chestnut skin deepening even more under the excruciatingly dry sun, stretching over his strong arms and lightening the hair there that you want.

'Heads up, check-point ahead,' Rocky says from the driver's seat through the hatch. You turn round to the window and see the weathered building no bigger than a shed and your hands clench in your lap, expectant. It's a familiar feeling nowadays, channeling the adrenaline your temper gifts you. It's - good. You think. It is what it is, anyway.

'Anybody want anything from the drive-thru?' Peter jokes with a grin, and Jackie punches his bicep whilst rolling her eyes, but her lips are twisting up reluctantly and so are yours.

You know something's wrong when there's a moment that's just too quiet, too still, and then your suspicions are confirmed when the car overturns.

Blood blurs your vision and there's a ringing in your ears that won't stop when you shout, 'Everyone okay?!'

You think you shout it, anyway, but you can't hear yourself nor anything else for that matter. You unbuckle your seatbelt with trembling hands and grunt when you slump upside down against the roof of the patrol car. Wiping the blood away from your eyes and quickly feeling for injury - it's superficial, a graze or split skin that's bleeding loads because that's what heads do - and you scan over the squad. Jackie's out cold but you can feel her pulse thrumming under the thin skin of her wrist when you reach over, Peter and Rocky are - God. Oh, God. The metal of the car is crumpled around them, half of Peter's head caved in like a deflated football.

You swallow the sick that fills your mouth back down, choking on it for a moment, and move to carefully unclip Jackie's seatbelt before the Foxhound's engine decides to explode. Her lean body slumps against you as you try to kick the back door open but your leg is weak, too weak, but the other one kicks fine when you try it and the doors fly open, the left half falling off its hinges as you move to drag Jackie out.

Your skin is thrumming and your ears are ringing and you barely even feel the bullet when it rips through your shoulder, sending you flying into the sand besides Jackie's unconscious body as you beg, 'Please, God, let me live.'

 

You're thirty-six, chasing a mad genius across London on the daily and you know that you're screwed.

            Life with Sherlock is... consuming. He's mental, and amazing, rude but sometimes sweet and an absolute cock at times. You can't get enough of him and it terrifies you. You were lost from the moment you laid eyes on him, his dark curls farming frankly ridiculous cheekbones and a voice like heavy velvet. It was exhilarating; he was exhilarating, with just a hint of danger that you could feel pulling you in, magnetic.

            The high you get from solving a case with him electrifies you, hums in your fingertips that ache to pull him down into you as he stands beside you (too close, he's always too close god you wish he'd never move) and your chests heave as your eyes meet, and you know you aren't imagining that there's something there begging to happen.

            It's familiar though, too, and your mind flicks images of Simon and Peter behind your eyelids, and you move away eventually because Sherlock never moves first. You wish he would, just once, but then again you aren't sure whether you'd want him to lean in or look away.

            You're not gay, though, and you prove it by dating a string of women that you can't remember the details of and fucking away the image of Sherlock's wiry frame spread out across sheets. No girlfriend deserves to be strung along by a man who doesn't know what he wants, though, so you give it up eventually and try not to wallow in the guilt.

At this point it's just instinct to deny it.

'I'm not actually gay,' you say to the woman, Irene, before she blows your mind.

'Well I am,' she says, smirking at your confusion, 'look at us both.'

And that's when it hits you that other people feel the same way you do, that you're allowed to want men whilst liking women, too. (You'd heard of bisexuality before, obviously, but that had been - background information. You'd never actually seen it in practice, never met somebody who feels the same way you do.) Of course it's The Woman that tells you this, and of course it's her that Sherlock actually wants.

Your fists clenches at your side, pushing down the tremor, and Irene looks at you in that 'I-see-everything' way that her and Sherlock do and she smiles in delight at getting a reaction out of you. You curse when you hear Sherlock's customised text-tone and Irene just smiles wider.

She dies and you can't fully quash the evil, jealous relief that swells inside.

Sherlock dies and you feel nothing again.

 

You're thirty-eight when Mary picks you up, dusts you off and makes you feel something closer to alive again. She's quick as a whip, though, and you predict the question before it comes.

            'So,' she starts, swirling wine in her glass as she leans over the table towards you, and the buzzing under your skin starts up, 'you and Sherlock. Were you...?'

            Mary lets the question hang, and you could deny it easily. She's giving you an easy out, but you owe it to her not to take it.

            'No, we weren't,' you say, taking a sip from your water glass that's shaking slightly in your hand.

            'But you wanted to,' she says, and it's then that you get the idea to marry her. Mary is beautiful, truly, her wide eyes glittering in the candlelight and her mouth stretched into a small but kind smile, and you take a moment to appreciate her before you speak.

            'Yes,' you admit, and it comes out breathy, punched out of you by the force of admitting something that you had pushed down for so long. You expect her to down the wine and leave the table to never return, but she doesn't. She puts down her glass and puts her hand over yours, resting them both on the table together.

            You pay the bill when it arrives and the next day you buy the ring.

            Then Sherlock keeps a promise you asked for at his grave and turns your world upside-down, in the way that only he can manage.

            You fight with yourself through the next year: through the traumatic reappearance of Sherlock, acting for all the world like he hadn't ripped your soul in two when he left. Through your wedding, sat between the two people that love you most and whom you aren't sure you love more. Through the discovery that Mary wasn't as perfect as you had imagined - she was more. Just like Sherlock was more.

Mary, though, gives you Rosie, who actually is perfect, and through the terror you swear to her that you'd be the father you wish you'd had.

You grit your teeth through it all and act like you aren't being pulled apart.

 

Pushing forty already feels like hell, your knees clicking when you move too quickly and your head throbbing the day after you have a single beer, but it feels even worse when Mary dies and the vibrating, simmering anger is let loose.

            You don't mean to aim it at Sherlock but it's so easy because none of this would have happened if he'd just done something, if he'd just taken you when you were available and wanting him so badly you ached with it.

            You still want him. You just want to hurt him too, and although it's not fair you can't control it.

            Punches are thrown and venomous words are spat out at the broken man you've loved since you met him, and you're so like your dad in that moment that it's only the thought of him being proud of you that slows your next punch. Rosie deserves somebody who is nothing like your dad was.

            So you get on with doing what's expected of you, like you always have. You save Sherlock's life because he's busy saving yours and you help him pull himself back together like the sight of him doesn't wake you want to scream what-ifs, like what if you'd kissed him that first night, or any of the other ones that you wanted to? What if you carried on limping away when Mike Stamford called your name?

            Instead, you confess your sins to Sherlock and let him hold you when the tears spring to your eyes. You duck your head down and away because dad had hated when you cried so much, but he just pulls you closer and you hate that you wish you were closer still.

            'It is what it is,' Sherlock says, softly. He's shaking from the withdrawal and you want to soothe, help or scream but he just strokes a hand over your hair and guides you through the breakdown that's been waiting almost forty years to happen.

            With each shuddering breath, you let yourself be the hurt one. You mourn Mary and the life she'd given you. You mourn the boy you never really got to be. You mourn for close to fifteen minutes, swaying with Sherlock on the worn carpet of 221B.

            'I have to get back to Rosie,' you say, your voice cracking somewhere in the middle.

            'Of course,' Sherlock says, but he doesn't let go instantly, his arms cradled around you for a lingering moment, 'Give her my love.'

            Your smile feels close to genuine when you look up into his open expression. 'I will.'

           

You're forty now. Forty today, in fact, and it feels - good.

            You smother Rosie with kisses throughout the day, basking in her gorgeous giggles and sass that no baby should ever have mastered (thanks, Mary's genes), before making the trip downstairs and dropping her into Mrs Hudson's arms for the evening.

            'You have a good birthday bash, John,' she says, winking and smiling more than she ever used to when you were dropping Rosie at her or Molly's door every day just to cope.

            'I plan to, Mrs Hudson,' you say, grinning at her laughter and placing one last kiss on Rosie's brow.

            You take the stairs back upstairs two at a time, eager to get into the living room where your friends are waiting. Lestrade is on the couch, telling a story of a difficult drugs bust and gesturing wildly at Sherlock, who is smirking at him and probably deduced where the drugs were hidden thirty seconds into the tirade. Lestrade gets up when he spots you at the door, cutting himself off and giving you a very-special-birthday-handshake.

            'Forty, mate,' Lestrade jokingly winces, and he pulls his hand back when you start to twist it round, laughing.

            'I've felt forty for a decade, it can't get much worse,' you say, before Molly walks into the room behind you and hands you a very lovely card.

            Sherlock passes you a beer, his fingers brushing yours as it's handed over, but you don't wince away from it this time. You thank him and look him in the eyes as he watches you take a long swig, before turning to greet Molly.

            There's cake at some point, supplied by Tesco's finest, and you blow the forty candles (Sherlock insisted on counting and placing them himself) out as quickly as you can lest the fire alarm goes off. You have three cold beers and by the time Lestrade and Molly leave you're sinking into your armchair comfortably.

            Sherlock is stood at the window, violin in hand but not playing, and you study the lines of his tall body, dressed in a fine maroon shirt and those damned black trousers.

            'You've decided, then,' he says suddenly, turning around to look at you, and you blink up at him.

            'Sorry?' You ask, but the tips of your fingers are beginning to tingle with what could be excitement.

            Sherlock moves over slowly, and you realise that he's completely sober. Thinking back on the night, you're not sure you ever saw him with a drink in his hand.

            'What you are,' Sherlock explains - and although you probably shouldn't, you know exactly what he's referring to. You swallow dryly before standing up from your armchair, facing him.

            'I'm bi,' you say, and you're proud of the way your voice only slightly wavers when you can practically hear your heart thundering in your ears.

            'Good,' Sherlock says, and you have a moment of confusion before you notice how close you're standing together, breathing the same air between you.

            He's waiting, you think, and you push up on the balls of your feet to press a kiss to his mouth. Sherlock presses back, and the hum beneath your skin falls silent.","['KayB90', 'Calais_Reno', 'sandra42', 'johnnyboyy', 'Mmarika', 'Moon_Ainsworth', 'orianamaia', 'RoseMartial', 'wwubd', 'Daybora', 'veowens', 'LHR_etc', 'Dee_Laundry', 'MargueriteSomebodyoranother', 'actualtrashrat', 'RuthRaven13', 'MehOolongTea']","['Nickkirk', 'orianamaia']"

I need you to tell me what do you think.' Sherlock's voice was coming from the bathroom, so John sighted and stand up.'Oh' he whispered in horror. Sherlock was standing there with his face covered in blood. The left eye was red with brow bleeding. The worst was the cut on his cheekbone - quite deep and about five centimeters long from his eye to the ear. 'What the hell happened?' John stepped into the bathroom stopped in shock.'I wanted to consult this cut with you. I suspect it needs stitches, but I believe I shouldn't do it myself.''Yeah, but Sherlock... what have you done? It's 9 AM, Saturday morning?!' John said while pulling out his emergency kit.'I told you I am going out.' He murmured and sat on the stool to make it easier for John to examine his injuries.'I thought you were going out to the store! Oh my god... Sherlock, you are so lucky. You might have lost your eye!''I didn't. I had everything under control.''Oh, Sherlock. I am so much worried about you.' John sighed but started to disinfecting the area. After few minutes everything was alright. Well, as much as it can be when your best and only friend shows up bleeding on, what was supposed to be, a peaceful Sunday morning. 'Is that the only one?''Yeah, no more cuts.' Sherlock said and stand up, holding his stomach.'Why are you holding your hand like that?''It's nothing serious, John.''Oh come on, Sherlock! You need to tell me if you were hurt. Come on, take off your shirt.' He said frustrated. 'Now!' He added after seeing hesitation from his friend.Suddenly the doorbell rang. Sherlock wanted to answer the door to leave the uncomfortable situation, but John stopped him. 'Not now, we are busy. However, it is will wait.'Sherlock sighed and unbuttoned his shirt. His stomach was bruised, but there were no cuts. John touched the stomach in multiple places. Everything seemed fine, but...'What are those?' Said John pointing kinesiology tapes covering his pectoral muscles.Before Sherlock could answer they heard someone unlocking the door.'I saw the footage and wanted to check on you... brother mine' Mycroft finished his sentence slowly trying to judge what is happening. You see... John sleeps only with boxers on...'I'm fine. We can talk in the living room.' Sherlock uttered and stormed out of the bathroom living John with his question unanswered.John sighed and started cleaning the bathroom. It took some time until he dressed up and was ready to join Holmes brothers.'Are you sure?' Mycroft sounded more worried than usual 'I don't want to mess with your choices, but... I want you to be safe.''Oh, fuck of. I've lived with him for three years. I know him.''Alright. I am going home, but John seems to be waiting behind the door. Come in!' John blushed and come in. Sherlock was sitting on the sofa with his shirt already buttoned up. 'Remember I am always there for you. Call me anytime brother mine.''I am sorry, I wasn't...' John started, but Mycroft already left.'It's okay John, sit down.' Sherlock said and smiled sadly. 'Mycroft insists on telling you something. Well, maybe also it was the situation we were a few minutes ago.''Is something wrong?' At this point, John was seriously worried.'No, nothing's wrong. I just have a... statement to make, a coming out one may say... I am transgender. John, do you know what this means?' Sherlock looked at John who opened his eyes wider.'What?''Transgender means that my masculinity is an effect of my own efforts, not the by-product of socialization. In other words - I am the one who created myself. From the basics as my name to the rest. Of course, it's all based on observation of others, but I like to say I made myself on my own.' Sherlock smiled mischievously.'Yeah, sorry. I know what transgender meant... but umm okay. I am a bit surprised.' John was struggling to speak. 'Of course, I don't have a problem with transsexuals...''Transgender, transgender people' Sherlock corrected him automatically. 'Please continue.''Thanks, I don't have a problem with transgender people, I just wasn't suspecting that. Umm so... what does it mean in terms of our relationship? How should I refer to you?' Sherlock saw John's struggle to be polite and laughed.'Sherlock. You should refer to me as Sherlock - that's my name. I also use he/him pronouns just I have before this conversation.''Yeah, right.' John nodded and suddenly his eyes opened wider, he looked at Sherlock's shirt and blushed.'Yes, the tape is covering my breasts, John.' Sherlock answered the unasked question 'If you have anything else to ask now is a good time.''Umm... Why... Umm... What was Mycroft doing here?' He blurted after a while'Oh, he saw me beaten up on his monitoring system and wanted to check if you took care of me. He is overprotective, but has good intentions.' Sherlock paused for a moment. 'Well, I need to check again where he has cameras. Anyway, do you have any other questions? Perhaps about me being transgender?''No, I don't... well can I really ask something?' Sherlock nodded 'Why do you have breasts?'Sherlock chuckled. 'My dear Watson... When you turn fourteen, sometimes even at ten or twelve your body starts to change... It can be confusing, but you as a doctor should know that.''Yeah sorry, this question was inappropriate.' Sherlock nodded and stand up to look out the window.'I'll go to my room. Call me if you need me.' John left the room and Sherlock picked up his violin.He played slow, but rather joyful music, so John concluded that he wasn't mad about the question. 'That's good' John thought. Maybe he should have known it wasn't his place to assume that Sherlock wants to have his breasts removed. He sighed. It was a bit too much for him. Of course, he was a doctor, but he went to military school, so no one there mentioned transgender people. He opened his computer and tried to google some information.***'Is he fine?' The voice from the bedroom asked'Yeah, and he came out to John.' Mycroft entered the room to see his partner sitting in bed.'Wow, that's big. And how has John reacted?' 'I wasn't there, but he texted me it was fine.''I'm sure he would call you if he had any problem.' He put his laptop away to make room 'I hope so, darling. I hope so.' Mycroft said sadly and lied on the bed putting his head on his partner's lap. Greg smiled and kissed Mycroft's forehead.'I'm sure he would.'

Enjoy John's identity crisises :)

'John? Are you there?' Only after the question, John realized that Sherlock has been knocking on the door for a few minutes.
'Huh? Yeah,' He yawned and stands up to open the door. 'Good morning' He said and walked back to bed.
'Do you want scrambled eggs?' Sherlock asked looking through his phone
'You wake me up to ask me that?'
'Yes. If I have waited until you get up, the eggs would have been cold.' Sherlock said as if this was a legitimate reason to wake someone.
'But... yeah, I want eggs.'
'Great, they are in the kitchen. I'm going to Molly, don't wait with the dinner.'
'What? You are not...' John didn't even have time to finish his question because Sherlock has already left. 'Okay. It looks like I'll eat alone.' He said to himself and help himself with the meal.
It must have been some sort of experiment because Sherlock prepared two dozens of eggs. To John's disappointment, there was no evidence of Sherlock actually eating any of it. Obviously, he was used to the eating habits of his friend, but he still was worried when he was noticing a lack of appetite for a longer period of time. John didn't know how to help his friend. The only thing he was sure of was the fact that any kind of therapist is of the limits with Holmes.
Some people (like Lestrade) have been telling John, that he shouldn't worry about it. It's not his job, and Sherlock is an adult. He knew that, but it didn't change anything.
John felt responsible for his flatmate, they lived together for a couple of years, they spend most of their free time together. Even when John was alone, he mostly thought about Sherlock. God, he even had a blog about his friend. Yeah, after some reflection it did seemed a bit odd. However, who isn't odd? John was used to the tightness of their relationship. Sherlock meant everything to him. But... he had to admit - there were some things he missed. For example the lack of physical intimacy. It's not like Sherlock told him not to date anyone. They haven't even talked about it. Well... maybe they did in the beginning, but that was a mistake. John even went on a couple of dates, but every time he felt like he would rather spend time with Sherlock. At one point he even started to question his sexuality. Maybe he is just gay? It sounded logical - a straight man should think about his male - friend during kissing a girl. He tried dating guys, but it didn't help either. He definitely was attracted to them, but still... they weren't Sherlock. So he stopped dating at all. But that... felt lonely. He spent a lot of time with Sherlock, he met his brother. They lived together... Everyone used to suspect they are dating... they didn't.
To be fair, it was something that John was thinking about often... Maybe he should date Sherlock? Maybe his other relationships were doomed to failure because he has been in love with Sherlock from the very beginning.
Somehow, he didn't feel it's a good idea. What if Sherlock doesn't want to be in that kind of relationship with him? John knew Sherlock is gay - they've talked about it once, when they were discussing a movie, they've watched together. Sherlock said the character's portrayal was stereotypical and unfair. John was surprised Sherlock cared about that, so the younger Holmes told him that he is in fact gay and he even tried activism when he was in college.
So if Sherlock was gay and a genius he definitely knew that John liked him... like that. And if that's the case John should accept this rejection.
However... there were days when John still was dreaming about them together. When days like that came he was rethinking everything again. Maybe he should try? After all Sherlock was always very nice to him, and he wasn't nice to anybody (at least no without any intentions).
'Oh, fuck it! I'll ask him today!' John screamed and blushed. Vocalizing his thought wasn't intentional.
'Who will you ask what?' Sherlock asked and John jumped in his seat. He hasn't realized he wasn't alone anymore.
'How long have you been here?!'
'About ten minutes' Sherlock said scanning John with his eyes. 'I thought it's not a problem I spend time in my apartment.'
'No, sorry. I just thought you said you would come back late.'
'My plans changed. I haven't realized Molly's boss has cameras. He saw me setting a corpse on fire and called security.'
'You did what?'
'Oh come on, John. Don't look surprised. I had everything under control.' He shook his head. 'What do you wanted to tell me?'
'How do you know it was...' John didn't finish his sentence as Sherlock raised his eyebrow. 'Yeah, nothing... I just wanted to ask you how are your injuries healing.'
'They are fine, John. But I know you are lying.' He looked on John in silence and sighted. 'Well, if you don't want to tell me I'm going to go rest in my room.' Sherlock walked out of the room.
'Stop! I wanted to ask if you want go with me to Mike's party.' John blurted the words before he could stop himself.
'Yeah, sure. When should we leave?'
'About nine o clock.'
'So we have eight hours... Okay.'
Sherlock left Watson in shock. He wasn't ready for this. Did he just ask Sherlock on a date? No, of course not, it's just a party. But what does Sherlock thinks. They really need to talk about... all of this.

Let's make things clear. John was nervous. Extremely nervous. He just asked Sherlock out on a date. How did he do that? Why? He hadn't planned it. It just... happened. Well, maybe that's how life works. Maybe it just happens. John wasn't satisfied with that explanation, he was pacing in front of his mirror checking how his hair looks. It was fine. Same as the shirt he decided to wear. Unfortunately, John wasn't comforted by these facts. Not when Sherlock wasn't there. To be fair it was only five past nine, so it was not a big deal at all. Also, it's not like there is a fixed time when everyone shows up. Even if they came an hour later than the rest nothing would happen. John knew all of that. Deep down he knew, that it isn't the party he is worried about. He was worried about what can happen afterward. He planned that he would tell Sherlock what he feels in the cab on the way back. That sounded logical. They will sit together for a set amount of time, so Sherlock would have to listen. And if it goes wrong he can just say he is sleepy and go to his room avoiding any awkward conversations.John knew the plan was good, he was just worried.'John?' Sherlock shouted through the door 'Sorry I'm late, I only need a minute and we can leave.' Sherlock left in the bathroom before John could answer. In a few minutes, they were sitting in a cab.'Who is Mike?' asked Sherlock'Who?' John was repeating what he wanted to say and wasn't paying attention.'Mike. The one who invited you to the party we are currently going to.' 'Oh, he is a friend from work. We don't talk much, but I guess he likes me. I help him a lot. He is two years older than me and has a wife - Vanessa. I don't know if she'll be there, she is also a doctor, but works in a different hospital.'Sherlock nodded. The rest of the ride they spent in silence.

'Hi! I am happy you came!' The tall man shouted to out-yell loud music. 'Who are you with?' He asked pointing at Sherlock.'It's my friend! Sherlock!' John answer. 'Here! That's for you!'Cool! Thanks' Mike said as he received the gift. 'Almost everyone's here!''I see!' John nodded and looked at the crowd. There were about thirty people in the room. He recognized about a third of them. People were dancing. It was a nice place, but the music was definitely too loud, John also didn't like the fact that people were smoking inside. He hated the smell. Secretly, he was also afraid of them. He was worried someone may get burned. It wasn't an irrational fear. It happens once to him when he was in college. He was at the party and a girl he was making out with setting his jacket on fire. Fortunately, he realized something it's wrong and took it off quickly, but the fear stayed. He shook his head and decided to get a drink from him and for Sherlock.Holding to glasses of beer, he tried to find his friend in the crowd. He found him looking uncomfortable, talking to a stranger in the quieter area. He approached them in the middle of the conversation.'Here's a beer for you.' He handed a drink to Sherlock. 'Hi! My name is John. I know Mike from work.' He smiled at the man.'I'm Steven. I studied with Mike.' The man responded and continued. 'I was telling your friend why gay couples shouldn't adopt children. You see. I'm a psychiatrist and I work with children. I'd know.''Ohh...' John was struck by this answer'Can you imagine, this guy disagrees with me?' John could imagine that.'Yeah, well I heard Mike was looking for you.' 'Really?''I've just talked to him. He was over there.' John pointed to the furthest corner of the local.'Thanks, man.' Steve said and wobbled through the room.'Are you ok?' John asked and touched Sherlock's arm'I'm fine, John. I didn't need a rescue. I would be fine.' John noticed a hint of annoyance in his voice, but overall Sherlock seemed relieved.'I'm sure you would. I just didn't want him to ruin our evening.' He smiled softly. 'Do you want to have some shots?''We just... sure, why not.' Sherlock agreed and they began their journey to the bar. It seemed that right now there were much more people than before, so already crowded room became very difficult to go through. They succeeded in their mission and happily drunk a couple of rounds. Later John has to go to the loo and when he came back Sherlock was nowhere to be found. After some time he finally found Sherlock. Surprisingly, once again he was talking with Steve. This time the man was even drunker. 'And that's just wrong!' He shouted. 'They want to have kids, but they put penises in their bottoms. But you know what's weird? I had a penis in my girlfriend's bottom. Can you imagine?!' He was speaking very loudly. Sherlock understandably uncomfortable was just standing there observing John's struggles to find his way through the crowd.'Hi John!' said Sherlock theatrically and make a step towards his friend. Then, before John could realize what's happening he kissed him on the lips. John, surprised, but happy, closed the space between there and embraced Sherlock in a tight hug. It could go longer, but suddenly they heard Steve vomiting, so they stepped back.'We should go back.' said John to Sherlock's ear, still holding him by his waist.'Yeah.' said Sherlock with satisfactionThey left the building, the streets were empty, there were few cars, but no cabs, so after some time they decided that they should start walking home.John gathered all of his courage and started. 'I wanted to talk to you about something.' 'I'm listening.''I wanted to ask you out, I... I'm not sure how you'd react, but... well I need to tell you this anyway. I was silent for too long. So...' John took a big breath and looked at Sherlock. The taller man was listening carefully. 'I think I am in love with you. Well, I'm sure I am. And I wanted to ask if you are too.'Sherlock smiled and pulled John closer to him. He looked him into the eyes, their faces were just as close as they can be without touching. 'Yes, I am.' He whispered and kissed him.John was struck. Was he waiting all those years feeling he should stop fantasizing about Sherlock just to learn he liked him back? The kiss ended and they continued to walk. This time holding hands.'I also wanted to say I'm sorry.''Oh?' This time Sherlock looked surprised'I mean when I asked you about your... chest. I shouldn't have. Sorry. I want you to know I respect you and I don't want to make you uncomfortable.' He wasn't looking into Sherlock's eyes. If he did, he would see Sherlock's smile.'It's okay, John. It just wasn't the best time. I wasn't prepared. And... it's not as easy as one may think. Especially cis dude like you. No offense.' He looked at John. 'I see you are trying to be the best you can, I appreciate that.'When they returned to their apartment Sherlock offered to make tea. John agreed, so here there were. In the kitchen, drinking tea, in the middle of the night. John noticed Sherlock's shaking a bit. He also felt cold, so he moved his chair so their legs can touch.Their cups were empty they still were sitting together. Talking about some childhood memories and stupid people. Before anyone realized Sherlock had his hand on John's tight. He wasn't doing anything, just gently stroking John's leg, slowly moving towards his groin, while keeping looking deep into John's eyes. 'Do you want to take off your pants?' Sherlock asked. John smiled and without any further hesitation pulled his jeans down and throw them on the floor. 'Let's go to the bedroom.' He offered. Without splitting apart they've managed to lay on the bed. 'Can I see you naked?' John asked but after seeing Sherlock's frown he added quickly 'Only if you want to, we don't...''Shush... It's fine. Just... remember I am a man.' Sherlock pulled down his pants as John unbuttoned his shirt, kissing his partner on the neck.'I love you.' John purred'I love you too' said Sherlock and went down on John's penis. John moaned as Sherlock licked the head of his erection. John kissed his partner and embraced him. Sherlock started to rub his tights on John's genitals. John reached Sherlock's crotch with his hand and started rubbing his clitoris. 'Is it all right?' He asked'Yeah, you can go inside.' Sherlock whispered and kissed his neck.'Lube?' John asked and, as Sherlock nodded, he reached to his nightstand for a bottle.

Ok, so I decided to flip perspectives, cause I got tired of John. (Sorry if you liked him.)


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Sherlock woke up sore. His head was pulsing; he felt nauseous and dizzy. Carefully he stands up and walked to the bathroom. After seeing his reflection in the mirror he decided to take a shower. He looked at his chest and shivered, but started to peel off his tapes. He turned on hot water. As the glue soaked it was easier but still painful. He washed his hair and naked walked out of the bathroom. He walked into his room and found some comfortable clothes. Tight, but a flexible tank top and a loose shirt. If he had to point one thing he hated more than stupid people he would say binders. They made his back hurt and his arms lose mobility, which was an awful prize for effects that could be achieved for less. He combed his wet hair and walked to the kitchen. He still felt sick, but a cup of tea made it a little bit better. When John woke up, Sherlock was writing responses for his clients. Some of their problems, 'mysteries' as they stupidly called them could be solved by text. Clients didn't appreciate the way Sherlock has been treating them, but who really cared. Sherlock wasn't doing it for money anyway.'Good morning, John.' He said without raising his eyes.'Hi' John answered with a big smile on his face. 'What are you up to?''Nothing, I've been just wondering...' Sherlock bit his lip. 'Do you remember yesterday?''Yeah, I do.' John smiled and blushed, but as Sherlock wasn't smiling he asked. 'Is something wrong?''No! It's great. I'm happy we did it, John.' Sherlock reassured his friend. 'But I wanted to talk about it. Yesterday we were drunk, but now... what are we going to do about it?''Well, what I've said wasn't fully spontaneous, so... if you want we can... continue?' He waited for Sherlock's reaction, but the other man remained silent. 'Sherlock? Are you sure everything's fine? Have I done something wrong?' 'No... You haven't done anything wrong, but... I feel we need to really talk about it. Like... how do you imagine dating me?' Sherlock avoided eye contact.'I mean... probably quite similar to how our friendship looks now, but with sex and kissing.' John's straightforward answer made Sherlock laugh.'I was asking about how do you imagine dating me since I am transgender, John.' He quickly returned to a serious tone.'Yeah... Well, I don't imagine it would cause any problems. I love you, Sherlock. I've loved you when I didn't know you're transgender and I love you now. But like... if you have something you want to clarify I am always ready for listening.'Sherlock stand up and kissed John softly.'Maybe later.' He wanted to hug, John, but the shorter man stepped back.Sherlock almost started to worry, but John kneeled down. 'Sherlock, will you be my boyfriend?' Sherlock laughed and kissed John's forehead. 'I will.'

Ok, so this is the last chapter of this story (for now, as I have an exam coming in few weeks). And... I hope you enjoyed it and you are not mad at me about where the end is. There are chances I publish a second part (if I do it'll be shown somewhere), but I'm quite happy how I closed my main point of the story.","['ch3rry9012', 'toujourspurr', 'Kaxlie', 'Julietneko', 'AlisonTramontin']",['Julietneko']

Siada, gwaltownie lapiac powietrze i probujac uchwycic obrazy szybko rozpraszajace sie z powrotem w cieniu jego umyslu. Plynaca przez niego adrenalina sprawia, ze ma ochote wyskoczyc z lozka i biec, ale czuje sie tak, jakby przebiegl juz bardzo wiele kilometrow. Mruga w ciemnosci, szukajac czegos znajomego, czegos co rozproszy jego dezorientacje, ale nigdy w zyciu nie widzial tego mieszkania.

Siedzi na lozku, z poscieli wydobywa sie mdly zapach wody kolonskiej, ktorego nie rozpoznaje. Potrafi w ciemnosci dostrzec maly aneks kuchenny i ksztalt fotela. To raczej nie jest hotel, ale zbyt za ciasno tu na salon. Chyba ... kawalerka?

Wierci sie, i czuje na przylegajacej do jego ciala koszuli ogromna, mokra plame po srodku klatki piersiowej, ktora zaczela juz zasychac na brzegach. Gleboki, ciemny szkarlat, niemal czarny w slabym swietle ksiezyca wpadajacym przez zakurzone zaluzje. Slyszy w uszach pulsujaca krew, gdy przyglada sie temu i przeszywa go dreszcz. Ostroznie odsuwa material z klatki piersiowej i brzucha, delikatnie przesuwajac palcami, kataloguje uwaznie swoje cialo, szukajac zrodla krwi. Jest jej tak wiele... jakby sie w niej kapal. Jest niejasno swiadomy, ze logicznie rzecz biorac powinien panikowac, ale jego umysl  jakby tonie we mgle.

Przesuwa sie powoli, czekajac, az pociagniecie rany spowoduje uderzenie pioruna przeszywajacego bolu; ale jedyne co go boli, to jego pulsujaca glowa i nie wydaje sie, aby to z niej krwawil.

Dracymi rekami klepie sie po kieszeniach, wyczuwajac z ulga ksztalt telefonu. Wyciagajac go, dzwoni do jedynej osoby, ktora chcialo mu sie zaprogramowac w kontaktach.

- Sherlock? - glos Johna jest ochryply od snu.

Sherlock odsuwa telefon i mruzy oczy; na ekranie jest 04:22.

- John  - zaczyna, ale oddech dlawi go w gardle. Teraz caly sie trzesie, dreszcz  przebiega przez jego cialo, saczy sie az do kosci. Jest mu tak strasznie zimno.

John natychmiast staje sie bardziej czujny. - Co sie stalo?

Jezyk Sherlocka jest sucha, niezdarna rzecza w jego ustach. - Ja... nie wiem...

Na drugim koncu linii jest ruch; slychac zamykajace sie drzwi.  Sherlock moze sobie wyobrazic Johna stojacego na podescie przed swoja sypialnia, aby nie zbudzic Rosie.

- Gdzie jestes? - pyta John. Teraz brzmi czujnie, a nawet naglaco.

- Sadze, ze jestem chyba ... w czyims mieszkaniu - odpowiada Sherlock, marszczac brwi wobec wlasnych niespojnych mysli.

Wstaje na slabe, trzesace sie nogi i podchodzi do malego biurka w rogu. Poczta jest rozrzucona na calej powierzchni blatu zrobionego z wyszczerbionej plyty wiorowej.

- W czyim mieszkaniu? - pyta John.

Jego szorstki, zatroskany glos wydaje sie byc tym, co wyprowadza Sherlocka z oparow jego zamglonego umyslu.

- W mieszkaniu Darrena Mathera - odpowiada mechanicznie Sherlock, odczytujac nazwisko z kopert. - W... Islington?

- Kim jest Darren Mather?

Sherlock jest pewien, ze nigdy wczesniej nie slyszal tego nazwiska. - Nie wiem.

- Sherlock, przerazasz mnie. Jestes tam sam?

Znowu sie rozglada, chociaz mala przestrzen nie mogla ukryc innej osoby.

- Tak, jestem sam. Wlasnie sie tu obudzilem -  bierze gleboki oddech. Czuje sie taki zdezorientowany, taki nierealny - Jest tu... sporo krwi. I ja ... ja jestem niemal caly w niej.

- Chryste, co sie stalo? Jestes ranny? Podaj mi adres, zadzwonie pod 999 ...!

- Nie, John ... ja... -  urywa, myslac z wysilkiem, lecz w umysl zaczyna wkradac sie panika. - Nie sadze, zeby to byla moja krew.

Cisza wisi miedzy nimi, zanim John glosno przelknie. - Podaj mi adres; juz jade.

 

          ***

 

Budynek jest ciemny i obskurny, w powietrzu unosi sie ciezki zapach plesni. Przypomina Johnowi budynek, w ktorym wynajmowal kawalerke w czasach przed Sherlockiem: stara farba odpadajaca ze scian, migoczace zielonkawe lampy w korytarzach, mrukliwi lokatorzy.

Johnowi zoladek sciska sie, gdy widzi, ze drzwi do mieszkania numer cztery sa uchylone. Wiele moglo sie wydarzyc w ciagu tych trzydziestu minut, jakie zajelo mu dotarcie na Islington z Baker Street. Czy Sherlock musial uciekac? A moze lokator wrocil?

Wyciaga reke, aby chwycic pistolet wetkniety za pasek dzinsow, poprawia mala torbe przewieszona przez ramie i powoli otwiera drzwi.

Przed switem pokoj oswietla przytlumione, szare swiatlo. To niewielka przestrzen: maly stolik z jednym krzeslem przy scianie w poblizu skromnie umeblowanej kuchni. Na niektorych haczykach na scianie wisza przypadkowe elementy garderoby, a do sciany przylega male, niechlujne pojedyncze lozko. Pusto.

- Sherlock?! -  John wola ostroznie, zanim zarejestruje jednostajny szum dochodzacy zza jedynych w tym pomieszczeniu drzwi. Prysznic jest w uzyciu.

Chowa bron, puka i wolno otwiera drzwi.

- Sherlock?

Potwierdzajacy pomruk, prawie zagluszony przez bulgoczaca wode.

- Moge wejsc?

Znowu pomruk, ktory niejasno przypomina potwierdzenie.

Ubrania Sherlocka leza w stosie na podlodze, co jest tak niepodobne do niego, ze John patrzy przez chwile ponad nimi, az szkarlatne plamy przyciagaja jego uwage. Choc ubranie jest pogniecione, John moze dostrzec duze, niemal zaschniete, ciemnoczerwone plamy, ktore wsiakly w jego koszule. Podnosi ja i rejestruje iz opadla mu szczeka z powodu ilosci krwi, ktora dojrzal.

- Jezu, Sherlock... czy ty... jestes pewien, ze nie jestes ranny?

- N-n-nie - odpowiada Sherlock, szczekajac zebami. Jego glos jest niski i dobiega gdzies z dolu. John odsuwa nieco zaslone i widzi przez pare wodna, dlugie palce u nog i kolana oraz mocno owiniete wokol nich ramiona Sherlocka. Siedzi on na dnie brodzika, skulony tak mocno, jak tylko moze. Goraca woda lecaca z prysznica parzy jego skore do czerwonosci i napelnia pomieszczenie para, ale Sherlock drzy gwaltownie, jakby przenikaly go ogromne dreszcze.

- Jest mi tak ... z-zimno - udaje mu sie powiedziec gdy patrzy na Johna spod ociekajacych woda ciemnych lokow.

- Drzenie neurogenne  - mamrocze John do siebie. Wypaczona ewolucyjnie wersja walki lub ucieczki. Powodz hormonow stresu, wywolujaca drzenie miesni glebokich. Siega do srodka i zakreca prysznic. Glowa Sherlocka opada na trzesace sie kolana, ktore uderzaja o siebie pod dygoczacymi ramionami.

John chwyta dwa reczniki z polki pod zlewem i kladzie jeden na ramionach Sherlocka, a drugi na krawedzi brodzika. - Wytrzyj sie, przynioslem ci czyste ubranie. Gdy sie uspokoisz, zrobi sie tobie cieplej.

Sherlock marszczy brwi.

 -Jestem spo-kojny - protestuje, ale jego przekonanie ginie w drzeniu jego glosu.

Przeczesujac dlonia wlosy, John bierze gleboki oddech i wycofuje sie z powrotem do pokoju.

Wszystko wyglada pozornie normalnie i widac, ze w mieszkaniu ktos na co dzien rezyduje; jest balagan, stosy poczty, kilka rozrzuconych ubran, naczynia w zlewie i niezaslane lozko. Nie jest to miejsce, ktorym mozna by sie chwalic. John jest nagle bardzo wdzieczny za ich domostwo przy Baker Street.

Drzwi do lazienki otwieraja sie ze skrzypieniem i pojawia sie Sherlock, z recznikiem zawiazanym wokol talii i drugim owinietym wokol ramion; widac, ze wciaz ma dreszcze.

- Siadaj - poleca John, podprowadzajac go w nogi lozka. Z bliska widzi plamy na poduszce i przescieradle, nie od razu zauwazalne na tle ciemnego koloru. Unosi podbrodek Sherlocka, zeby spojrzec mu w oczy. Obie zrenice wydaja sie byc tej samej wielkosci i normalnie reaguja na swiatlo. John zaluje, ze nie mial tyle rozsadku, by zabrac ze soba cala torbe medyczna.  - Wodz wzrokiem za moim palcem - mowi cicho John, a Sherlock robi to bez narzekania. Doktor kladzie palce na szyi Sherlocka mierzac mu puls, ktory jest nieco podwyzszony, ale nie niepokojaco. Kilka analogicznych nastepujacych po stresie uwarunkowan. Cisnienie krwi tez jest w normie, sadzac po tym, jak latwo bylo odnalezc tetno dystalne.* 

- Masz mdlosci? Jestes oszolomiony? - docieka dalej.

- Nie - odpowiada cicho Sherlock - Chociaz ocknalem sie w tym lozku z okropnym bolem glowy.

- A ten co tu mieszka? Darren Mather? Jestes pewien, ze go tu nie bylo?

- Kiedy sie obudzilem, bylem sam ... ale... nie pamietam niczego wczesniej.

- Jaka jest ostatnia rzecz, ktora pamietasz?

- Zjedlismy curry na obiad - mowi Sherlock, ze zmarszczonymi brwiami i nieobecnym spojrzeniem.

- To bylo dwa dni temu - odpowiada John. - Powiedziales mi, ze zamierzasz odwiedzic rodzicow i pojedziesz wieczornym pociagiem. Przypuszczam, ze do nich nie dotarles.

Sherlock wymamrotal cos potakujaco, lecz z lekkim roztargnieniem.

- Wlasciwe pytanie - buczy z sarkazmem John - brzmi: czy w ogole  kiedykolwiek zamierzales tam dotrzec.

Sherlock wzrusza ramionami i kreci glowa, po czym wydaje z siebie sfrustrowany pomruk i chwyta sie za skronie.

Jego frustracja, jego tak bardzo nietypowa, zatrwazajaca nieswiadomosc wydaje sie autentyczna Johnowi, ktory pochyla sie, szukajac kontaktu wzrokowego. - Razi cie swiatlo?

- Nie.  Ja po prostu... nic nie pamietam. To irytujace.

Uraz glowy latwo by to wszystko wyjasnil, wiec John podnosi glowe Sherlocka do gory i przeczesuje palcami jego wilgotne loki, sprawdzajac, czy nie ma guzow lub skaleczen, ale nic nie znajduje. Cofa sie, nastepne pytanie utyka mu w gardle. - Czy... brales cos?

-Nie.

- Przeciez mowiles, ze nic pamietasz.

- Wiec po co mnie o to pytasz? -  warczy Sherlock. Wypuszcza sfrustrowany oddech. - Gdybym nawet  to zrobil ... gdybym cos wzial - szydzi - nie ma na to zadnych dowodow.

 Prycha niecierpliwie, kiedy widzi, jak oczy Johna przesuwaja sie do zgiecia jego ramienia. - Mozesz sobie sprawdzic, jesli mi nie wierzysz.

- Sherlock, wiesz rownie dobrze jak ja, ze halucynogeny nie sa zazwyczaj wstrzykiwane. Mozna je rowniez podawac w sposob, ktorego moglbys nie zauwazyc.

Sherlock szturcha go w ramie palcem wskazujacym. - Jestes realny, a wiec najwyrazniej nie mam halucynacji na temat ciebie tutaj, ani nie doswiadczam zadnych objawow wskazujacych na oslabienie po dawce stymulantow badz opiatow.

John unosi rece w gescie poddania sie.  - I jestes pewien, ze nie masz zadnych zranien ani siniakow? - pyta, chociaz Sherlock jest teraz owiniety recznikami  tylko w pasie, wiec John widzi to na wlasne oczy.

- Zadnych.

- Nie boli cie brzuch?

- Odrobine sie zdenerwowalem - mruczy niechetnie Sherlock.

- W porzadku - mowi John, trac czolo. Podnosi torbe, ktora przyniosl z miejsca przy drzwiach, rozpina ja i kladzie stos ubran na lozku obok Sherlocka. - Ubieraj sie. Zalatwie nam taksowke - Wyciaga komorke i otwiera aplikacje z mapami. - Mysle, ze Whittington jest niedaleko stad.

Glowa Sherlocka podskakuje do gory. - Whittington? Jak szpital w Whittington?

John zmierza go swoim najlepszym spojrzeniem typu ,,nawet nie probuj"".  - Tak. Oczywiscie, musimy ...

- Nie jade do zadnego szpitala! - wykrzykuje Sherlock, odskakujac, by wstac i majac nadzieje, ze John nie zauwazy, kiedy chwieje sie przez chwile.

- Sherlock, posluchaj mnie - blaga John. - Musi cie obejrzec neurolog. To jest powazne: nie pamietasz znacznej czesci czasu, masz silny bol glowy, twoje dzialania i mysli sa spowolnione ...

Sherlockowi opada szczeka. - Moje mysli z pewnoscia NIE sa spowolnione!

Brwi Johna unosza sie  - Serio? To powiedz mi: jak zarabia na zycie Darren Mather?

Oczy Sherlocka biegaja po pokoju, probujac uchwycic wskazowki, znalezc powiazania, ale John widzi, ze konczy sie to niepowodzeniem. W pokoju panuje balagan, wokol rozsianych jest wystarczajaco duzo dowodow, tak ze Sherlock zwykle juz zorientowalby sie w historii zycia tego mezczyzny.

John kreci glowa. - Nie udalo ci sie wydedukowac ani jednej rzeczy o tej sytuacji, o tej kawalerce, o jej mieszkancu, ani o tym skad tyle krwi na twoim ubraniu. A moze wlasnie zapomniales wspomniec o swoich odkryciach? To raczej nie lezy w twojej naturze, moglbym dodac. Geniusz potrzebuje publicznosci i tak dalej.

Sherlock patrzy gniewnie, ale jego milczenie mowi wiele. Nie moze ukryc swojego oszolomienia przed kims, kto zna go tak dobrze, jak John.

- To moze byc oznaka problemu z doplywem krwi do mozgu lub wirusa ... moze zapalenia mozgu. Mozliwy jest rowniez atak epileptyczny. Nawet jesli to TGA**  to diagnoza ustalana jest przez wykluczenie wielu innych rzeczy  - jednak zdecydowanie odpedza mysl o guzach mozgu i tetniakach. - A co, jesli wykaszlales cala te krew? Moglo to byc krwawienie z przewodu pokarmowego - zwraca uwage.

Jednak John watpi, ze tak jest, poniewaz zauwazylby znajomy, obrzydliwie mdlacy zapach wymiocin zmieszanych z zakrzepla krwia, ale Sherlock w jego obecnym stanie wydaje sie zbyt oszolomiony by kontrargumentowac. Zwykle jest bardzo bystry, jesli chodzi o sprawy medyczne, wiec jego brak dyskusji jest alarmujaco godny uwagi.

 - Niezaleznie od tego, musisz byc zbadany w szpitalu. Jedziemy taksowka albo wzywam karetke. Twoj wybor.

Sherlock zaciska szczeke, zrzuca recznik i siega po stos ubran. Koszula i spodnie sa lekko wygniecione, ale na szczescie gatki sa czyste.

- Zlapalem pierwsze twoje ciuchy, ktore znalazlem na szczycie wypranego stosu w lazience - mowi przepraszajaco John, obserwujac Sherlocka ostroznym okiem lekarza. - Nie chcialem tracic czasu na dotarcie do ciebie, a musialem jeszcze sprawdzic, co z Rosie i zaniesc elektroniczna nianie do pani Hudson ... - urywa, przekonany, ze jego pacjent jednak nie upadnie, i odwraca sie z powrotem, by dac Sherlockowi odrobine prywatnosci.

Sherlock podnosi torbe, a John podejrzewa, ze ma nadzieje znalezc tam przybory toaletowe. Bez pewnego produktu jego wlosy sa szybko schnaca, kedzierzawa katastrofa, ale w torbie nie ma juz nic wiecej, poniewaz John o tym nie pomyslal, no i w sumie nie to bylo priorytetem.

- Moj plaszcz? - pyta Sherlock, rozgladajac sie po pokoju.

John kreci glowa. - Nie bylo go w twoim pokoju ani na wieszaku przy drzwiach. Mysle, ze bym go nie przeoczyl. Jestem pewien, ze miales go przy sobie, kiedy wyjezdzales.

W torbie pozostaly juz tylko buty. John odwraca sie, kiedy slyszy, jak uderzaja o podloge i bez slowa wskazuje Sherlockowi, ze powinien znowu usiasc.

- Nic mi nie jest - protestuje Sherlock, ale John tylko zaciska usta i patrzy na niego przez chwile, zanim ustapi. Doktor kleka i wsuwa buty na stopy Sherlocka, zawiazujac sznurowki szybko i mocno. Wstaje i wyciaga reke.

Sherlock patrzy na to i wzdycha znaczaco, po czym staje sam. - John, przysiegam ci, nic mi nie jest. Jesli popelniono przestepstwo, a ja tam bylem, to musze wiedziec, co sie stalo. I musimy to zrobic teraz, zanim Met zlapie wiatr w zagle i zanieczysci moje miejsce zbrodni.

- Obiecuje ci, ze poznasz wszystkie szczegoly. Ale najpierw musimy sie upewnic, ze z toba wszystko w porzadku. Problemy neurologiczne moga szybko postepowac. Tetniaki potrafia sie pojawic w mgnieniu oka. Nie mamy czasu do stracenia. Jesli nadal chcesz sie o to klocic, to mozesz to robic na tylnym siedzeniu taksowki.

John wyczekujaco przytrzymuje skrzydlo drzwi dla Sherlocka.

- Moje ubrania? - pyta Sherlock, spogladajac w strone lazienki.

John oblizuje usta i przez chwile spoglada w dol. - Sa przeciez dowodami. Powinnismy je zostawic. Kiedy dotrzemy do szpitala, zadzwonimy do Lestrada i poinformujemy go, co sie stalo.

- Ale my wiemy, co sie stalo.

- Nie  - zgadza sie John - ale to nie wyglada dobrze. I chce miec pewnosc, ze cokolwiek wydarzy sie pozniej, bedziemy miec kogos po naszej stronie od poczatku tej sprawy.

- Ja nikogo nie ...

- Jasne, ze nie - mowi szybko i szczerze John, ale jego wyraz twarzy jest ponury. - Ale to nie mnie byc moze bedziesz musial przekonywac.

Spojrzenie, ktore rzuca mu Sherlock, mowi Johnowi, iz wie, ze doktor ma racje.

Jest jeszcze pewna rzecz. Jeszcze tylko jedna rzecz, ktora nalezy omowic, ale to jest ta najtrudniejsza. John przelyka sline, wyciaga reke, by powstrzymac Sherlocka przed wyjsciem. Zoladek lekko mu sie skreca na mysl o tym, co musi powiedziec.  - Kiedy dotrzemy do Whittington, mysle, ze powinienes rowniez rozwazyc badanie na okolicznosc zgwalcenia.

Oczy Sherlocka blyskaja zaskoczeniem, a potem zaprzecza. - Nie.

John powoli wypuszcza powietrze, aby dac sobie czas na znalezienie wlasciwych argumentow. Musi odwolac sie do logiki. - Budzisz sie w obcym lozku, w obcym mieszkaniu, nie majac pojecia, co sie wydarzylo. Nie masz zadnych widocznych obrazen, wiec ktos mogl cie odurzyc. Jaki jest najczestszy cel, dla ktorego ludzie robia takie rzeczy innym?

Taka mozliwosc przyszla Johnowi na mysl, odkad uslyszal odglos lecacej z prysznica wody. Widok Sherlocka trzesacego sie pod goracym prysznicem sprawil, ze podejrzewal tez wstrzas hipowolemiczny***  jako jedna z mozliwosci, ale woda splywala do odplywu juz czysta. Mimo to mysl, ze ktos moglby skrzywdzic Sherlocka w ten sposob, przyprawiala go o mdlosci. Mogla wywiazac sie walka. Napastnik zblizajacy sie do Sherlocka, krwawil z ust lub nosa i to moglo byc przyczyna czesci krwawych plam na jego koszuli.

- Myslisz, ze nie zauwazylbym ... ze poczulbym tego teraz, gdyby cos takiego mialo ...  - mowi zdenerwowany Sherlock. - Nic takiego sie nie wydarzylo. Wiedzialbym, gdyby tak sie stalo.

- Dobra - John potakuje. - Przepraszam. Po prostu ... nie chce ryzykowac, jasne?

- Potrzebuje portfela - mowi Sherlock  raptownie zmieniajac temat, obracajac sie na piecie i wbiegajac z powrotem do lazienki. John slyszy szelest, gdy Sherlock grzebie w kieszeniach spodni, a potem wszystko nagle cichnie.

- Sherlock? - glos Johna jest napiety, walczy ze znajomym rozblyskiem asekuracyjnego gniewu. Sherlock wychodzi z lazienki i w milczacej odpowiedzi wyciaga w rece pek kluczy. Stojac przy drzwiach, John widzi kilka metalowych kluczy do domu i stary, porysowany kluczyk samochodowy. Wszystkie sa pokryte krwia, a na breloku z Union Jackiem pojawila sie duza czerwona plama. Unosi brwi, gdy detektyw podchodzi do jedynego malego okienka w kawalerce, naciska przycisk zamka na kluczyku i patrzy, jak w odpowiedzi na to swiatlami miga stary srebrny datsun na ulicy ponizej.

- Sherlock? - tym razem ciszej, ale bardziej niecierpliwie. - Musimy isc.

Im szybciej dotra do szpitala i wykonaja badania laboratoryjne oraz dokladne badania neurologiczne, tym szybciej znajda odpowiedzi.

- Coz, John, mamy szczescie. Wyglada na to, ze nasza podwozka juz tu jest.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Samochod jest w takim samym stanie jak kawalerka; maly, niechlujny, bardzo sfatygowany, lecz wydaje sie byc sprawny. Sherlock otwiera drzwi pasazera i nie marnuje czasu przegladajac schowek, znajduje dowod rejestracyjny.

- To Darrena Mathera? - pyta John obok niego, a Sherlock pomrukuje potwierdzajaco.

Sprawdza reszte smieci walajacych sie po samochodzie: przewody do odpalania akumulatora, kilka opakowan po jedzeniu na wynos  i pusty kubek po kawie. W drugim uchwycie na kubek jest wizytowka: ,,Marissa Delamere - specjalistka psychoterapii holistycznej i odzyskiwania pamieci.""

John podchodzi do drzwi kierowcy i pochyla sie, zeby zajrzec do srodka. - Na kierownicy jest krew - oznajmia ponuro, odwracajac sie, by spojrzec na Sherlocka, ale cos innego przykuwa jego uwage i jego twarz jeszcze bardziej sie nachmurza.  -  A na tylnym siedzeniu lezy cos, co wyglada dokladnie jak twoja torba podrozna.

Sherlock odwraca sie, zeby spojrzec. John ma racje. Wysiada z samochodu, otwiera tylne drzwi i wyjmuje torbe.

- Chryste, Sherlock - wydycha John, przeczesujac dlonia wlosy. Kreci glowa z niedowierzaniem, patrzac na detektywa znad samochodu. - Musimy zadzwonic do Lestrade. Bierzmy taksowke i jedzmy do szpitala. Zadzwonimy do niego po drodze .

Blysk zolci przyciaga wzrok Sherlocka, wiec siega na podloge, by wyciagnac maly, naddarty kawalek zoltego papieru w linie. Adres zapisany odrecznie. Sherlock unosi kartke, marszczac brwi.

John staje obok niego. - Co to jest?

- Adres w Milbury.

- To twoje pismo.

Sherlock wpisuje adres do swojej komorki i mruczy pod nosem - To nie daleko. Mozemy tam byc w mniej niz dwadziescia minut.

Oczy Johna rozszerzaja sie. - O, nie. Absolutnie nie! Jedziemy ...

- Do szpitala; tak, tak. - przerywa mu detektyw - Ale w rzeczywistosci szpital Royal Claringdon znajduje sie tuz obok  i ma lepsza renome, niz ten w Whittington, a jesli pamiec mnie nie myli, wspomniales kiedys, ze znasz kilku tamtejszych lekarzy, co sprawia, ze staje sie on wygodniejsza opcja. Rzut oka, aby sprawdzic dokad prowadza tropy, a nastepnie prosto na izbe przyjec  -  zaczyna isc w strone glownej drogi, by znalezc taksowke, a John biegnie za nim.

Zatrzymuja sie na rogu, Sherlock obserwuje cicha ulice jak jastrzab. John jest niemal siny ze zlosci: ma zacisnieta szczeka, rozdete nozdrza. Potrzasa glowa.  - Nie pojmuje, dlaczego nie traktujesz tego powaznie. Zawsze upierasz sie, ze twoj umysl jest dla ciebie najwazniejszy, a reszta to tylko ,,transport""; ale teraz to wlasnie twoj umysl jest w niebezpieczenstwie, a ty wydajesz  sie tym zupelnie nie przejmowac.

Sherlock obraca sie, by na niego spojrzec.  - Oczywiscie, ze sie przejmuje! Doprowadza mnie to do szalu! Brakuje mi wspomnien z dwoch dni! Ale badzmy szczerzy, John. Ty i ja wiemy, ze to, co odkrylismy do tej pory przedstawia bardzo niefortunny obraz tego, co robilem w tym czasie, ktorego nie pamietam. Zasluguje przynajmniej na szanse, aby sprobowac dowiedziec sie jak najwiecej dla samego siebie, zanim mnie skuja.

- Sherlock, to nie to samo, co wparowanie do szpitala z rana postrzalowa - nie beda mieli powodu, aby wzywac policje, jesli przedstawimy im tylko twoje objawy.

- I zaryzykowac ze slad ostygnie? Ludzie zawsze maja... ludzi, a oni dowiedza sie, co sie stalo z ... z... - trudem probuje przypomniec sobie imie.

- Darrenem Matherem - podpowiada zaniepokojony John.  - Sam widzisz, o co mi chodzi. Nie funkcjonujesz normalnie.

Sherlock z oburzeniem odwraca sie i przywoluje taksowke, ktora wlasnie wylonila sie zza zakretu.

John wypuszcza sfrustrowany oddech przez nos, gdy podjezdza czarna taksowka. - Dobra - ustepuje. - Ale najwyzej piec minut. Potem prosto do szpitala. Zgoda?

Sherlock robi niewinna mine i otwiera drzwi samochodu dla Johna - Slowo skauta - mowi.

 

***

 

467 Hawksmoor Road w Milbury wyglada jakby byla nie na swoim miejscu. Zrujnowana, przewaznie opustoszala ulica w bogatej dzielnicy, niektore biznesiki wciaz tu dzialaja, ale to branze niszowe, istniejace tu juz oczywiscie szmat czasu; warsztat samochodowy, zakurzona wypozyczalnia instrumentow muzycznych i sklep z ubezpieczeniami. Sa tam takze pozostalosci zburzonych budynkow, fragmenty fundamentow,  stosy gruzu i smieci. Wyglada na to, ze gentryfikacja wisi nad tym miejscem jak deszczowa chmura, czekajaca tylko na okazje, aby ulewa oczyscic teren.

Drzwi z numerem 467 to srodkowy z trzech budynkow i niewiele wiecej niz drzwi miedzy dwoma witrynami sklepowymi. Numer 465 wyglada na dawno opuszczony: okna zamalowane, wyblakle informacje o wynajmie przyklejone tasma do drzwi; natomiast 469 to sklep z artykulami uzywanymi, bez polotu nazwany ,,Druga Szansa"". Zaden sklep na ulicy nie jest jeszcze otwarty, slonce wciaz jest stosunkowo nisko na porannym horyzoncie.  Patrzac na strukture budynku, oczywiste jest, ze to, co znajduje sie za drzwiami z numerem 467, to nic innego jak schody prowadzace do wynajmowanego lokalu na pietrze.

- Prosze zaczekac, wracamy za piec minut - mowi  John taksowkarzowi, ktory kiwa glowa ale i przypomina, ze licznik nadal bije.

Zgadzaja sie najpierw rozdzielic i obejrzec zewnetrzna strone budynku, ale gdy tylko John znika za rogiem

wyznaczonego mu boku, Sherlock podbiega z powrotem do taksowki.

- Wyglada na to, ze potrwa to troche dluzej, niz myslelismy - mowi kierowcy, podajac banknot za przejazd przez spuszczona szybe. - Zadzwonimy po inna taksowke, jak juz bedziemy gotowi wracac.

- Jestes pan pewien? - pyta taksowkarz, spogladajac z powatpiewaniem w kierunku, w ktorym poszedl John.

- Tak, zdecydowanie. To troche potrwa.

Taksowkarz wzrusza ramionami i odjezdza. Chwile pozniej John wraca ze swej ,,wyprawy"" dookola budynku i zaczyna biec, gdy widzi oddalajace sie tylne swiatla taksowki.

- Ej!

Sherlock robi krok do przodu, by spotkac podbiegajacego Johna.

- Prosilem, zeby zaczekal!

- A ja mu powiedzialem, ze nie musi. Zadzwonimy po inna, gdy skonczymy.

- Niech cie cholera Sherlock!

- To miejsce wydaje mi sie znajome, John. To tak, jakby wspomnienie bylo gdzies z tylu mojej glowy, jestem juz blisko, by je zlapac. Musimy wejsc do srodka.

- Ta sytuacja jest juz wystarczajaco zla bez aresztowania nas za wlamanie. Jesli to, co tam ewentualnie znajdziemy, ma zwiazek z... z tym, co ci sie przydarzylo w ciagu ostatnich dwoch dni...

Nagle, bez ostrzezenia, ogromny bol przeszywa glowe Sherlocka jak blyskawica. Nie moze powstrzymac sie od krzyku, chwytajac sie za skronie w daremnej probie powstrzymania udreki.

Czuje rece Johna na swoich ramionach, slyszy jego spanikowany glos wolajacy go po imieniu, ale rzeczywistosc znika, a otoczenie sie oddala.

 

 


Znowu krzyczy i lzy splywaja mu teraz po twarzy. Plomienie sie zblizaja, pomieszczenie pochlania pieklo. Na chwile zostaje oszolomiony, gdy stoi przy drzwiach i patrzy, jak posciel na jego lozku zapala sie. Raz jeszcze ciagnie i przekreca klamke. - MYCROFT! - krzyczy.



Eurus stoi przed nim, beznamietne oczy wbijaja w niego spojrzenie spomiedzy podskakujacych warkoczykow. - To  ze mna masz sie bawic - mowi, ale to jest tak, jakby ogien przemawial do niego, a nie mala dziewczynka; jej slowa hucza i trzaskaja. - A on niech sobie idzie do domu! - Victor odwzajemnia jej spojrzenie ze zloscia, po czym oddala sie w kierunku plazy ze swoim mieczem w rece. Placze.



Nagle plomienie znikaja, i jego ulubiona pluszowa zabawka jest na lozku, ale cos jest nie tak, poniewaz wspomnienie nie moze pochodzic z tego samego dnia. Zweglone, rozmoczone szczatki czegos, co kiedys bylo trzmielem, miekkie zolto-czarne futerko, podarowane mu przez babcie, gdy sie urodzil. To grozba.



Widzi, jak Mycroft stoi przed ich rodzicami; skads wzial sie na dole schodow.



Matka trzyma glowe w dloniach, ojciec jest odwrocony plecami, wpatrujac sie w huczacy ogniem kominek.



- Ona wami manipuluje! - krzyczy Mycroft i zamiast swojego doroslego brata, Sherlock widzi Mycrofta -jedenastolatka. Przyjechal ze szkoly, gdy Victor zaginal. 



Tatus jest wsciekly: - Przyjada po niego wieczorem i koniec! Tak bedzie najbezpieczniej dla nas wszystkich!  



Wydaje sie, jakby Sherlock nie rozumial tych slow. Mycroft odwraca sie lekko i widzi Sherlocka na schodach. Spotykaja sie  wzrokiem na chwile, zanim Sherlock ucieka z powrotem do swojej sypialni.



Zatrzaskuje za soba drzwi. Ale jest przerazony, widzac, ze wrocil w sam srodek  burzy ognia. Drzwi za nim znow sa zamkniete. Plomienie odcinaja mu droge. Jego gardlo plonie od goracego powietrza. Nie jest juz w stanie krzyczec. Nie moze juz oddychac. Nie moze...


 


 


- Sherlock? Sherlock, slyszysz mnie? - dlon na jego twarzy, kciuk glaszczacy go po kosci policzkowej. - Otworz oczy. Dalej Sherlock, otworz oczy. - glos Johna jest rozkazujacy, ale zdesperowany. Czuje zapach szamponu doktora, gdy ten pochyla sie blisko, nasluchujac jego oddechu.

Sherlock w koncu zbiera cala swoja energie, by byc poslusznym. - Dzieki Bogu - dyszy John, gdy Sherlock w koncu otwiera oczy, krzywiac sie na jasnoniebieskie niebo. Lezy plasko na plecach, trawa laskocze go w dlonie, a serce mu wali.

- Wiesz gdzie jestes? - dopytuje sie John, przygladajac mu sie, pochylil sie blizej, aby zbadac odruchy zrenic. - Sherlock? Slyszysz mnie?

Sherlock przelyka sline, probujac otrzasnac sie z dezorientacji, ktora przyszpila jego zdolnosc do jasnego myslenia. - Co sie stalo?

- Zlapales sie za glowe i krzyczales, a potem straciles przytomnosc - mowi John, palcami maca puls na Sherlockowym nadgarstku. - Ledwo cie zlapalem, zebys nie rozbil sobie o cos glowy. Jezu - oddycha ciezko, jakby biegl.

-  Pamietasz, gdzie jestesmy?

- Pojechalismy pod adres z tej notatki, ktora znalazlem w samochodzie Darrena Mathera - odpowiada Sherlock bez wahania, po czym probuje usiasc, ale natychmiast czuje nacisk silnych dloni na ramionach.

 - Mowy nie ma. Lez spokojnie - instruuje John. - Jaka jest ostatnia rzecz, ktora pamietasz?

Sherlock sie poddaje i pozwala Johnowi pomoc mu ulozyc sie na plecach; kreci mu sie w glowie, wiec pomysl wstawania nie wydaje sie zachecajacy.

 - Odjezdzajaca taksowka.

Na twarzy Johna pojawia sie cien. - Tak, cholernie dobra robota. Gdybym nie zgodzil sie na te bzdury, bylibysmy na ostrym dyzurze, kiedy to sie stalo. Jak sie czujesz?

Sherlock probuje sie skoncentrowac, ale macki wspomnien nie odpuszczaja i groza, ze go wciagna. Sa przerazajace, i on potrzebuje Johna, by zatrzymal go w rzeczywistosci. Stara sie wyrazic slowami widoki i dzwieki przelatujace przez jego umysl. - Bylem... znowu bylem dzieckiem... plonal dom, byla tam Eurus i ogien odcial mi droge ... to bylo takie realne.

John marszczy brwi. - Istnieja obszary mozgu, gdzie moga zostac wywolane halucynacje podczas napadow padaczki. Z praktyk na neurologii pamietam pacjentow, ktorzy nawet po jakims czasie pamietali swoje projekcje z napadow.

- Ale to bylo realne wspomnienie, John, jestem tego pewien. To bylo prawdziwe. I nie mialem ataku epilepsji, prawda?

- Nie mozemy tego wiedziec bez EEG*  i bez wykluczenia innych rzeczy. Straciles przytomnosc, a nie wszystkie napady kloniczne**  maja objawy toniczne***  To mogl byc jakis napad nieswiadomosci****

- Nie mam epilepsji John. I czy bole glowy nie powinny wystapic po napadzie, a nie przed nim?

- Dlatego potrzebujemy testow, aby wykluczyc inne rzeczy.

- Na przyklad jakie?

- A to juz ci powie neurolog, Sherlock.

- Teraz czuje sie dobrze.

John szuka w kieszeni telefonu komorkowego. - Zdecydowanie nie jest dobrze. Niespodziewanie straciles przytomnosc i doswiadczyles jakiegos znaczacego wydarzenia mozgowego. Jedziemy do szpitala. Natychmiast.

John w krotkich odstepach wybiera trzy cyferki na swoim telefonie i Sherlock wie, ze nie ma sensu sie klocic. Poza tym rozmowa przyprawia go o zawroty glowy.

- Mowi doktor John Watson; jestem przy 467 Hawksmoor Road w Milbury. Potrzebuje erki dla pacjenta do najblizszego szpitala z oddzialem  neurologicznym. Mezczyzna, lat 37,  bez znanej historii chorob neurologicznych. Mial serie podejrzanych atakow z amnezja. Zadnych trudnosci z mowieniem ani zaburzen funkcji motorycznych, ktore bym zauwazyl. Bardzo krotki, niezwykle silny bol glowy typu napadowego przed utrata przytomnosci.

John marszczy brwi, sluchajac dyspozytora. - Tak, teraz jest przytomny, zrenice symetryczne i reaguja na swiatlo, oddycha normalnie...

Jeszcze przez chwile slucha, po czym zwraca sie do Sherlocka.  - Jakis bol w klatce piersiowej?

- Nie.

John ponownie zwraca sie do dyspozytora. - Nie, bez bolu w klatce piersiowej - Kolejna pauza. - Nudnosci?

Sherlock tym razem probuje usiasc, odpychajac rece Johna i unikajac odpowiedzi na pytanie.  - NIC. MI. NIE JEST - przelyka zolc, ktora juz dlawi go w gardle.

John rzuca mu spojrzenie, ktore mogloby zmrozic pieklo, ale niechetnie pomaga Sherlockowi usiasc, sciskajac telefon miedzy uchem a ramieniem. - Co to za skrzyzowanie? - rozglada sie, mruzac oczy, na slupek z nazwami ulic, stojacy na rogu w oddali  - Nie ruszaj sie - rzuca Sherlockowi, po czym szybko biegnie w kierunku rogu. Tyle czasu wystarcza detektywowi. Zrywa sie bez problemu, zachwycony, ze mysli juz jasniej, a zawroty glowy sa znosne.

- Cholera, Sherlock! -  wrzeszczy John za jego plecami, gdy detektyw podchodzi do drzwi.

- To nie jest wlamanie, jesli mamy klucze - mowi nonszalancko.

- To nawet nie jest prawda - wscieka sie John. - Niedlugo tu beda, powinnismy zostac i czekac.

Na kolku z brelokiem nie ma zbyt wielu kluczy, a Sherlock trafia na wlasciwy juz za drugim podejsciem. Drzwi otwieraja sie, ukazujac dlugie schody, z okien powyzej wpada dzienne swiatlo. Sherlock powoli wchodzi do malego przedpokoju, po czym rusza w gore po schodach, ale John rzuca sie do przodu, i chwyta go za ramie. - Zaszedles juz wystarczajaco daleko. Karetka jest w drodze, chodz, zaczekamy na nia na zewnatrz.

- Kiedy zaroi sie tu od policji, juz nigdy nie obejrze tego miejsca - drzwi zamykaja sie za Johnem, przyciagajac wzrok Sherlocka. Klamka jest z postarzanego mosiadzu, ozdobiona drobnymi rozetami. I jeszcze cos. - Dobra. Ujme to inaczej: moze pozwola mi zobaczyc zdjecia tego lokum jako dowod na moim procesie - dodaje ponuro Sherlock, a John odwraca sie, by spojrzec.

- Jezu, to ...

- Krew, tak. Nie sadze, aby zalozenie, ze moje odciski palcow rowniez gdzies tam sa, bylo bardzo nonsensowne.

Tym razem, gdy Sherlock zaczyna wchodzic po schodach, protest Johna sie zmienia. Bez slowa zatrzymuje Sherlocka i wyprzedza go, by objac dowodzenie.

Wchodza cicho po schodach, znajdujac na szczycie ciche, zatechle studio artystyczne. Poranne slonce wlewa sie przez duze okna wzdluz frontowej sciany, oswietlajac pomieszczenie cieplym swiatlem. Latwo jest dostrzec sylwetki sztalug, na wielu z nich jest cos, co wyglada jak obrazy. John mruzy oczy, gdy jego wzrok dostosowuje sie do swiatla otoczenia.

Wyglada na to, ze Sherlockowi wystarczyla ta chwila, zeby sobie cos skojarzyl, gdy obraca sie  powoli by obejrzec przestrzen. - Pamietam to - mruczy pod nosem. - Coz, niezupelnie, ale wydaje sie to zbyt znajome, aby moglo byc zbiegiem okolicznosci.

- Myslisz, ze byles tu wczesniej?

- Moze.

- Sherlock, deja vu moze byc objawem ucisku w placie skroniow ...

- Zamknij sie i daj mi pomyslec!

Znajduja wlacznik swiatla w poblizu schodow i wreszcie moga lepiej przyjrzec sie temu miejscu. Pokoj jest wypelniony plotnami roznych rozmiarow, niektore na sztalugach, inne ulozone pod scianami. Teczowe plamy z farby akrylowej wygladaja jak rozsiane po podlodze konfetti. Rozrzucone pedzle i palety leza na stolach i stolkach.

- Chryste - mowi John, kiedy widza obrazy. Oglada jeden z nich z chorobliwym zdumieniem: krzyczaca meska postac w absolutnej udrece, odrywajaca sobie twarz.- To jak z horroru - cialo, miesnie i sciegna odrywajace sie od kosci sa w jaskrawych, niepokojaco realistycznych barwach. Tlo jest poprzecinane szerokimi, gwaltownymi pociagnieciami czerni, bieli i czerwieni.

Sherlock podchodzi do kolejnej sztalugi, a potem do nastepnej. - Wszystkie sa takie same - mowi, a John rozglada sie, i stwierdza, ze ma racje. Po pracowni jest porozstawiane co najmniej pietnascie niemal identycznych odmian tego samego obrazu, rozniacych sie w zasadzie tylko rozmiarem plotna.

Oboje odwracaja sie do okien, slyszac w oddali nagle wycie syren, kierujace sie  bez watpienia w ich strone.

John odwraca sie w strone schodow, aby zasugerowac, ze zejda na dol, ale jego stopa zaczepia o jakis material. Masa znajomej ciemnej welny z jaskrawoczerwonymi dziurkami, ktora John widzi kazdego dnia.

- Sherlock, to twoj...

I wtedy to widza. Wielka bordowa kaluza akrylowej farby, konczaca sie na samym plaszczu. W niektorych miejscach nadal lsni wilgocia.

Ida po sladzie do zrodla. Ukryte za stolem warsztatowym i rolkami plotna, lezy cialo bardzo martwego mezczyzny. Zaschnieta krew otacza ziejaca rane na jego szyi. Obok jego dloni lezy zakrwawiony noz rzemieslniczy.

Sherlock ciezko wypuszcza powietrze. - Darren Mather, jak przypuszczam.

Syreny slychac juz dole ulicy. Beda tu lada chwila, a obecnie w londynskie karetki sa eskortowane przez policje.

Spojrzenie Sherlocka jest spanikowane. - Wiejemy. Jesli zobacza, ze wyszlismy stad, kiedy go znajda ...

John chwyta go za ramie i kieruja sie na schody. Kiedy zbiegaja, wyciaga komorke i szybko wybiera numer. - Lestrade? Stalo sie cos. Tak, chodzi o Sherlocka. Czy mozesz sie z nami spotkac na oddziale ratunkowym szpitala Royal Claringdon?

*EEG - Elektroencefalografia jest jednym z podstawowych badan pozwalajacych  ocenic bioelektryczna czynnosc mozgu. EEG glowy wykonuje sie w bardzo specyficznych przypadkach. Przede wszystkim stosuje sie je w diagnostyce epilepsji. Dzieki badaniu mozliwe jest sprawdzenie, jakie formy leczenia beda najbardziej odpowiednie. Niekiedy EEG przydaje sie przy ocenie, w jakim stanie jest mozg po zatruciu srodkami neurotoksycznymi. Wskazaniem do wykonania EEG sa tez zmiany, ktore maja podloze w ukladzie nerwowym. Chodzi tu zwlaszcza o niewyjasnione omdlenia, zaslabniecia, utrate rownowagi czy symptomy dotykajace narzady zmyslow np. zaburzenia wzroku czy sluchu. Badanie EEG zlecane jest rowniez przy czestych bolach glowy.

It compels me to admit that infants, such as yourself, are no better than me when it comes to depending on John for incessant needs and wants without him expecting anything in return."" 

 

Sherlock's voice sounds soft even to his own ears, resonating around the walls of 221B Baker Street, soft, just like the morning light glowing through the curtains, soft, just like the warmth in his heart. Sherlock picks up the baby in front of him and holds her carefully against his chest. He smiles at the tiny human in his arms. A smile which quickly turns into a glare when he sees John smirking behind him. 

 

""Have you been dyeing your hair darker?""

 

John frowns, unconsciously raising a hand to touch his hair. 

 

""What, you don't like it?"" 

 

""You're losing your natural silver streaks, John."" 

 

John simply huffs crossing his arms: ""Gray hair makes me feel old.""

 

Sherlock can't help but roll his eyes: ""You are old."" 

 

""Thanks. Really appreciate that, Sherlock."" John's voice, dripping with sarcasm is at odds with the self-conscious look in his eyes.

 

Sherlock just frowns, confused: ""What's wrong with getting old? Silver hair is part of ageing. I've got grey hair. It doesn't bother me."" 

 

John swiftly looks away: ""I just don't like it on me. Give me a break."" 

 

Sherlock huffs and bounces the child in his arms, disliking John's new look and preferring the previous one. He doesn't know how John can't realize how perfect he already is. In his arms, the baby moves again and Sherlock looks down and smiles. 

 

""At least you have inherited your mother's eyes and hair. That should compensate for the stubbornness you will most definitely inherit from your father.""

 

""Let's not talk about her, Sherlock. Anyway, today's a big day."" 

 

Sherlock mood immediately drops and he grimaces: ""Nothing is ""big"" about today."" 

 

John puts a hand on Sherlock's shoulder to bend down and picks up a bag at his feet: ""It's my daughter's first time in a daycare. I want you to be there."" 

 

""What is the point?"" 

 

""Babies meet other babies. It's kind of a requirement.""

 

Sherlock gathers the baby closer in his arms.

 

""No, it's not. More to the point, she doesn't need anyone else except you and I.""

 

He can spot John's soft smile on the other side of the room as the other man walks around gathering what they need. 

 

""Well, I don't disagree, but she needs to meet babies, too, you know."" 

 

""Oh, other babies will only decay her mind. She needs to be surrounded by intelligent humans. Like us. Not... mindless and smaller people who drool and cry every hour.""


John sends him a blank look: ""Wow. I can't believe I asked you to help me raise my daughter.""

 

Sherlock pushes away the feeling of pride to a corner of his heart and shrugs: ""I've got nothing else better to do. And besides, what kind of detective would I be if I can't solve cases while changing nappies every once in a while?"" 

 

John simply grins and watches as the detective holds up the baby. She touches Sherlock's face with her small hands and Sherlock's smile could light up the universe.

 

...

 

As soon as Sherlock and John arrive at the daycare center Mycroft enrolled her into, Sherlock can't help the disgusted noise escaping his lips.

 

""Oh, what a pleasant surprise. Children drooling all over the floors. How exciting.""

 

John puts a light but calming hand on Sherlock's forearm: ""I told you. Behave. It's not every day we take breaks from solving cases to spend time with my daughter.""

 

The daycare Lady seems to be a sweet woman. Her bright smile is reassuring when she meets them but Sherlock is too preoccupied with the child in his arms to deduce anything about her: ""Hi! You must be the Watsons, it's a pleasure to meet you both.""

 

Sherlock's heart unexpectedly rises up to his throat. 

 

""The Watsons? No, I am Sherlock Holmes, and this is my friend, Dr. John Watson.""

 

""Uh... yeah. We're here to chaperone my daughter on her first day. Are we late?"" 

 

The woman just smiles knowingly: ""You're just in time, please come with me. Sorry about that. Your daughter is going to enjoy it here. Can she walk already?""

 

John's smile can only be described as fond when he answers: ""Yeah. Sherlock just prefers to carry her.""

 

""What? No. No, it's just safer for her this way. Her limbs are strong and far more developed than most infants, yes, but you can never be too careful."" 

 

""Whatever you say, Sherlock. Just let me do the talking this time."" 

 

The daycare lady shows them around until they reach a room with children around the baby's age: ""Okay, so here we are. You can just let your little girl down over there by the other kids. Everyone here is friendly!""

 

Sherlock takes a step back and is stopped by John's frame behind him, pushing him forward:

 

""No. That boy over there just hid a ribbon belonging to that girl and is currently framing that other boy. I am telling you, John. Other children are as sadistic as the criminals we have encountered in past cases.''

 

John's eyes are bright with amusement but he still sends the daycare lady a contrite smile.

 

""Uh, he's kidding. Of course, he is. Just ignore him, that usually does the trick. Sherlock, your brother went out of his way in offering to get my daughter into a good daycare. The last thing I want is getting kicked out."" 

 

""John, I can definitely handle any type of learning strategy you'd like me to try. Your daughter is smarter than any child here. We don't need to be here.""

 

John takes his friend's arm again to guide him out of earshot after sending the lady an apologetic look.  

 

""Sherlock, I know you're worried about her getting attached to people other than us. There's nothing wrong with that. She'll still like you, she'll still come home with us. She just needs to play with children her own age.""

 

Sherlock casts his eyes away: ""It's not about that.""

 

""Then what is it? Why are you being like this?"" 

 

""I don't want anyone else to influence her other than us two. Other people tend to do that and it affects children until adulthood. Your daughter deserves to be around people who are not strangers to us."" 

 

John stares at Sherlock for a moment, and he laughs. Something bright and full of wonder. Sherlock glares at him but his face heats up.

 

""Oh, Sherlock. You'd be a great father."" 

 

Sherlock softens and looks down, his heart beating fast in his chest. He lets the baby down on the mat. She giggles, crawling up to the other children and starts playing. Sherlock's heart warms. How can someone so small be the source of so much love? He crosses his arms to his chest, already missing the warmth of the child in his arms.

 

""I could be reading the introduction of biochemistry to your daughter right now.""

 

John snorts: ""You really do ignore me when I say that those textbooks aren't bedtime stories, huh?"" 

 

He turns around to look at John, pretending to be offended: ""Those textbooks are educational, John. Unlike the one with a boy climbing a beanstalk that reached the sky, which is scientifically impossible. Something your daughter would know if you let me read to her."" 

 

""Hey, Sherlock? Remember when you used to want to be a pirate?"" 

 

Sherlock draws his shoulders up to his ears, hiding behind the collar of his coat as he feels his face heat again: ""Shut up, John."" 

 

Sherlock sees the parents smile at their own children. It makes him look at John's daughter as well, and he watches her giggle with another baby girl while holding a stuffed horse toy.

 

""You've got to admit, Sherlock, that's cute."" John bumps his shoulder, eyes filled with mirth.  

 

""I would never use the word ""cute"" for anyone other than your daughter."" 

 

John stays silent for a beat and Sherlock tries hard not to look at him, wondering if he said something wrong again. He hears a crisp intake of breath as John seems to collect himself: ""Yeah, but they're cute. Look at her playing with the little horse! Take a photo right now, Sherlock."" 

 

""John, I swear to God. It's as if you enjoy seeing me suffer."" 

 

He can feel his friend closer to his ear as he whispers: ""Do it, or I'll call over those parents to sit next to us.""

 

John is clearly enjoying the way Sherlock is grimacing as he snaps pictures of John's daughter with his phone. If Sherlock takes every picture making sure to voice his complaints, he knows he will never delete them. 

 

""There. Are you happy?""

 

By his side, John is laughing quietly, and Sherlock tries his best to suppress his own smile.

 

""I'm glad I could be of some amusement to you."" 

 

""Come on, just admit it. You like seeing her happy.""

 

Sherlock frowns slightly: ""It's not like I want to see her cry, John. Noise is already an abundance in Baker Street."" 

 

John's voice is barely more than a whisper as he looks at his friend: ""You love her. I know you do.""

 

Well, I love you, Sherlock thinks, but he knows it would be a bit not good to voice it out loud. Especially when everything has been going so well lately.

 

""I can't possibly hate anything that is half you."" 

 

John's breath seems to catch again and Sherlock casts a quick glance his way to find John straightening his shoulders, a faint blush to his cheeks: ""Oh... right. W-Well, that... that's nice of you.""

 

Sherlock and John sit in silence, just watching the baby giggle and play with the others, the noises around them filling the sudden void between them, noises around them, clinging to the words hanging between them, remaining unsaid, as always.

 

John clears his throat and it sounds deafening even in the loud room. He looks down at his hands, avoiding his friend's inquisitive look:

 

""Hm. Isn't this nice? Just two friends. Watching a baby together during their day off.""

 

Sherlock almost grimaces, he turns his head forward looking aimlessly off in the distance:  

 

""Yes, absolutely. Two friends."" 

 

""Well, I can definitely say I never imagined raising her with you, of all people.""

 

Sherlock's head whips around so fast he could've broken his neck:  

 

""What is that supposed to mean?"" he asks, almost offended, ""You think I cannot raise a child?"" 

 

John pales, a nervous hand raking through his hair: ""No, that's not it. I just meant that... you're you and I'm me. I always thought I'd... you know.""

 

Sherlock is just confused now. He straightens and imperceptibly moves away from John's side, hurt.  

 

""No, I don't."" 

 

""Come on, Sherlock. It's been months. I think you know."" 

 

Sherlock frowns at his friend sudden desperation:

 

""Know what?"" 

 

His friend's shoulders visibly sag: ""Never mind.""

 

""No, say what you were going to say.""

 

Still avoiding his friend's eyes, John hesitantly opens his mouth to say something but before any sound can escape it they are distracted by a loud and familiar cry coming from the small crowd. Sherlock almost flies away from his spot to kneel next to John's daughter, panic seizing up his insides. He carefully but frantically checks if she is hurt.

 

""She's fine, Sherlock, but I can't find the horse toy she was playing with.""

 

Sherlock lets out a relieved breath he didn't realize he was holding.  

 

""A toy? She is crying over a toy? Do babies cry over toys a lot?"" 

 

""Says the person who threw a tantrum over hidden cigarettes."" John mumbles, and then louder: ""Go get the toy."" 

 

""It's not here, John."" 

 

John's voice rises: ""Well, bloody look for it, then!"" 

 

They both gain some curious look and Sherlock continues with a loud whisper: ""A missing horse toy. How fascinating. You should write up your account of this excellent case, John."" 

 

John ignores him and turns to his daughter: ""It's okay, darling. Uncle Sherlock's got a plan."" 

 

""This is tedious. Looking for a toy. How did she even lose it? It isn't like the horse can run away. Although, I would understand the urge."" 

 

""Did you find it?"" 

 

""No."" 

 

John raises a challenging eyebrow that Sherlock finds incredibly unnerving: ""You're Sherlock Holmes and you can't find a baby's toy?"" 

 

""Why don't you go look for it, then?"" 

 

""Ooh, if I find it, I'm forever going to hold this against you."" 

 

""Well? Did you find it?""

 

""No..."" John looks around, eyes stopping on every child trying to spot the missing toy: ""But it's probably with some other kid now.""

 

Sherlock huffs and glares at his friend. He knew all of this was a bad idea. And he is always right. ""It is your fault that we are here. Now, your daughter can't even stop crying.""

 

""Stop complaining, you're making it worse."" 

 

The daycare lady appears next to them and addresses Sherlock with a worried look: ""Is there a problem here, Mr Watson?""

 

""Yes, it is entirely possible that one of the offspring here has stolen a toy from my friend's daughter.""

 

John swiftly finds his way between them pointing a finger to his friend:

 

""He's not Mr Watson.""

 

Sherlock ignores the sudden but fierce ache in his chest.

 

""Also, Sherlock, it's just ""children"" and maybe one of them just borrowed it. I'm sure she can find another.""

 

""If it is a horse she wants, then it is a horse she should get."" 

 

Sherlock reaches over to hold the baby's hand, and he hushes her quietly, trying to calm the heartbreaking cries. He can see John smiling fondly behind him.

 

""They're babies, go easy on them."" 

 

Sherlock shakes his head in displeasure: ""They are still thieves if they decide to take the horse from her. It is unacceptable.""

 

John simply laughs. A genuine sound that seems to surprise both of them. Sherlock frowns at him, he can't understand anything he does can make John so genuinely happy. He's been more and more genuinely happy around him these days.

 

""This is not a laughing matter, John! Your daughter is crying!"" 

 

John's eyes are shining so bright when he looks down at them Sherlock's breath catches in wonder: ""No, I know, I know, you just... you're so protective. It's... it's nice.""

 

""Now is simply not the time to be nice because I can spot the white horse in that child's hands. Excuse me."" 

 

Sherlock stands, a determined look on his face John recognizes to be one usually reserved to the worst criminals.

 

""Sherlock, no, no, no, no. Wait!"" 

 

Sherlock bends down to be eye to eye with the culprit.

 

""Hello. You are holding the toy that was initially with that child over there. Can you hand it over?"" 

 

""Sherlock, you can't just take the toy from him."" He glances around, taking in the increasingly mad amount of parents around them: ""Jesus. I'm sorry about my friend, he's just very... protective.""

 

Sherlock ignores him and grips the toy still in the child's hand.

 

""I can and I will. Now, give it.""

 

John can immediately spot the glossy eyes of the child and the rapidly increasing breathing as a storm coming and tries to take Sherlock away from the kid:  

 

""Look, you're going to make him cry! Let's just find her another toy, come on. There's a little sheep over there, we can try that."" He looks down at the child: ""I'm really sorry for my friend here, he's just, you know... trying to be a good parent."" 

 

Sherlock looks away: ""I'm not a parent. I'm a... concerned uncle.""

 

John gives his daughter back to Sherlock. He holds her carefully and she immediately curls up to him and stops crying. The soft hums she lets out as she leans on Sherlock lights a bright light in his chest. He feels like everything is burning inside him. When has everything become so warm? How did he manage to live when everything was so cold? 

 

""I think my daughter loves her concerned uncle very much."" 

 

""Oh, shut up, John.""

 

""You're enjoying this."" 

 

""Enjoying what?"" 

 

John's voice is so incredibly gentle when he answers: ""Being a dad."" 

 

Something unfurls and blooms in Sherlock's chest, growing around his lungs and flowering in his throat and in his heart. He softens again and holds John's daughter closer to inhale her familiar scent.

 

""I don't know what you mean."" He hides a smile behind the child's hair.  

 

John laughs and watches Sherlock put the baby down again to let her crawl to some other toys.

 

""This isn't so bad, hm? Just the two of us, watching her play."" John says as Sherlock stands up again beside him.

 

""I admit, this isn't entirely a traumatic experience.""

 

Sherlock and John watch the giggling child together, both of them are smiling proudly.  

 

John takes a deep breath and seems to ponder for a moment too long, Sherlock immediately tenses up in expectation:

 

""Remember when you said that your name was a girl's name?"" 

 

The world seems to suddenly come to a stand still. All noises around them muted but for the sound of Sherlock's own breath.

 

Sherlock clears his throat, trying to appear nonchalant as the walls of his mind scrumble, close to collapsing: ""Yes. What about it?""

 

""Was that really what you wanted to say?""

 

""John, that was months ago"" Sherlock sighs. 

 

""That didn't really answer my question. What did you want to say?"" 

 

Sherlock takes interest in the floor beneath their feet, in the colourful paintings on the wall, in the blue sky out of the window: ""It doesn't really matter now, surely."" 

 

John sees immediately through the feigned disinterest: ""Maybe it does. You don't know. We never really talked about it. It's been almost a year."" 

 

""You'd prefer to discuss this inside a daycare centre?"" 

 

John's eyebrows rase to his hairline in victory: ""So, there's something to discuss, then?"" 

 

""Yes, maybe there is. You should stop dyeing your hair darker.""

 

John touches his hair again: ""The silver hair thing is just weird. I feel older."" 

 

""It's not a bad thing. Everyone gets old. We've been dying the moment we were born.""

 

John gets closer to him, very slowly, almost imperceptibly, definitely deliberately. Their arms brush against each other.

 

""You're really not letting this go, are you?"" 

 

""Not until you stop dyeing your hair."" 

 

Looking far off the distance, Sherlock can still feel the look of his friend on his face, on his neck, seemingly avoiding his eyes, before stopping on his curly hair. He is not close enough and it still feels suffocating.

 

""It would suit you, you know? The full silver hair, not just the small ones."" 

 

""What, do you think we should switch hair colours now? Don't be absurd, John.""

 

""No, I think we should grow old together."" 

 

Sherlock is startled by the words, and he slowly turns to John who has a calm smile on his face as he watches his daughter. As if what he just said isn't momentous, as if what he just said is evident, as if it didn't shake Sherlock's whole world from its axis. Just them, the two of them against the rest of the world. Until the end. Sherlock stares at him with soft eyes, and with an even softer glow in his chest back yet again.

 

...

 

On the way home, Sherlock stays quiet and just carries the tired little girl in his arms. They reach Baker Street, and Sherlock puts the child to sleep. He rocks the crib as he observes her sleep, her small hands, her eyes, her little nose. His smile turns sad as he lets his fingers brush against her tiny head.

 

""I wonder what your name will be.""

 

He smiles before leaning down to kiss the top of her head lingering for a while. 

 

""Thank you for this wonderful day, Miss Watson. Maybe one day, you and I will do this again, my dear Watson.""

 

Sherlock takes in the room he prepared for her and stares longingly at the baby one last time before quietly closing the door and walking down the stairs. In the living room, he watches John standing by the fireplace, seemingly lost in his thoughts. Feeling the gaze of his friend on his back, John looks up to stare at Sherlock through the mirror.

 

""John, I've been thinking. Don't you think we've seen enough?"" 

 

John's expression is serene but curious as he turns around to face him: ""Enough of what?"" 

 

""Crime, danger. Solving cases. Do you think it's possible in the future that we would have seen enough?""

 

John frowns: ""You saying we should stop?"" 

 

Sherlock has never been the self-conscious kind but he feels the need to cross his arms to protect himself from being too vulnerable:

 

""Well, not right away, of course. I have been thinking about what you said earlier. When we're ready, maybe we can... go elsewhere."" 

 

John takes a step closer: ""Ready for what?"" 

 

""To be in content with each other.""

 

John's smile could light up the entire room: ""Alright, madman. Where should we go?"" 

 

""I heard that Sussex is a good place for cottages. Maybe I can garden, or become a beekeeper. Who knows?""

 

John laughs at the idea, and Sherlock smiles fondly.

 

""It's just a thought, John. Maybe an ordinary life won't be so bad. All it takes is a good companion."" 

 

""Sounds like a plan, Sherlock. I'll think about it."" 

 

""We still need to raise your daughter here. You have decades to think about it. I will wait. In any case, I've always wondered how to take care of bees."" 

 

""I was joking, Sherlock. Of course, I'd come with you. The two of us against the rest of the world, remember?""

 

Only there are three of us now isn't there, Sherlock can't help but think.

 

""So, back to what we were talking about earlier. Is ""Sherlock"" really a girl's name?"" 

 

Sherlock averts his eyes but he feels strangely at peace with the sentence now: ""I think we both know what I truly meant.""

 

John steps even closer: ""Maybe I do. Maybe it can be something that's only between the two of us."" 

 

Sherlock stares into the familiar deep blue eyes and sees everything he feels reflected in them: ""I wouldn't want it in any other way.""

 

Sherlock and John smile softly at one another. And it was enough for them both. No one else mattered. Only the two of them and the family they have made.

 

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

 

''This was a nice change of scene. It should make up for the last one. You did put me in very weird clothes.''

 

Something deflates inside of Sherlock. He takes a look at his friend, and at the walls of 221B seemingly moving with a gentle sway, cradled by a continuous humming sound.

 

""Don't complain, John. Pretend it was Halloween.""

 

John laughs, and Sherlock smiles, something small and broken while watching the crinkles form at the corner of John's eyes.

 

His friend's smile is soft when he looks at Sherlock again:


 


""I had a lovely day, Sherlock.""

 

""I did as well.""

 

""But I think you have something more important to work on right now.""

 

Sherlock can feel the walls around him bounce again even as John stays unmoving. His throat tight, his voice a choked sound as he whispers, dejected:

 

""John... I'm sorry. I tried. I didn't mean to wait so long.""


 


""I know, but you can always come back here.""

 

Sherlock stares at John, an ever calming presence in the chaos of his complicated emotions. He feels a sting at the back of his eyes and realizes he can feel his own eyes fill with tears. Sherlock looks at the mirror to avoid John's eyes.


 


""I am never going to have this life, am I?"" he murmured.

 

John offers an apologetic smile, and he reaches over to take Sherlock's hands into his own. Sherlock looks down to focus on the hand on his. Storing away the feeling.


 


""It was a good run. You had all the details perfect. Even the teacher called us the Watsons.""


 


""Actually, it was Mycroft's enrollment. Seemed like something he would do.""


 


""See? Details. That's good storytelling. I think, as a storyteller, I would be impressed.""

 

Sherlock smiles ruefully at John, clutching their hands tighter, holding on to the feeling while it lasts. John sighs and he stands so close Sherlock can almost feel it on his face. He closes his eyes briefly.

 

""He needs you.""


 


Sherlock's head hangs low.

 

""I know he does, but every once in a while, I wish that he didn't. Things would be much easier.""

 

Even as he voices it out loud, he knows it to be a lie. John sees right through it.


 


""Would it?""

 

""No. No, it wouldn't. I need him to need me. It is the only way I can keep him in my life.""


 


""Well, then. Now that that's out of the way, maybe now you can work on trying to find stuffed animals better.""

 

Sherlock tearfully laughs and just stares at what he could have had if he stopped waiting. He feels the ghost of John's free hand on his face raking through his hair slowly.

 

""Come back to me, Sherlock.""

 

""I will miss you, John."" Sherlock sniffs.


 


""You don't have to miss me. You'll come back here, right?""

 

Sherlock shakes his head: ""No, I won't. I can't. Distractions won't be good. Not with the new crisis waiting for me out there. I need to protect them.""


 


""Well, in that case, maybe you'll find out what our daughter's name is.""

 

Sherlock's heart shatters a little more and he has to bring his free hand to his sternum to try and ease the pain.

 

""She's not our daughter. She will never be our daughter. She was never mine. However, she's half you. Mine or not, she's my family.""

 

John smiles at Sherlock, staring at the small silver decorating his detective's hair.

 

""Good luck, Sherlock. I hope you'll remember your vow.""

 

...

 

Sherlock opens his eyes and finds himself in an awfully familiar car. John and Mary are staring at him with a concern that makes something seize up in his throat. It takes him a few minutes to acknowledge John's hand is on his trying to gently shake him.


 


""You okay? You've been blabbering about a missing horse for a second there."" John asks, voice filled with worry.

 

He tries hard to ignore Mary's sceptical eyebrow: ""Those aren't the only things he said. I still think we should take him to the hospital, John. He could still be hallucinating or something.""

 

Sherlock stares at Mary and looks at her stomach for a moment. His heart drops, and he looks away.

 

For days, Sherlock was so sure he was to die in six months, which is why he did what he did... because Sherlock is the type of person who can never be killed by anyone except by himself. Now that he is back, the only thing he dreads is to watch John grow out his silver hair and raise his daughter with someone else.


 


""No, Moriarty's back. We should be prepared."" Sherlock mumbles, trying to regain some composure. He can't allow himself to be weak, nor to be vulnerable.

 

John's voice is too filled with concern to be described as angry: ""Are you even in a fit state? Look at yourself! How many times did you even go to that bloody mind palace of yours in the span of an hour?""

 

Sherlock stares at John, noticing how his hair is back to his natural blonde colour. Sherlock's chest twists but he flashes him the genuine bright smile he only reserves for his best friend.

 

""I'm fine, John. Have you done something new with your hair? You look marvellous.""

 

John brings a self-conscious hand to his hair and the gesture, so familiar, threatens to overcome Sherlock with the intensity of the feeling it causes. This longing again. He swears he can see a faint blush on John's cheeks.

 

""My hair? What... What are you on about? And, no, you're not fine. We should get you to the hospital.""

 

Sherlock ignores him once again and straightens up in the car, attempting to regain a semblance of composure.

 

""The stage is set, the curtain rises. Moriarty returns and chaos will soon follow. Now is not the time to daydream pathetically about what could have been.""


 


""What do you mean? Daydream?""

 

John's frown of confusion is at odds with Mary's somewhat suspicious and knowing look.

 

""Come along, John! We have a case to discuss! Moriarty's impatience will take effect soon. We shouldn't waste time.""


 


""Sherlock, please. Talk to me. How do you even know you're okay?""


 


""Because, John, between you and me, I always survive the fall.""

 

Sherlock winks because he needs to pretend he is fine, because he needs to pretend he is human, because he needs to pretend he is doing better. He exits the car and closes the door with much more force than expected. John and Mary share a confused look. John sighs, following Sherlock into 221B. Because that's what he does.

 

In the car, Mary frowns and her hand is securely placed on the bump of her stomach. The car starts rolling again and takes her to the home she and her husband share.

Sherlock texting, then throwing back his head and laughing fondly, was a bit more out of the ordinary.

""Huh. He's finally cracked. That's a shame, I had him down for three months from now."" Donovan cocked her head thoughtfully. ""Who won the pool?""

Pointedly ignoring her, Lestrade cleared his throat and asked, ""Sherlock, who are you talking to?""

Sherlock's eyes never left the screen. ""I'm not talking to anyone.""

Oh, for the love of- ""Who are you writing to?""

""My boyfriend.""

The resulting silence was so poignant that even Sherlock noticed. He looked up, blinking in confusion. ""Problem?""

""Your boyfriend,"" Anderson said incredulously.

""That's what I said,"" Sherlock snapped back irritably.

""You. Have a boyfriend.""

""Anderson, did your remaining brain cells finally decide to make a run for it? You are repeating yourself. Incessantly.""

""How much did you pay for him?"" Donovan interjected. ""You didn't get one of those mail order grooms, did you? You can't trust those, they'll take your life savings and run off to the Cayman Islands.""

""All right, that's enough,"" Lestrade said loudly, interrupting before it devolved into a hissy fight - complete with hair-pulling and biting. There were times when he sorely empathized with his grammar school teacher. ""Good on you, Sherlock, but you're at a crime scene. You can text your boy-"" His throat seized. His brain refused to use the words ""Sherlock"" and ""boyfriend"" in the same sentence with a possessive pronoun. ""You can text him later.""

""Hardly."" Sherlock sniffed. ""I'm asking him about the rate of decay of human livers. It's vital to the case.""

Donovan's, ""Why would he know about decaying body parts? Oh god, you've found yourself a serial killer boyfriend, didn't you?"" was drowned out by Lestrade's bellow of, ""Sherlock! You can't just give out details of an ongoing investigation!""

""I'm bending enough rules as it is letting you here-""

""It makes a horrific kind of sense-""

""-just because I let you in doesn't mean you can bring along a playmate-""

""-he'll kill people and bring you bits of them to experiment on. He probably does the shopping too, because he's a provider-""

""-there are rules, you daft git. You may not believe in them, but the rest of us have to follow them if we want to get a conviction!""

""-then you'll snuggle on the sofa and talk about your day. He'll tell you about all the people he murdered, you'll tell him about the most gruesome crimes you solved, and it will all be horribly, horribly domestic.""

Sherlock glowered at them both. ""John's a doctor,"" he snapped at Donovan. To Lestrade, he said, ""And I doubt the Canadians care about a simple inheritance scandal gone wrong.""

Lestrade blinked slowly. ""The Canadians.""

""Oh wonderful, now you're repeating yourself."" Sherlock glared at Anderson. ""Congratulations, Anderson. You actually performed the first case of human-to-human transmission of stupidity.""

""Sherlock!"" Lestrade nearly shouted. ""What do the Canadians have to do with anything?""

Sherlock looked at the sky, the why-must-my-brilliance-be-saddled-with-these-tiny-minded-mortals expression set firmly on his face. Lestrade was very familiar with that expression. They met frequently.

""John's Canadian. And while he's quite talented, I doubt he can affect the British judicial system from Richmond.""

Everyone exchanged looks.

""Sherlock,"" Lestrade said carefully, ""exactly how did you meet, uh, John?""

""Over the internet.""

The poignant silence from before was back, along with its friends Awkward and Holy Fuck.

""Oh god,"" Donovan moaned. ""Why couldn't you have found yourself a nice serial killer?""

 



*

 

""How is your penpal, dear?""

""He's not my penpal, Mrs. Hudson, he's my boyfriend.""

""Of course, dear.""

 



*

 

You can't date someone over the internet. Mummy won't approve. MH

Piss off. SH

 



*

 

Lestrade had hoped Sherlock would get bored and abandon the whole internet-boyfriend-from-Canada business.

He didn't. If anything, he got even more infatuated.

""You lot cannot possibly be this stupid!"" Sherlock threw his hands in the air. ""If John was here, he'd have figured it out ages ago!""

They heard that a lot now. If John was here. John said this. John said that. John would smote the ground and out would spring their murderer, already handcuffed and paperwork complete.

It had been going on for months. It was getting to the point where Lestrade twitched every time he heard the name ""John.""  

Donovan, however, had reached the end of her tether. ""Oh, will you come off it!""

Sherlock sneered at her. ""I wouldn't get on it if you lot would do your jobs! Honestly, John-""

""John's not real! He's never been real! He's someone you made up so the rest of us think you're more human or something!""

""Oh, and what led you to such a brilliant deduction?"" Sherlock practically snarled. ""Do share, Sergeant Donovan. I do so enjoy listening to your attempts at logic.""

""Enough!"" Lestrade barked. ""Donovan, secure the scene. Sherlock, with me.""

Lestrade led Sherlock to a quiet corner. Sherlock glared at him, an odd mix of defiant and apprehensive.

""John's real. He has a blog. That's how I found him.""

""Yeah, I believe you. I'm sure John exists. But Sherlock,"" Lestrade took care to gentle his tone, ""do you know him?""

""Of course I do! He's a doctor, formerly of the Canadian Forces Medical Services. He's terrible with technology and he-""

""Have you met him? Do you even know what he looks likes?""

Sherlock made a disgusted sound. ""I like him for his mind. I couldn't care less what he looks like.""

""Sherlock,"" Lestrade sighed. ""I know this might be hard to hear, but John may not be who you think he is.""

""I know exactly who he is.""

""Are you sure?"" Lestrade pressed. ""Are you absolutely positive that you know him? The internet can hide a lot about a person. No one can deduce everything from some e-mails and a blog. Not even you.""

For a split second, Sherlock looked stricken. He quickly regained his usual impassivity, but Lestrade could see the beginnings of doubt flickering in his eyes.

""Look, John might be who he says he is. Or he might be some kid playing you for fun, or a lonely old woman. The point is, you can't know. Not in this sort of situation.""

It was a much more subdued Sherlock who returned to the crime scene. He solved the case with his usual efficiency and without his usual acerbic wit.

He didn't mention John again.

 



*

 

A week later, Lestrade stopped by 221B Baker Street to check in on Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson answered the door.

""Oh, I'm afraid you just missed him, Detective Inspector. He left for a case abroad.""

A prickle of alarm crept up his spine. ""It's not in Canada, is it?""

""Canada? No, I think I heard him say something about Belarus.""

""Oh. Well, good. When he comes back, could you tell him to give me a call?""

""Of course, dear.""

Lestrade made his way back to New Scotland Yard, feeling a small swell of relief. It looked like Sherlock had actually listened to him for once and was getting his life back on track.

Brilliant. The sooner they put the imaginary boyfriend debacle behind them, the better.

 



*

 

Lestrade didn't see Sherlock for another month. Not until a particularly strange triple homicide had him texting Sherlock with, ""Get your arse over here or I'm handing the entire thing over to Dimmock.""

""Don't you dare touch that, Anderson!""

Sherlock bounded on to the scene, coat flapping dramatically behind him. Lestrade's greeting died in his throat as a short, stocky blonde man followed him in. He was dressed in jeans and a canvas military jacket, and was watching the goings on with mild interest.

""Sherlock, what did I tell you about crime scenes not being your personal playdates?""

Sherlock gave him a scathing look, but the stranger responded before he could.

""Oh, sorry. I figured I wasn't supposed to be here. I'll just wait outside, Sherlock.""

Sherlock frowned. Donovan looked up from where she was crouched over the body, surprise evident on her features. ""You're American?""

The man flashed her a grin. ""Canadian, actually.""

Everyone froze.

""Canadian,"" Lestrade finally said, voice a bit faint. ""You wouldn't happen to be called John, would you?""

The bloke smiled, somewhat confusedly. ""Uh, yeah. Dr. John Watson. Hello."" He held out his hand.

Lestrade shook it, more out of reflex than anything because his mind had conveniently crashed like a shoddy Microsoft product.

Sherlock just looked monstrously smug.

All activity had stopped. Everyone was too busy staring at the man to do their jobs. Lestrade would have yelled at them, except his brain still had yet to reboot. From the amount of time it was taking, it was probably running Windows Vista.

John looked back at them bemusedly and jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. ""Should I go?""

""No."" Sherlock was suddenly across the room and standing right in front of John, their chests just shy of touching. ""Stay. I'm going to need you.""

John smiled up at him, the corners of his eyes crinkling. Sherlock didn't smile back, but his face visibly softened.

As Sherlock poked around the body, Donovan sidled up to the man. ""So you're the infamous John.""

""I'm not sure about infamous, but yeah.""

""Are you a serial killer?""

""Um, no.""

""The Freak over there might be."" Donovan gave him a once over, taking in the checked shirt and woolly jumper. ""You seem normal enough.""

""Thanks?""

""He's been telling us that you're his boyfriend, you know. For ages.""

""Really?"" John frowned. ""That's weird.""

Donovan had the vindicated look of someone who knew that the rules of normalcy and rationality would reassert themselves over the world. ""Yes, it is.""

""He proposed to me months ago.""

The reassertion was short-lived.

John called across the room. ""Hey, you haven't changed your mind, have you?""

""Don't be an idiot,"" Sherlock scoffed. ""We're waiting. Mummy wants a summer wedding.""

""Yeah, well, just remember my visa runs out in a few months.""

""Hardly. Mycroft's already getting your dual citizenship confirmed. He'll have the papers by Tuesday.""

""Huh. That's...nice."" John wrinkled his nose. ""What does your brother do again?""

""Never mind that, John. Come take a look at the body.""

John glanced at Lestrade for permission. Lestrade mutely waved him over. He needed a lie down, and maybe a cold flannel. Or scotch. Lots and lots of scotch.

Donovan stepped up beside him and silently handed him a Mars bar. Lestrade finished it in two bites.

""Unbelievable.""

""Yeah.""

""There are so many ways it could have gone wrong. It should have gone all wrong,"" Donovan mused.

""Mm.""

""Leave it to him to beat the odds. And get himself a cute boyfriend."" Donovan sighed. ""There's no justice in the world.""

John was murmuring something to Sherlock, gesturing at one of the bodies. He pointed at the fingernails of one hand and then the head. Sherlock whooped, seized John by the collar, and kissed him thoroughly.

Donovan watched avidly. ""Oh my.""

""You got something, Sherlock?"" Lestrade asked with the air of someone who had been so traumatized that he had simply accepted living as a scarred shell for the rest of his life.

""Twins!"" Sherlock shouted as he ran past them. ""Come along, John!""

John trotted after him, waving cheerfully at Lestrade and Donovan as he passed by.

Lestrade pinched the bridge of his nose. ""God help us. There are two of them.""

Donovan made a thoughtful sound. ""I wonder if we'll be invited to the wedding?""","['idk_some_random_fanboy', 'Metamorfosica', 'ghost_of_communism', 'picotonico', 'namgibrain', 'hereditario', 'asav', 'Rosepunzel', 'Sunde135',
